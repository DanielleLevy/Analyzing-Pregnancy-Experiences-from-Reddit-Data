".... they ain't lying.

Shit guys.... just got a very faint line on a prego stick. We've got two little ones and because I am so so bad at pregnancy we decided no more and hubby got snipped. My period is a couple days late so I did a pee stick and it looks like we're having number 3 now. 

I'm excited and terrified. When I say bad at pregnancy I mean almost died both times with blood clots, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes just for the extra shits and giggles. So that part I'm not looking forward to at all, but I guess at least I know to expect the forthcoming hell. But then after... another tiny human to join our little family. So exciting. 

I told husband and he just looked at me and said ""shit... oh shiiiit..... but the *makes snip motion with fingers*??? Wow"". Then he went quiet for a bit whilst I jabbered about vasectomies so I asked if he was ok and he just said ""yeah I was just thinking of names"". Heart. Melted.

I hovered over unsubscribe on this sub a week or so ago but didn't for some reason. 

Thanks for letting me ramble-share!",26.0,6.3977109609749085,26.0,0.102,0.738,0.16,0.9237,1071,3,0.6374601587400787,2.6519999999999997

"Is this just in alignment with the current issues of the world, or could something mentally be going on? 

Male/57/approx. 117kg (unknown height - fairly tall. I’m 180cm and he’s a bit taller than me)/ diabetes type 2, hypertension, some liver issues. On a bunch of meds. Unsure of names sorry. Lives in Australia. 

Just out of nowhere lately he’s reading and believing all these conspiracy theories - and some are so out there. He’s not getting a flu jab anymore because he thinks the government is gonna control us with it. When he talks about them, he seems normal, even does so with a sort of tone that implies he knows it’s a bit ridiculous, but he honestly really believes it. When he’s alone with my mum, I hear him talking about them more seriously. 

He’s a very clever man. Always got top marks in everything he’s done. Has a first degree in history (that’s like the best marks you can get on a degree in the UK), and a teaching degree. Could someone like this just suddenly start believing in conspiracy theories like this, is it a normal progression for some? Or could something else be going on?

Edited to add: 

I am sorry I haven’t responded. I am a bit overwhelmed at all the comments, and the responses. I’ll try and cover some main responses in this comment.

1) I know history teacher doesn’t = smart. But I meant it when I said he’s smart. He has immense general knowledge, and could have done many things before choosing to be a teacher in his 40s. He worked in science labs as a younger man. I’m not bragging, just trying to demonstrate that he has the mental cognition skills and isn’t lacking, which makes this more perplexing to me. 

2) I asked my mum what she thought of this and she just laughed it off and said he’s “crazy”, but not in a concerned way. She is not very good at dealing with any emotions or deep issues and would never seriously address this, hence why I came here. 

3) He has always been an anxious person, not in contact with his family (we moved countries 12 years ago) and has mood issues. He used to be very angry growing up, but has actually mellowed the last few years. He’s still fairly mellowed now. He tends to have an obsessive personality, so maybe it’s just manifesting in this.

4) he doesn’t really have more time on his hands. In my country (Australia) and state, schools stayed open and he worked like usual. He’s just started school holidays for 2 weeks which may be leading to his increases searching, but this started when he had his usual routine. 

5) I’m not scared of him doing anything crazy (it’s crossed my mind, but I have anxiety issues too and think it’s just that), I’m just worried for him that this could be the start of mental health issues or Alzheimer’s or something. His mum is still alive. Dad died of diabetes complications over 15 year  ago I think.

6) he is on a bunch of medications, but no recent changes to them. But I guess the build up could be contributing.

7) he keeps back flipping quite a lot. One second he says covid is fake and just the flu and just being used to control us, the next second he tells me to be careful of covid when going out. And both times he seems just as serious.  Does this indicate its more or less likely to be an actual medical problem?

"27F, 165 lbs, 5'4"", no medications

My wife had a small (golf ball) ovarian cyst and one of her ovaries removed at 18 after it burst causing extreme pain and other complications.

 She had our daughter at 24 with a uneventful pregnancy, but ended up having a C section because labor would not progress. 

After the birth she believed she felt a hernia in her abdomen, and had a CT scan done to verify that was the case. They determined there was a hernia present, but another large cyst was discovered on the remaining ovary. We researched fertility preservation options over a year period and ended up deciding against all of it. She had her remaining ovary removed about a year after the cyst was discovered, that made her infertile around 26. Sad situation for our whole family at the time


Now my wife is about to turn 28  and a while back she had been feeling sick for a few weeks and decided to take a pregnancy test to get it out of her mind. Shes 22 weeks along and we are all (including the doctor that delivered our daughter and removed the remaining ovary) completely mystified. Nobody understands how my wife could be pregnant. I still have trouble grasping the idea myself.

The only explanation the OB could give is that either he or the doctor that removed the first ovary (different Doc) left a small piece of ovary behind unintentionally. 

We have been dating since she was sixteen and I was there for both surgeries. I heard both docs say that they were unable to save either Ovary. 

Has anyone ever heard of this? Is there any other possible explanation? Should my wife resume hormone replacement after the birth and possible breastfeeding period? She was on hormones before because she was considered to be menopausal. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I fell asleep and alot of questions got asked overnight. I answered them as best I could. Thank you all for your comments and questions and most of all congratulations! We are stoked to have one more and cant wait to meet her!",36.0,7.2014126075364775,36.0,0.049,0.876,0.075,0.9212,2011,3,0.6532462338354886,1.764

Micah has been in the hospital since the day he was born prematurely, for almost 4 months now. In that time he has continued to grow steadily, but has made very little progress with his various medical concerns. His lungs and respiratory needs were finally beginning to improve in January, but his abdomen began to unexpectedly fill with transudate fluid and grow massively. The doctors at Children's Hospital Los Angeles know that he has some form of ascites, but are unable to determine the source nor the cause. They have performed multiple MRIs, MRV’s, blood tests, blood transfusions, 2 rounds of paracentesis, have cultured the fluid that has been drained, done a barium enema, colon biopsy, tested the functioning of his liver, kidneys, and intestines… And still have not been able to reach any conclusion as to where this fluid is accumulating from. “The clinical picture just does not match his scans/tests,” they say, “this baby is a mystery!” One thing is certain, however; Micah’s condition is critical and he is running out of time as his belly grows bigger and bigger every day. The fluid is now pushing up on his lungs and limiting their ability to expand and grow. We are seeking second, third, even fourth opinions at this time, but that is not easy to do given the global status, and transferring to another hospital is currently much too challenging an option. Therefore, we are sending out this call for help and ask that you please re-post this plea to your stories and pages in hopes that it may reach someone who may have even some nugget of a notion as to what Micah is experiencing.

"Hello, 
 
First, I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses, and medical staff during this global crisis. You are the true warriors in this earthly fight. And I am constantly praying on your behalf. 


I am the mother of a 3 year old with spastic quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy and periventricular leukomalacia. My son has multiple chronic medical conditions such as chronic lung disease, neurological disorders, developmental delay, high aspiration risk, airway clearance impairment, etc. He was born at 24 weeks and was on ventilation for nearly three months in the NICU where we stayed for 151 days. To top it off, I have a history of pulmonary embolism and hypertension. 


I am trying my best to figure out how to help myself and my loved ones. I could not convince my boyfriend to stay home from work so he started staying at his parents house (staying 6ft away from them at all times if and when the rare times he does see them as they are at higher risk too) but now I am fearful of lockdowns and being separated from him during this madness, apart from that, the longer he stays there the more risk he has of infecting his elderly dad. So I am trying to protect both my son and his father. 

Thus, I’ve blocked off a room in my home to quarantine him and observe his symptoms if any at all. (He has decided to stop going to work finally) But how long should he wait to come out of quarantine ? I can’t live with myself knowing I did not do all that I possibly could to protect my baby. 

He plays a vital role in my sons care and I don’t have anyone else. I am grateful for any advice. 

I have a medical background so please don’t hold back.",34.0,7.031862314348958,34.0,0.08,0.81,0.11,0.8543,1665,1,0.72720661758022,2.72
"I saw this article come up about a $1M hospital bill for a NICU baby. The TLDR is that the mother did not add the baby to her health plan within 30 days, and coverage was subsequently denied.

"My husband tested positive for COVID-19 so I called the hospital to be told they had a quarentined labour and delivery room and it would be no problem.  The next morning (28.03.2020) I went into labour. When I arrived at the hospital 6 hours into labour at 38+2 the hospital decided they had changed their minds and my husband could no longer join me after I had already left him in the car to go check in.

What you might be expecting is a sad and traumatic birth story but too be honest it was the most empowering thing I've ever done in my life. 

It took me about 3 or 4 hours of video calling my husband, parents and sister to calm down and accept that this baby was coming either way so I needed to come to terms with it. My labour progressed incredibly slowly and I had contractions  5 minutes apart from 7am until around 10pm on day one. At 10pm I was only 3cm dilated so was offered oxytocin to speed up contractions or mild pain relief so I could sleep and see how things progressed. My waters had broken at 10am and so I couldn't leave the hospital and was on regular antibiotics. I decided to let my body decide how things progressed and took some pain relief that allowed me to sleep until 12.30. I then dozed between contractions until 4.30am. 

At 4.30 I was still only 3cm dilated and was offered oxytocin again which I turned down. I managed to breathe through the contractions until 5.30am when I took another dose of pain relief and slept for another hour. These contractions were a real turning point for my mental and emotional state. I wanted my husband to rest so he could be with me for the big day to come and so I focused myself and worked through them alone. I allowed myself to see how strong and capable I really was. 

At 10am my contractions were steady and mild still but I had made it to 6cm dilated. The hospital had to give me oxytocin at this point as my waters had been broken for 24 hours. Over the next 4 hours my contractions became much stronger and more regular and I dilated to 8cm by about 3.30pm. I took one more dose of pain relief at 2.30pm - it was too mild to help the contentions but allowed me to feel calm in the breaks. Throughout the whole day my husband was on video call and talked me through contractions giving me words of support. 

At 4.30pm my contractions were very strong and I could no longer communicate much with my husband. I had short 1 minute breaks between them  but unfortunately was still only 9cm dilated. At this point my midwife and doctor strongly recommended that I took an epidural due to the length of my labour and the strength of the contractions (added to the fact that I was alone they were very worried I was going to become exhausted). I turned down the epidural and decided to power through. The final cm of dilation was incredibly painful, I was in a quarantined room and only had one midwife able to be present with me so when she had to leave me to prepare the room for birth I found dealing with these last contractions alone very difficult. I allowed the idea of giving up enter my head for 1 second before I banished it forever. 

It was finally time to push. A doctor put on protective gear and the three of us were locked away in our quarantined room with my husband on video call at the head of the bed. I had to push for around 30 minutes and required manual help for around 3 or 4 contractions from the doctor. Team green gained a little girl called Katalina Grace at 18.01. 

Unfortunately she had some difficulty breathing and a mild infection from my waters. She was whisked away before I could touch her and taken to the intermediate care ward which I wasn't allowed to access due to the quarantine. She weighed in at 7lbs 5.5oz and 50cm and during the night she recovered to full health. I am met her for the first time st 1pm the following day.

Don't get me wrong, giving birth alone was the last thing I thought I could cope with, and at times it seemed like I was facing an impossible task but to reassure any mamas out there that may be facing the same thing, you've got this. You are strong and you are capable. I will never forget the strength I found within myself and  I have made my husband and family immeasurably proud; they are in awe of me. If I'm honest, I'm in awe of myself and I now know that I can conquer whatever life throws at me. Please get in touch with me if you are scared or end up in a similar position. 

At the end of 36 of the hardest hours of my life I have a beautiful little girl that will always know how hard her mummy worked for her and the love that surrounded it all.",17.0,10.076846044425965,17.0,0.078,0.787,0.135,0.9962,4626,0,0.5777349825938819,1.326

" 

So I have been having the hardest year of my life with my current husband with whom I have been with for a total of 7 years. We met in our mid twenties and generally had a pretty happy relationship. Things started to go south slowly in mid 2017 with the pressure of getting engaged, planning a wedding and dealing with our difficult and dysfunctional families. In addition we were also starting our careers, living in a HCOL area and generally figuring out adulthood. We are also two very different people who came to blows over many differences and were generally poor with conflict resolution.

We had our lows but would always find a way out and be happy again.

At the start of this year, however, things seem to slowly unravel. My husband suddenly started getting panic attacks this January. Seeing as he was someone who never had anxiety or panic attacks, he was very disturbed by this. He genuinely thought he was dying, and had breakdowns. I took him to the ER, and called the EMTs multiple times at 3 am as he would wake up in a panic saying he was dying. They all cleared him saying he was healthy.

Around March he went to a GP for a checkup who looked at his EKG, read it incorrectly and told him he was dying. Within 30 minutes he called my husband back and said actually he made an error and everything was normal. This seemed to have really spooked my husband to the core. After that for the next few weeks he thought he had heart troubles and would not listen to me as I tried to reason with him.

I finally had him visit a cardiologist who indeed confirmed his heart was fine. We then went back to his GP who said that my husband was suffering from extreme stress and anxiety and needed to be put on medication. She prescribed him 10 mg Lexapro. The Lexapro was a god sent in the sense that it finally erased his panic attacks and shortness of breath. Things seem to finally slowly calm down and go back to normal.

A few weeks on Lexapro I started to notice slight changes in his personality. Suddenly he was colder and more distant. The soft, warm sweetness of his personality was replaced by coldness and anger. Now that his panic attacks and anxiety were gone, suddenly everything else was wrong. He said he hated his job that he previously loved and excelled at. He said he was bored and wanted to quit to join the police academy or start his own business, His family and I cautioned him that he needed to not act suddenly and think things through. Anything we said that wasn't affirmative was met with resistance and anger.

He also started drinking heavily. While my husband has always liked to drink, his daily 2 glasses of wine have now turned into a bottle of wine per night. He also goes out with his friends and gets blasted drunk and parties and bar hops until 2- 3 am in the morning. When I tell him he needs to come home earlier, he gets mean and aggressive and tells me to stop being a fun killer!

Suddenly I am his enemy no.1. He seems to have re-written our entire story where everything about our relationship and marriage is wrong. He hates and resents me for the hurt I have caused him and says he feels trapped and caged. He screams at me, yells at me and has scary episodes. For example, if he comes home at 2 am after bar hopping and I say anything about him staying out too late, he will walk into the kitchen, grab a bottle of wine say he is getting out of here and go lock himself in our car!!

He has also started sexting and chatting and calling with random women from hook up apps. I discovered him receiving nudes from a woman a month ago. When I confronted him about it he screamed at me that he wanted a divorce and ran away to stay with his parents. Another time when I tried to confront him again he screamed at me, took his bottle of wine and locked himself out side in our car. When I tried to go outside and get him to come inside and stalk to me like a normal person, he screamed at me and drove off drunk into the night at 3 am. He did not return home until an hour later.

Recently I discovered that he has been having sex with hookers in hotel rooms. He has recently started not coming home or coming home late after work. He always stays at the office until 3- 4 am and sexts chats and sends nude selfies to random women based on what I have seen on his phone.

If he does come home, he will stay up till 3 am by himself watching a movie and drinking.

Occasionally he will seem to have a moment of clarity, apologize profusely and tell me he doesn't know what he is doing. He gets these extreme rushes of emotions and he cant seem to control himself. The rest of the time when I bring up that something isn't normal he says I am the enemy and he hates me and I need to leave him alone and throws a tantrum and runs away.

I am at my wits end. I do not know what is going on with him. He is an asshole or is he suffering from some mental health issue?

TLDR; My 31 year old husband has been acting increasingly erratic, aggressive, mean and is cheating on me. I don't know what to do as this all seems very out of character.",33.0,10.953316381003408,33.0,0.157,0.774,0.069,-0.9986,5116,1,2.275032603970439,5.181
"My wife and I are now 1 week on the other side with our little girl. There are so many things I wish I could go back and tell my ‘last month’ self to do to prep for her arrival. Since I can’t do that, I’ll share here in case they are useful to others (Dads or Moms). 

1. Shelves! - Nursing happens in many locations around the house and early on it can be an hour long process. As good partners should do, you will be bringing lots of supplies to your wife as she nurses - drinks, burp cloths, pillows, phones, remotes, ice packs, cold grapes from the fridge to put on the baby’s cheek to keep them awake (if it works, it works!)... So if I could go back I would put low shelves on every wall near a soft surface because chances are nursing’s I’ll happen there. Those TV trays with legs that slide under couches would also be really helpful. 

2. Lights - As A good Dad, you’ll be doing a lot of consoling which means pacing throughout the apartment until you can attempt the Mission Impossible - lay her down without waking her (or your wife) up. On night one I was pacing in the dark trying to turn in a light switch with my elbow because I was terrified to take both hands off my daughter. The next day I bought a bunch of low light motion nightlights for around the place and it made a huge difference. I also put a dimmer in the bedroom so that I could bring her to my wife for late nursing without blinding her awake. If you have LEDs, the Lutron dimmers let you set the range very low so it is very faint light. At 3 AM, it’s plenty. 

3. Stretching - maybe not a problem for younger Dads, but for the late 30s guys like me you might want to prep your body better than I did. Holding up 8 lbs for an hour with your arms fully frozen will hurt more and more. You will also constantly be deciding between your own comfort and the risk of waking the baby if you shift positions. (Spoiler - keeping the baby asleep will win)

4. Buy Tupperware - we have been lucky to have friends and family bring us a lot of food, usually in a big casserole dish. This is amazing except after a few days your fridge real estate will be taken up by big containers with a single serving left. So we have started to transfer things into Tupperware when we get them. 

5. Set up and practice nursing timing apps - Early on you may need to keep close track of when the baby eats and die how long. On a rested mind this sounds simple - just time with your phone and write it down. On only a few hours of sleep trying to help my wife log, I look back at my notes which make no sense whatsoever. It makes it really hard to say “did the baby eat enough today”.  We now use an app but needed to create accounts and link both our phones so the data would sync. (Again - simple task on a rested brain, rocket science on day #3 at home post birth).  Also helpful to do some timing dry runs. Your wife’s hands might be busy holding so you will need a system of her shouting “left breast done - clock the right!!” so you can log it while doing dishes/laundry/etc. We tried a few and like this one -

"On Wednesday I was inducted at 38 weeks and had my wonderful baby Theodore at 1:12 am on Thursday, at 20"" long and 7 lbs 4 oz. 

My pregnancy was smooth sailing until around halfway through, in early-mid June I had an ob/gyn appointment and complained that I was very constipated and was starting to have pain because of it. I wasn't worried at this point and was told to take colace, which I did. About a week later I still hadn't pooped and started throwing up everything that I ate. I was taking so much colace, prune juice, fiber bisuits, tried two enemas, but nothing helped. I stopped being able to sleep because the pain was so bad. After 3 days of not holding down food I stopped being able to hold down any liquids either. I called my obgyn and was advised to go to the ER to be evaluated and get fluids. 

I went to the ER and was told the nausea and vomiting were just morning sickness (even though I hadn't had any in two months) and that constipation was normal in pregnancy, just take some colace. I was given fluids and released. The next day I was throwing up about every half hour, went back to the ER, was given more fluids and told I had hyperemisis gravidarum. I knew something was very wrong at this point but the ER doctor just brushed off all my concerns.

The next day, after being unable to hold down food for almost a week and liquids for 3 days, I started vomiting up brown smelly liquid about every 15 minutes. I knew there was nothing in my stomach and quickly google diagnosed myself as having fecal vomiting (stuff in the intestines backflowing into my stomach) and a bowel obstruction. My husband called the ob and the ob called ahead to the ER to tell them this was not normal and I needed to see a GI specialist. 

This time I was taken seriously and had an x-ray done, which showed I might have a bowel obstruction. Then a CT scan which showed I definitely had a bowel obstruction. The GI surgeon came to speak to me and told me the reason my intestines hadn't ruptured yet was because the fecal vomiting was relieving pressure on them, but the large intestine was stretched beyond repair and would need to be removed. If I didn't have surgery ASAP my intestines would end up rupturing, or dying as the blood flow was cut off in them because of the swelling. I would wake up from surgery with an ileostomy (similar to a colostomy). The anesthesia could induce labor in which case my baby at 21w6d would not survive. I'm already afraid of surgery and the surgeon had never operated on a pregnant woman before, so I was terrified heading into surgery but knew I would die without it. 

I was in surgery for 5 hours, and woke up to be told that the obstruction was caused by a large tumor. The ileostomy bag was very disheartening to me but I've since adjusted to it well enough. The cancer cells had started to spread outside the colon and onto the lymph nodes, and I would need treatment. It was the worst day of my life, it felt like my world was crashing down around me. The only good news was the baby made it through the surgery just fine. 

We didn't initially think I could do chemo during pregnancy, but after meeting with several maternal fetal medicine specialists it turns out chemo is fairly safe during pregnancy because the placenta does a pretty good job protecting the fetus. 

I completed 5 rounds of chemo during pregnancy (7 more to go) and had constant doctor's appointments to do non-stress tests and growth ultrasounds to make sure baby was doing well, all of which he did great on. My weight was a big concern since I'd been at my pre-pregnancy weight still and then lost 15 lbs during the time I wasn't eating and during hospitalization. It took me the rest of the pregnancy to gain that back. 

My doctors decided to induce me at 38 weeks to fit into my chemo schedule and make sure I didn't have to stop treatment for too long. I was eager to have my baby because I was so exhausted of dealing with late pregnancy, the chemo side effects, and working full time as well. 

So on Wednesday I went in to be induced, 16 hours after starting pitocin I delivered my beautiful baby boy. I had an epidural which was great, my first baby I went into labor on my own and it progressed so quickly I wasn't able to get an epidural and honestly thought this must feel like what dying from a gut wound feels like it was so painful. With the epidural I could still feel contractions but not pain which was great. It was very weird being basically temporarily paralyzed from the waist done though. When I was transferred from the labor to the recovery room I tried pulling myself onto the stretcher with my legs dragging behind me and my husband told me I looked like a dying animal. 

I'm not able to breastfeed because the chemo medicines/poisons transfer into the breastmilk but bottle feeding has been nice because my husband and I can take shifts at night staying up with the baby so I can actually have a decent stretch of sleep. We're so happy to have home with us after such a stressful pregnancy and he is such a cute little guy. My husband and daughter and I are all in love with him. :)

"I'm a 23 year old woman and I've been suffering ever since I first got my period 11 years ago. Several gynecologists have suggested I have endometriosis but they never actually never tested me for it. I've been on the pill since I was 18 but it doesn't solve my uterine problems. It does take away the symptoms but I often experience paralysing cramps and heavy bleeding during my period. I once had a period that lasted 40 days.
Last cycle I decided to skip the pill and it was the worst cycle I have ever had. The ovulation was very painful and the pain faded very slowly. My period came a week early and lasted 5 days. Those days have been hell. The bleeding was extreme and the cramps made me throw up and have diarrhea at the same time for hours. I got sick when I stood up. My uterus felt as if it was filthy water balloon in my belly.
This reminded me I'll probably have to deal with this for 30 more years. I want to look into getting my uterus removed and don't feel like dying every month. I've never wanted any children so I donkt think I'd ever regret such a procedure.
The only thing holding me back is the fact that I'm very scared of getting surgery. Anaesthesia scares me a lot. I don't like the idea of people cutting into me.
On the other side my uterus disgust me and I get sick thinking about it.
I'm from Belgium so if I decide to get the procedure my insurance will cover the costs if tests prove the procedure is necessary to improve my health.

"Hello all! 

&#x200B;

So I'm going to preface this by saying I'm really effing proud of myself. The end of this pregnancy was cuh-ray-zee. 

&#x200B;

My story starts exactly two months ago, when my two year old heart warrior woke up looking puffy. After a local ER visit it was determined that she had fluid on her heart & we were transferred to children's hospital two hours from home. 

&#x200B;

We are still here 🙃 after a valve replacement, multiple set backs and a hell off a climb by my sweet girl to get back to health, we're finally just a couple days from discharge. 🙌

&#x200B;

Since the hospital is 2 hours from home, my husband and I have lived in her hospital room this entire time. I surrendered my worry since I had no control over when I'd go into labor or how long we'd be stuck here. The last few weeks of my pregnancy I would just wake up every morning praying thank you that he wasn't born last night & repeat that when I'd go to bed. Hoping but not setting any expectations that we could be home before he was born. 

&#x200B;

Like the perfect child he is, he held on as long as he could and labor did not start until I was 41 weeks exactly. 

&#x200B;

I had an induction appointment scheduled for mid morning on February 28th but I woke up at around 3 AM and just felt off. I couldn't get comfortable and I woke up my husband and traded the recliner I usually sleep in for the couch but that didn't help. Then I tried climbing in my daughter's hospital bed with her but that didn't work either. Around 5 AM contractions started and were 10 minutes apart. The hospital I was delivering at was a 4 minute drive away. 

&#x200B;

Since I was at 4 cm at my last appointment and this is my 4th delivery, I decided to head out. 

&#x200B;

We had made the decision to have my husband drop me off at L&D and go back to my daughter. My Dad and Sister live nearby but are not fit to be support for the actual birth. My cousin offered to be there too, but after such a long time riding the out of control roller coaster with my daughter's hospital stay, the idea of doing it alone sounded really appealing to me. I'm not sure how to make that idea make sense, other than to say birthing babies is something that makes me feel very powerful and in control as I work with my body and baby. I craved a situation that I felt power in so strongly at that point that I wanted to be alone with it. 

&#x200B;

So I did 🙂. I spent about an hour laboring in triage before they checked my cervix. Contractions were painful but manageable and the check revealed I was at 6 cm already. So I was sent to a delivery room and labored another hour before I got my epidural. That time was a little stressful because my contractions were ramping up in intensity and 2 minutes apart. I did not want to deliver without the epi. But I got it in time and tried to sleep. 

&#x200B;

About an hour later, I was woken up by intense pressure. All my other kids transitioned in one graceful motion when they were born and I recognized the feeling and knew it was showtime. I'd gone from 7cm and zero station to 10 cm head visible in that hour.

&#x200B;

The doctor took forever to come in and they asked me to not push and that was really hard. I could hear him talking to someone outside my room and wanted to yell for him to hurry the fuck up lol. 

&#x200B;

The nurse coached me through pausing to wait for a contraction to push to prevent tearing and I'm so glad she did. I pushed 4 times and was ready for the 5th and it felt verrrrry intense and I didn't feel like I could progress on that push like I had with the others. The nurses literally bent me in half, feet back by my ears and I was able to push him out on that push. 

&#x200B;

Cade Marcus weighed in at 10 lbs 4 oz with a 14.5 inch head lol. Huge. My other babies were all under 8 lbs. My nurse was right about the pushing, I didn't end up tearing which is a small miracle in my opinion. Haha.

&#x200B;

My family came after that and helped after I got to my recovery room. I had a rough go at first because when my epi was placed, the anesthesiologist unknowingly punctured the dural membrane in my spine and I ended up with a spinal migraine. The puncture caused cerebral fluid to leak through the hole and I had an excruciating headache unless I was laying flat on my back. 

&#x200B;

They did a weird procedure to fix it where they did a second epidural but injected my blood instead of medicine and my blood sealed the hole. Thankfully I got instant relief from it. I guess that complication only has a 1 in 1000 chance of happening. Lucky me. Lol. 

&#x200B;

We're doing our best in this situation as we wait for my daughter to be discharged. The hospital made an exception to the RSV precautions that are in place and allow the baby in my daughter's room with us. So he and I are here during the day and Ronald McDonald House at night and my husband is with my daughter's around the clock. 

&#x200B;

I'm so fucking proud of us both for not only surviving but remaining sane during this whole ordeal. Can't wait to be home! Thanks for reading 🙂",33.0,10.353209775183066,33.0,0.057,0.834,0.11,0.9961,5185,0,0.5181347150259068,1.881
"Height: 5'4

Weight: 130

Gender: F

Race: White

Medications: none currently, most recent ones were risperidone and lamictal. Discontinued about six months ago due to lack of substantial results with no major emotional changes as a result.

Smoking status: vape often. About a juul pod a day.

Previous medical issues: mentioned below. Few different diagnoses over the years. ADHD first (childhood), then they added major depressive disorder (~2015). In 2018, they both got thrown out and replaced with Bipolar II. 

Duration of complaint: Always, really. I feel like it wasn't as bad in elementary school, or maybe it just wasn't something I was really bothered by/aware of. By middle/high school, it was definitely noticeable to me.

Complaint:

I consistently test above average academically. I hate even saying that, but it’s relevant to this concern. I learn easily, I understand easily, I remember LONG-term easily.

I cannot input a debit/credit card number recited to me into our work database if they don’t pause in between groups of numbers. I cannot record a last name or an unfamiliar word down if it isn’t spelled out to me both slowly and a few letters at a time. I absolutely CANNOT verbally spell, though spelling isn’t a problem at all when writing. I cannot visually interpret XYZ grids whatsoever, and I’m proficient at math. I also can’t do division or multiplication in my head. Addition/subtraction over two places is also incredibly difficult if any numbers need to be carried.

Essentially, any thinking process where I have to go past three, maybe four small steps at a time, I forget where I’m at entirely and have to start all over. It’s like my RAM is nearly non-existent. Everything I do on paper works out great because it can’t disappear- it’s permanently on the page. Anything requiring on-the-spot, short-term memory? Forget it... literally.

I have a childhood diagnosis of ADHD. Got diagnosed with major depressive disorder around 21. After a major depressive episode/suicidal issue a few years after that, my psychiatrist shifted my diagnosis/medication to bipolar II. This diagnostic shift was predicated on an event I described when I was 18, where after a traumatic life event (first major death of a loved one), I had a solid month of extremely erratic, reckless and very uncharacteristic behavior combined with a lack of sleep or need/desire for it. Fit every definition I've read of a manic episode, and the age was appropriate for symptoms to start. I haven't had one since, however. 

I stopped taking these bipolar medications around six months ago because they weren’t very effective for me in general and I felt they were making focusing on schoolwork even more difficult (caused me to feel lethargic, emotionally numb, sleepy, disinterested, etc. Common side effects.) I definitely have long-standing depression issues, but no present mania or hypomania. I occasionally get bursts of energy/feeling 'up'/overconfidence, but they usually last anywhere from 1-6 hours before they go away entirely. Never days at a time since that manic episode at 18.

I haven’t found anything that falls beneath the scope of either ADHD or bipolar to explain this. Doctors and my past mental health team sort of brushed it off in the face of treating my depression. I just want to know what this specifically is. It feels bigger than just the symptoms described. It’s like I can feel my brain hit some weird wall whenever I try to think steps or moves ahead.

Speaking of which, I’ll throw in one last example. Cannot do strategy games like chess. I just lose my future plans two imagined steps in. They can’t be recalled; they just disappear.

"I'm finally ready to share my story. It's a bit tramautic. Just an FYI myself and baby are doing great but always listen to your gut. Sorry it's so long just putting it all out there in case it may help you! 
Before any of my pregnancy journey started I had heart surgery at 6 months old for a hole that wouldn't close but have been fine since. Fairly common surgery (as far as infant heart surgeries go)
So I want to start by saying my pregnancy and delivery went smoothly. Nothing out of the ordinary.  I had a bit of morning sickness, a bit of heartburn, baby was breech for 90 percent of the pregnancy but she did flip eventually, mild swelling (it was August and very hot) and no high blood pressure until the day before I was induced (the doctor didn't need me to rush over to the hospital but definitely wanted DD out the next day just in case as it was borderline high)
We went to the hospital and I delivered a healthy baby girl who is perfect. We went home and I had read (I believe on a post here) that once you're not pregnant all your symptoms go away. I was so excited for that.... Except I still had heart burn, and slowly every day my swelling was getting worse. I had bought compression socks to use during pregnancy (never did) that I put on because the swelling in my legs became so painful. My chest was hurting but I thought it was muscle strain from labor. I had a tiny cough that was constant ever since I delivered but everyone kept saying it'll go away.
We had been at home a week and because it was late August it was HOT. I however, was freezing I turned off the AC had fuzzy socks over my compression socks, sweats and a hoodie on. I also took one of DDs blankets and wrapped it around my head. I also couldn't stop dry coughing and had taken 3 showers that day because the steam helped. 
Finally it was 11 at night and I had basically a panic attack. I told my husband I thought I should go to the ER because what if it was a cough our baby could get? I mean we were just in a hospital and she was so little! Luckily, my parents could come and pick me up so DH could stay with baby. 
We went to the ER and I was admitted (the whole time anxious because I should just go home and be with my little family not at the ER for what I thought would be bronchitis.)  I was put on oxygen and sent to get a CT scan, because when the nurse had me walk across the hall to the bathroom my oxygen dropped from the low 90s to the mid 60s...
The ER doctor couldn't believe what he was seeing. My aorta was tearing and I had a leaking valve. He initially told me that they were going to take me by ambulance to a hospital in Denver (we live a little over 200 miles away from that city)  then it changed to they we're getting a Life flight ready and I'll be going into emergency heart surgery as soon as I get there...So call your husband but don't let my blood pressure raise I had to stay calm so my heart wouldn't implode.  My dad was awesomely calm and got to walk up to the helicopter pad with me. 
My mom went to be with my daughter (8 days old at that point) and my husband made the 2 hour journey to Denver. Luckily his mom and her husband drove him since he was a bit of a mess (putting it lightly) Thank goodness for family! 
I woke up after an almost 4 hour surgery with a new mechanical valve and lots of tubes. I spent 10 days in the ICU and 3 days in a regular room. My parents drove down with DD so my husband could go be with her in the hotel room a lot. Again it takes a village. I only saw her once there and it was when I got out of the ICU. We took a nap together! She was a great motivation to get better and get out. We now are about 6 months out and doing wonderful. She's so strong and sweet and patient with me while I learn how to be a mom to her while recovering and healing. 
All this to say that if you think something feels wrong even just a cough go to your doctor right away. I'm so so so glad for modern medicine because I wouldn't be here without it.

"Hello, I am 30, F, 190 lbs. I have been vomiting almost every single day since late January 2019. I don't feel sick or nauseous when the vomiting comes. It's very sudden and very violent. If I have an empty stomach it's yellow and green mucusy foam and a lot of it. It doesn't happen at certain times of the day, it's completely random. The longest I went without vomiting was 5 days, thought it would be over but nope.

My throat hasn't stopped feeling raw and my voice has been disappearing.

The first Doctor (at a clinic) I saw laughed at me, tried to convince me I was just pregnant and told me to go home and celebrate the pregnancy without even testing that. I can guarantee you I am not, unless you can get pregnant from breathing air. Did multiple pregnancy tests at a different clinic a few days later to confirm that I am in fact, not pregnant.

In the summer I stopped eating every meal and had chicken broth and pedialyte diet, nothing changed. It doesn't matter what I eat or don't eat.

My family Doctor did a blood test and physical check up. Everything seemed fine.

A few months later, I still complained and he requested a gallbladder ultrasound. He said if the office doesn't call me for a follow up appointment that it would be normal. I haven't heard from them so I guess it was.

I am a heavy cannabis user and read up about cannabis hyperemesis syndrome so I stopped that all summer as well. Nothing changed.

I haven't lost any weight, that would of been cool at least I'd get something out of it. I quit my job because my co-workers were complaining about my frequent bathroom trips, they could hear the violent vomiting and were completely grossed out the few times I didn't make it to the bathroom and grabbed the nearest trash can. I've been unemployed for 6 months now.

A few symptoms that have recently started for the past month, since early November, my stomach gets incredibly bloated, huge and hard (one side of my belly also sticks out further, not sure if that matters). It's also random, sometimes I notice it while I'm laying in bed trying to sleep, sometimes it doesn't happen at all, also not affected by food. I've also noticed a fever at night only quite frequently lately (but I also recently got lip filler and was told I could get fevers from that) I also noticed the left side of my stomach being very hot when I touch it and sometimes I notice discomfort (not pain, it just feels odd) left side under rib area.

Past diagnosis:PCOS as a teen.Endometriosis in my 20's.Prolactinoma as a teen. Was going to have it surgically removed however a few days before surgery the surgeon called me and said he normally doesn't remove them if they're not bigger than 6mm and mine was like 5.9mm or something and he said removing it was unnecessary. Have routine MRI's every year, most recent MRI (2017) showed there wasn't even a prolactinoma anymore so there was no routine MRI in 2018.

Someone please help me I am miserable. Today I had Asian slaw for lunch (without meat and fish sauce) felt completely fine, paid, went to my car, got in my car, felt it coming and threw the car door open and left the salad in the parking lot. I don't want to eat or live anymore.

History of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type III along with a number of comorbidities, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal issues. More details on medical history at end of post.

There has been a smell coming from my pantry for the last several days that I haven’t been able to identify. Today, I opened the door and just got hit with this wall of fumes, and I decided enough was enough. I spent about half an hour tearing it apart and smelling every single thing in it. By the time I identified the potatoes and threw them out, I was feeling pretty terrible. My head kills, I’m super nauseous, and I’m having chest pains.

I looked it up online and read that rotten potato fumes can be extremely toxic, but it’s hard to tell if I’m feeling awful because of toxins or because the smell and activity triggered flares of my pre-existing conditions (see below). It’s not uncommon for me to experience chest pains just from walking around the kitchen for a while, and I have a headache and nausea for the better part of most days as it is. It feels worse than normal, but not so much worse that it couldn’t be a heightened version of the regular stuff.

That being said, I have been experiencing some other unexplained symptoms over the last few weeks that I wonder might have been caused by inhaling the fumes before they were as noticeable. I’ve been experiencing random spikes in temperature (99.6-100) that last for about 12-18 hours, go away, and then pop back up again a few days later. I’ve also lost weight (from 122 to 111 in less than a month) with no changes in diet, and I’ve had pretty bad diarrhea and abdominal pain too (mostly upper right, but it kinda moves around). I’ve also had really bad dry eyes and dry mouth. (My rheumatologist has suspected Sjogren’s for a while and ordered a lip biopsy recently, so that’s happening soon.) I also have had a sore throat (kinda burns, probably related to dry mouth) and swollen glands.

I have an unrelated diagnostic laparoscopy scheduled for next month, and they’re going to test me for covid before that. I don’t think I have covid, and neither does my doctor. Mostly because the fever has been so off-and-on, and I’ve had no cough at all. But I’ll be tested in the next few weeks regardless.

I just don’t know how to tell whether the worsened symptoms I’m experiencing should be worrying me or not. I sent a message to my doctor, but the office doesn’t open for several hours, and she probably won’t see my message until the end of the work day anyway (that’s the time of day she usually sends me messages). If there’s a chance I’m experiencing poisoning, what steps should I take to manage it until I hear from my doctor?

Health issues: EDS (type III), POTS, mitral valve prolapse, MCAS, pernicious anemia, gastroparesis, IBD, GERD, interstitial cystitis, idiopathic hypersomnolence, small fiber neuropathy, cervical instability, scoliosis, kyphosis, tortuous colon, vestibular adenitis (two past surgeries for this), and unexplained eosinophilia (pending hematology referral). Suspected esophageal dysmotility (doctor wanted to do a manometry, but I declined because it sounds awful, so this is unconfirmed). Suspected endometriosis (pending laparoscopy). Suspected Sjogren’s (pending lip biopsy).

Meds:

Ditropan (10 mg/day), Metoprolol (75 mg/day), Nexium (80 mg/day), Sunosi (150 mg/day), B12 (1000 mg/day), Nexplanon birth control implant

I have had no recent changes in meds apart from my cardiologist upping my metoprolol from 50 to 75 mg/day because I’ve been dealing with shortness of breath, presyncope, and chest pains more often than normal lately due to inactivity (thanks, quarantine).

"Disclaimer: I wanted to write this to provide information to women experiencing a diagnosis of a blighted ovum, but this is not intended to provide false hope. You have done nothing wrong with any steps that you take. Please advocate for your own health, an obtain second (or third!) opinions if you feel that it will provide you the information that you need to make the best medical decisions.


I’m not even sure if this is the correct place to post this, but when I initially received the diagnosis of a blighted ovum I was looking for actual stories and found only medical information. I don’t know, I guess I was looking for some understanding.

My husband and I have been TTC for 8.5 long years (we have one 9 year old, who was a surprise) and in that time period we only had one CP very early on. I tracked dutifully for 8 years, kept a running list of baby names on my phone, and emotionally struggled as all of my fertile-Myrtle friends and SILs had baby after baby. In December, I essentially decided that I was done. I had always wanted to adopt anyway, so we turned our focus to adoption in January. We filed our paperwork, took our online classes, and waited. In February, I made an off-hand joke to my husband that I was late - I’m always late. He responded that I should take a test, and on a whim I used the last test we had under the sink (which was actually expired). I glanced at it briefly, expecting to see a singular line as always, but this time there were two very solid lines. I immediately broke down crying in the bathroom, where my husband joined me when he saw the test. He rushed out and bought a few more, all of which solidly said that I was pregnant.

I pushed to get into our OB/GYN early, terrified it was going to be another CP. we met with our Dr. (who was actually our Dr. for our first child!) and he confirmed the pregnancy via test but was unable to locate an embryo via TV ultrasound. He estimated that I was approximately 6 weeks along, and said that the following week should show an embryo.

We returned the following week to a different OB, who had been by Dr. during several fertility screenings. She also conducted a TV ultrasound but noted that while she saw the gestational sac, it was empty. She diagnosed me with a blighted ovum, and began discussion my three options - Natural, Medical, or D&C. I was heartbroken, but chose to continue naturally and a D&C if it hadn’t started in several weeks. 

I was fairly useless in the following days, and hardly wanted to leave the couch. I took a few days from work, giving my boss minimal details. I still felt pregnant, but the OB has explained that my body was still emitting hormones that gave me the typical symptoms.

On February 25th we went in for a final ultrasound with our hospital’s radiology department to confirm the diagnosis. I watched as our technician conducted an ultrasound, and noted that her face didn’t change. She then switches to a TV ultrasound, and I closed my eyes hoping the time would pass more quickly. After a few moments though she turned the screen around and said “congratulations, you’re pregnant”. I saw our tiny embryo on the screen, measuring at only 6w4d. I saw it’s heart fluttering, and instantly burst out crying. I don’t think I will ever experience that level of emotion again. Our tech was wiping her eyes, and explained that this rarely happens (she had never experienced it herself before) but that somehow I was measuring much further behind than what my tracking would indicate.

We followed up this week with another TV ultrasound and were able to hear our baby’s heartbeat and see expected growth. My HCG levels aren’t right on par with where they should be, and I was told by the midwife that this is now a considered a viable pregnancy.

I wrote this wall of text for a few reasons. For starters, I really needed to get it out of my system and record it somewhere. And while I don’t want to give false hope to other women experiencing the same diagnosis, I felt so relieved that I hadn’t chosen to immediately terminate the pregnancy via medicine or D&C. I didn’t have even the slightest ounce of hope, but I wanted to wait and see what my body did naturally. A friend (who is an L&D RN) explained later that the tracking at the beginning is always a bit wonky, and that if my OB was looking for a 7w embryo she obviously wouldn’t have found it. If this can give even one woman some guidance, it will be worth it.",21.0,9.839116458819744,21.0,0.039,0.881,0.08,0.9875,4479,0,0.4874390701162355,0.819
"I worried about this constantly while pregnant so I figured I'd post here because I know there are others who feel now the way I felt. 

I'm 8 days out. Context: I had an easy pregnancy, physically. Emotionally, it was the hardest experience of my life. Wondering if baby would be ok (found out late at 17 weeks) shotgun wedding, personal and interpersonal upheaval.

The amount of stress and fog I felt during pregnancy overwhelmed every part of me and I worried constantly that this was the new norm and going downhill when baby arrived. Between work and endless preparation for baby, I had no time for myself (I live or die on having it).

But I've been less tired (sleep about as much), have more time (worked till day of labor now on unpaid leave), and less interpersonal stress (everyone is about baby now with a shared goal). I also have my autonomy back over my body in a significant way. I physically feel more myself and the constant mental exhaustion that I know you know was lifted after getting back home. I'm still physically recovering but things are already better.

So basically, for anyone out there as scared as I was - it might be ok on the other side. You might... and probably will! feel better. So soon. Hang in there. Pregnancy does not last forever.

"I’ve never been particularly keen on myself. Like most people there’s things I hate. There’s things I like about my life too, but that’s mostly the people. The things I like about my life are external to me.

I’m disabled and in so much physical pain all the time. I live in a crappy home we got stuck with. I’ve got a job 2+ hours away after years of shitty jobs that ruined my mental and physical health. I’ve always hated my figure and how I look. I hate aspects of my personality and my limitations. I hate some of the experiences I’ve had that broke my heart or left me with trauma. I even tried to kill myself when I was 16 and only really stayed alive after that because I knew it would be too upsetting for the people I love. 

But, on Wednesday, I got my 20 week scan. I’m giving my husband a son. And he’s huge! Top 10% for size. He’s cheeky too. I’ve been getting kicked and punched something fierce since about week 16. During each scan he’s been upside down with his bum in the air and wriggling around, making it hard to get the scans done properly. Last time I had to jump around, shake my hips, the sonographer was practically slapping my belly and eventually tilted the bed upside down so she could get the profile done. And by that point he wouldn’t stop yawning so she still couldn’t get the picture. Whole thing took 45 minutes. My mother was with me and couldn’t stop laughing and crying. 

Me and my husband suffered a really traumatic loss last year and it nearly killed me. I mean physically nearly killed me. I developed PTSD from the surgery involved. We’ve been emotionally distant (as best we can be) this whole pregnancy so far to protect ourselves from more hurt. On top of that I have a condition that causes complications and difficulties in pregnancy. But our baby is so perfectly healthy it’s like all the excitement we’ve not allowed ourselves to feel the last 4 months has caught up with us and won’t let go. 

When I was talking to my brother (who’s also my best friend) later after the scan I went to make a self-deprecating joke as I always do and stopped myself. I couldn’t do it. Saying anything negative about myself was in turn saying something  negative about my son. For the first time in my life I was so completely contented with exactly who I am because it has led me to my wonderful, unruly son in my belly. And to me that’s the most incredible thing ever. To know it’s my son growing and developing inside me. My son I’ve imagined for years and years now. The son I’ve dreamt of, who’s name I decided a long time ago, the son I sometimes never thought I’d have, but in my heart always knew I would. Knowing he exists and is growing inside me has made every trauma and heartbreak and second of ungodly pain completely worth it. I’m crying as I type this. I’ve never loved myself. But now I do, because inside me is my son, who I love more than anything else. I’ve got so much love for him in my belly it’s spilling out into the rest of me. I love me, because I love my son.

But, on Wednesday, I got my 20 week scan. I’m giving my husband a son. And he’s huge! Top 10% for size. He’s cheeky too. I’ve been getting kicked and punched something fierce since about week 16. During each scan he’s been upside down with his bum in the air and wriggling around, making it hard to get the scans done properly. Last time I had to jump around, shake my hips, the sonographer was practically slapping my belly and eventually tilted the bed upside down so she could get the profile done. And by that point he wouldn’t stop yawning so she still couldn’t get the picture. Whole thing took 45 minutes. My mother was with me and couldn’t stop laughing and crying. 

Me and my husband suffered a really traumatic loss last year and it nearly killed me. I mean physically nearly killed me. I developed PTSD from the surgery involved. We’ve been emotionally distant (as best we can be) this whole pregnancy so far to protect ourselves from more hurt. On top of that I have a condition that causes complications and difficulties in pregnancy. But our baby is so perfectly healthy it’s like all the excitement we’ve not allowed ourselves to feel the last 4 months has caught up with us and won’t let go. 

When I was talking to my brother (who’s also my best friend) later after the scan I went to make a self-deprecating joke as I always do and stopped myself. I couldn’t do it. Saying anything negative about myself was in turn saying something  negative about my son. For the first time in my life I was so completely contented with exactly who I am because it has led me to my wonderful, unruly son in my belly. And to me that’s the most incredible thing ever. To know it’s my son growing and developing inside me. My son I’ve imagined for years and years now. The son I’ve dreamt of, who’s name I decided a long time ago, the son I sometimes never thought I’d have, but in my heart always knew I would. Knowing he exists and is growing inside me has made every trauma and heartbreak and second of ungodly pain completely worth it. I’m crying as I type this. I’ve never loved myself. But now I do, because inside me is my son, who I love more than anything else. I’ve got so much love for him in my belly it’s spilling out into the rest of me. I love me, because I love my son. 

I cannot wait to meet him.",16.0,9.285846661153059,16.0,0.18,0.66,0.159,-0.954,3061,0,1.1320042764605998,2.88

"Our beautiful son, Hamish Boaz Jackson, was born this morning at 32 weeks 5 days, weighing 4 pounds 3 ounces and measuring 17"" long. He was breathing on his own at birth thanks to the steroid shots that were administered for his lungs and so far only needs minimal oxygen support and an NG tube because he hasn't mastered the suck/swallow/breathe mechanism. 

The birth story: 
I was admitted to the hospital in preterm labor earlier this week. At this time they discovered that I had masses on my ovary and one kidney, eventually diagnosed as stage 3 ovarian cancer. There was some discussion of when and how treatment would begin, whether to have a caesarean section and try to remove some of the cancer then, etc. 

On Monday morning the oncologist asked for another PET scan to determine where the cancer had spread in totality (ie, where there may be cancer cells but not enough to create visible tumors), and expressed his urgency. 

The oncologist, obstetrician, and my midwife that I've been with my whole pregnancy met with my husband and I on Monday afternoon and we discussed our options. It is extremely unlikely that I will be able to have another baby after this, so we discussed everything and they made it clear that they wanted to respect my wishes and my husband's wishes as much as possible. I asked if there was any possible way I could be induced and experience labour and delivery as naturally as possible. They all consulted together and came back and let us know that they thought that Hamish could handle it. After that everything happened remarkably quickly. 

After an NST, I was given something to prepare my cervix and hooked up to Pitocin. It took a couple of hours for everything to get going, I remember in the beginning I was laughing and joking about how this was going to be a piece of cake. By about 11:30 at night though I was experiencing intense contractions and even though the idea was to go drug free I ended up asking for nitrous oxide, which was actually amazing. I was relaxed again and able to focus on my goal and not my fears. 

At 1:30 this morning I was fully dilated and ready to push. Because of his size it only took 3 pushes and he came out! I had planned to switch to my hands and knees when it was time to push and the midwife and my husband were helping me to get there when I felt his head, I remember saying ""oh, no, nope"" and trying to push him back in with my hand, but luckily they stopped that. 

I had expected that his birth would be a somewhat sterile and medical experience given everything and had expressed my disappointment in this, and I feel like everyone tried to make it as serene, peaceful, and not ""cold"" as possible. When baby came out they let me hold him and he started crying, my husband also got to hold him for a short time. They took him up to the NICU after about 15 minutes down with us, but honestly, I was exhausted and I just told my husband ""I'm going to sleep now"" and did. Haha. 

When I woke up we were able to go up and see him. I expressed that I wanted to walk around as soon as possible and so I walked up to see him. They had him wrapped up in a cute little candy cane stripes blanket with a santa hat on his head and I cried. 

I'm back to my room now resting. My husband is on his way with some Church's chicken and beer (my requests). Most likely my PET scan will be on Thursday and we will figure out how to proceed from there.

We decided to name him Hamish Boaz; Boaz meaning ""in him is strength"". We wanted a name connotating strength and decided to go biblical in honor of his birth date. 

I need to ask my husband if sharing a photo of him  would be okay, but for now, know that he is the sweetest thing we've ever seen and I am so in love. 

There's many fears and unknowns for our family right now but I feel that I had a fantastic birth and I have a beautiful son and I couldn't ask for more.",40.0,8.872460727609733,40.0,0.041,0.82,0.14,0.9981,3925,0,0.2928362259838583,1.6400000000000001
"I'm writing up an email to send out to family members and close friends to remind them to get their flu shot since the season is starting soon. I didn't think I'd be doing this 5 years ago, but 5 years ago my MIL wasn't anti-vaxx so here we are. Would love any feedback or critiques! Thank you!  


 *Hi all!* 

*I hope you're as excited for the holidays as I am!* 

*I'm sending out an email at the request of my doctor as flu season is beginning. If you're planning on seeing me over the holidays, please get your flu shot. Pregnant people are much more susceptible to contagions because our immune system has lowered in order to accept the baby. If I catch the flu while pregnant, it can lead to dehydration, miscarriage, preterm labor, or (in extreme cases) maternal death. The flu may also cause birth or congenital defects in the baby.* 

*If you are uncomfortable with getting the flu shot, please let me know so that we don't put the baby at risk. We can schedule a video call instead!*

*Thank you for joining me in keeping my first baby as safe as possible!*

"When my daughter had her 2 month shots (DTAP-IPV-HIB, and prevnar) years ago, she had a bad reaction. I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere. And I dont think our healthcare staff handled it appropriately looking back. She had a high pitched wail for hours on end between deep deep sleeps, labored breathing, fever, and was very lethargic (no eye contact) and wouldnt feed well. The nurse said I was being a worried first time mother, over the phone and said she was fine. I literally watched her 24/7 until about 3 days later she started to come around. In my reading I found that DTAP can be a little harder than prevnar or MenC vaccines, so at the next visit I skipped DTAP and did those. She did not even react to those 2 vaccines. After this I just stopped. (I know I know) 

Before all this happened I was very pro-vaccine. I used to be a quality control chemist for a pharmaceutical manufacturer and even dabbled in R&D. Let me also add that I am very auto-immune. To the point of almost dying twice. I have also had rare reactions to medications like drug induced lupus to remicade and anaphylaxis to codeine. I am allergic to several medications and antibiotics. Big pharma products have hurt me, but they have also saved my life. Being in and out of hospitals I have seen the good and the bad in the healthcare system. Currently I am in 100% remission thanks to stelara. 

And I have never been sure of my decision to stop shots and I have been relying on herd immunity while I figure it out. I want to protect her, but I also fear that she will become autoimmune.

All this said I have made an appointment to have her first shot in years and she will be getting MMRV at the age of 12. If all goes well I will restart her DTAP-IPV series. The nurse was very kind and helpful and even angry for how I was treated. She says she understands my fear and will go at my own pace.

My wife’s water broke on Friday November 8th and we were discharged with instructions to monitor for any signs of infection or labor or any changes in discharge. 

On Saturday we had a nervous day of laying in bed and watching lots of Scrubs. Late in the afternoon my wife noticed some shooting abdominal pain and dull lower back pain so we called the perinatal doctor we spoke to the day before and she recommended we take a trip to the hospital to be evaluated. We had a nervous trip down to the hospital and were hooked to the monitor and the nurse was able to find both heartbeats and we were immediately relieved. They took an ultrasound and everything looked ok, in fact baby A appeared to have accumulated some fluid since the day before which was a good sign. We were discharged again but felt like we might be ok. 

On Monday morning my wife woke up to a pink discharge which we called in to L&D and they told us to come in for another evaluation. This time our drive to the hospital was less nervous and more scared. We were hooked to the monitor and they searched for baby A’s heart for a few minutes without luck. They pinned down baby B and went back to searching for baby A. A few more minutes and another nurse came in to try. Our hearts were falling but we still didn’t know for sure. When the doctor came in with the ultrasound she found baby A and her heart was still. A second doctor came in to confirm the diagnosis. One of our twins had died in the womb. 

Monday we were 23 weeks exactly and we were admitted. The hospital has a Level 3 NICU so we were where we needed to be. At this point my wife still had no signs of preterm labor. No contractions. We were counseled by neonatology about outcomes for babies born at 23 weeks in case my wife went into labor or in case they needed to do an emergency c-section. After having just lost baby A, we were willing to do anything to keep baby B and opted to agree to all resuscitative measures in case they were needed. 

My wife began on the antibiotics and received her first round of steroids. We were absolutely crushed by the loss of baby A. My wife lost her father earlier this year and it has felt like a series of losses have struck us in a row. We spent our first night in the hospital scared for baby B and mourning the loss of baby A. The course of action at this point was to keep monitoring for signs of infection, keep tabs on mom’s and baby’s vitals, and watch for any symptoms of labor. 

We woke up early Tuesday morning to cramps that felt like period cramps. We knew that at this gestational age contractions can be fairly light so we got hooked back into the monitor and my wife was given Tylenol and iv fluids. The cramps subsided. 

In the morning we celebrated being pregnant another day. My wife had a bowel movement and noticed something protruding from her vagina, it was baby A’s foot. My wife had an unmedicated vaginal delivery of baby A without contractions or labor. Baby B stayed inside. We got to hold our baby girl and give her a name. We got to say goodbye. We named her Chioma. My wife was a rockstar but I crumbled holding her tiny body. They sutured the umbilical cord as close to the cervix as possible and noted that the cervix had closed after delivery. 

Since then it has been back to the waiting game. Grieving for Chioma. Grieving the unfulfilled plans and dreams of raising twin little girls. But also celebrating the life still within my wife. Hopeful but terrified. Today marks 24 weeks and 6 days. Every day is a gift and every day improves baby B’s chances.

We have good days and bad. We have a lot of visitors, we have used redbox more in the last two weeks then the last two years. 

It’s a very strange emotional mix, the sadness, the anger, the happiness, the fear. It’s very strange that the best outcome at this point is a long protracted hospital stay followed by a short NICU stay for Baby B. 

Thank you for the support we received when I first posted about the membrane rupture. This is an amazing and supportive community. Our nurses and our doctors have been incredible and have provided excellent care. 

We’re still here, counting days and hoping and praying for positive outcomes.",10.0,10.20505821084484,10.0,0.114,0.756,0.13,0.9697,4332,0,0.8768556264902699,1.1400000000000001

It’s a very strange emotional mix, the sadness, the anger, the happiness, the fear. It’s very strange that the best outcome at this point is a long protracted hospital stay followed by a short NICU stay for Baby B. 

Thank you for the support we received when I first posted about the membrane rupture. This is an amazing and supportive community. Our nurses and our doctors have been incredible and have provided excellent care. 

We’re still here, counting days and hoping and praying for positive outcomes.",38.0,9.64812425416978,38.0,0.114,0.756,0.13,0.9697,4332,0,0.8768556264902699,4.332
"Hi,  I just wanted to share this since I'm seeing so many other posts about depression and anxiety during pregnancy.  My psychiatrist actually told me that 1 in 5 mothers experience it.

I have been on prozac for years and xanex as needed. I was on 30mg of prozac when I got pregnant.  I took the xanex (.25mg) around 4 times a year.  Before getting pregnant,  my OB said it was OK to stay on the prozac. 

I desperately wanted to get pregnant. I work with children and had dreamed of being a mother my whole life. My husband and I went through 2 painful years of trying to conceive,  and I was over the moon when my second cycle of IUI worked. 

Around 5 weeks,  something changed.  I felt sicker than I had in my life.  I cried constantly.  I stayed in bed shaking from panic attacks. Xanex was a no go for pregnancy but I took it once after spending the night thinking about killing myself. I asked my husband to disassemble our gun.  I hoped that I would miscarry and hated myself. Within days of feeling like this,  I went to my psychiatrist and told him everything I was feeling. He upped my dosage to 40mg but when I told him about my thoughts, he said, ""you dont really mean that. "" He reminded me to feel lucky to be having a baby and to stay positive. 

A week later,  my husband was close to committing me to a psychiatric ward.  He took off of work and I would literary cling to him and cry when he left the room.

Luckily,  after my husband yelled at my psychiatrist,  we managed to get a referral to a maternal psychiatrist. My husband flipped out when he read the referral letter that said. ""ISureDoLoveCheese is so excited to be pregnant and is very happy but wants somebody who specializes in women's issues."" My husband is incredible. He made countless phone calls, and was incredibly firm and I had an appointment in 2 days.

I spent my appointment dry heaving and crying and told my new doctor everything.  And my God, she was amazing.  She didn't treat me like a human incubator.  She didn't make me feel like a terrible person. After explaining costs and benefits of meds vs anxiety attacks, she upped my prozac to 60mg, put me on zofran, and told me to take  .5mg of Ativan until the higher dosage kicked in, and then as needed  

I only needed to take the Ativan for 3 days and have not needed to since. I'm currently 26 weeks and expecting a son, who I fell in love with as soon as i saw his face on the ultrasound. 

Within THREE DAYS, I was ok again.  I was laughing. I was back at work.  I still felt sick but it didn't scare me anymore.  I was having sex again.  I was eating.  I was me. 

I'm still dealing with guilt for my thoughts during 6 to 7 weeks, but I'm otherwise ok. I'm scared of postpartum depression,  but I've been able to share those fears with a kind,  compassionate doctor who assures me that I will be closely monitored and medicated. 

I'm still scared of having a panic attack during labor, but finally have medical professionals who take that fear seriously. 

All it took was 3 days to be myself again. I love my job. My husband and I still stay up too late because we can't stop talking to each other and laughing. We went on a babymoon and I'm looking forward to my shower. My son is looking healthy and active.  

PLEASE be open to medication and push for your mental health. Please message me if you need help. 

And if somebody could reassure me about labor and postpartum,  that would be great!",27.0,8.974523625696756,27.0,0.118,0.729,0.154,0.987,3478,0,0.7661840140250632,3.186

"My little lady was born 4/11 at 2:50am at 34+5 weeks. As a background other than a few weeks of somewhat mild morning sickness the first few weeks, my pregnancy was a breeze. Until the last week.  So starting Monday of the last week i started to have off & on back pains. It was sporadic & didn't hurt at all in the front, so of course I tried to justify it as anything other than labor. I thought maybe it was spasms, maybe I was constipated, some days it hurt, other days i was totally fine. Then Friday rolled around. So for a few hours Friday morning I was having timeable conractions. They were about 10 mins apart, irregular, not super painful, & I was working so I was still able to talk through them. Since I work from home I was able to take a hot shower & they all but stopped in the afternoon. By Friday night I felt better than I had all week. I had no pain at all. By midnight I was laying in bed & sometime around 12:15 the contractions started again. They were instantly about a min long & 5 mins apart. Around 12:35 my water broke. At this point i was going back & forth from my bed to the toilet. I already had a pad on, so when my water broke i thought well either my water broke or I lost all control of my bladder, since the pad was soaked through. And that's exactly what I went to tell my husband. Lol. So after that my contractions got way worse. I was a moaning screaming mess. At 12:55 I called the doctor's office. My husband convinced me to start packing a bag. (Looking back I was definitely in denial of how far along I was.)  My husband told me later that I got so bad that he wasn't sure whether to pull up the car, or put down a towel in the bathroom. So, we get a call from the dr & head in. At this point I can barely sit & I'm screaming like a crazy person. I know during 1 contaction I screamed ""Omg I'm not going to make it!"" So, I get checked into triage at 1:35. Since my husband couldn't come up yet I could barely get changed & the nurse had to help with some of it. The dr comes in & checks me & told me I'm fully dialated. To which I thought there's no f-ing way. So as I'm being rolled to the delivery room i call my husband to get up here & i ask the nurse for an epidural or something, to which she said, ""oh sweetie, there's no time for that.""  So i get to the room & they tell me to push. I never felt the urge to push, which is probably good b/c idk where she would have been born if I had. So initially pushing felt good compared to screaming during contractions. But then the ring of fire hit & it took me a long time to make more progress. I finally pushed her out at 2:50. I didn't have any tearing & just 1 hemroid. She was 4 lbs 3 ozs. There was a whole NICU team that was waiting for her. They examed her & I was able to hold her for about 30 secs before they took her to the NICU. My recovery was great, my throat hurt worse than anything for the 1st day.  

My little nugget is still in the NICU, but she's doing well.  I wanted to add that you really don't need to bring anything to the hospital other than a phone charger & maybe a pair of sweatpants. I didn't bring any toiletries, but they gave me all that stuff.i wore my gown & my PJ pants I wore to the hospital the whole time.",26.0,9.02316050281254,26.0,0.099,0.825,0.077,-0.9262,3244,0,1.2855473315153878,2.5740000000000003
"I really appreciated reading all the stories that other people were willing to share so I figured it's my turn to ""pay it forward."" Happy to answer any questions for anyone.

Around 6 pm on Thursday 2/27 (36w4d) I was sitting on the couch putting on my shoes to do an exercise video on youtube.  I’d been pretty active prepregnancy and tried to continue that during pregnancy but I definitely slowed down toward the end.  After I put on one shoe I felt a gush of fluid and told my husband that I thought I might’ve peed! I went to put a pad on (with one shoe on!) and sure enough, fluid kept coming out.  It was very slightly tinged with blood. We called the L&D advice line and they said if I thought my water broke I should come in to get checked out. We wrapped up some stuff around the house and got to the hospital around 7pm.  I sat on a towel in the car and by the time we got to the hospital the towel was pretty soaked. The on-call obstetrician checked me and confirmed that my water had broken and said I was 3cm dilated and baby was at -3 station.

They moved me to a delivery room and the waiting began.  Contractions began to really ramp up and around 11:30pm I asked for an epidural.  I was 4cm dilated at that time. After the epidural, I was able to sleep for about 2.5 hours in total.  Around 4 am I woke up and I couldn’t hear baby’s heartbeat on the monitor but it turned out he’d moved down so the monitor just needed to be repositioned -- all was fine. 

The nurse checked me and said I was fully dilated and it was almost time to push.  I didn’t start pushing until 8:10 am. I wasn’t sure if having a mirror to see my pushing would freak me out but I actually found it really interesting and it gave me something to focus on.  I pushed and pushed, on my back and on each side, and felt like I was making no progress but the nurse assured me that he was indeed moving down the birth canal. A few hours in, they said baby’s heartrate was dropping during contractions so I had to wear an oxygen mask between contractions.  I had a button I could use to give myself an extra “push” of epidural. WIthout the extra “push” I could accurately tell the nurses when a contraction was coming before the monitor detected it. With the extra “push” I couldn’t feel it at all and had to rely on them to tell me based on the monitor.  

After about 3.5 hours of pushing I was exhausted and basically had a meltdown.  At that point there were a couple of nurses and a midwife in the room and without question they seamlessly cleaned up and left the room to give me a break.  When they came back 20 minutes later I was ready to keep pushing. The obstetrician suggested I get some pitocin to help intensify the contractions and I agreed.  She also asked if we’d consider a vacuum-assisted delivery and we agreed. The problem was that baby’s head was sideways and not fitting past my pubic bone. The vacuum lost suction and popped off one time, but finally at 1:24 pm, after almost five hours of pushing, he was born!  Despite being over three weeks early, he weighed a hefty 7 lb 11 oz. We’d actually just had a routine checkup four days before he was born and based on that ultrasound he was only a bit over 6 lbs. I can’t imagine if he’d waited until full term to make his appearance!   

Because he was premature they wanted NICU staff in the room when he was born so there were probably 8-10 medical staff in the room when he was actually born.  They put him on my stomach and vigorously rubbed him to make him cry, then quickly took him to a warming bed to check him more thoroughly. After only a few minutes the NICU staff left which was a really good sign -- he was healthy! I had no external tears, only small internal tears that needed three stitches in total. After a few hours we moved to a recovery room.  We stayed for two nights after his birth because he was premature, but he was healthy enough that he stayed in the room with us the entire time. 

The recovery has not been as bad as I thought it would be. Maybe I hyped the whole thing up in my head. As of now, a week postpartum, my pain is greatly reduced and I can walk and get up and down from sitting and laying positions easily.  Breastfeeding has gotten easier as we have both learned how to work together. I’m only about 10 lbs above my prepregnancy weight now. As of my last pregnancy weigh-in, I’d gained about 36 pounds (but that was when I was admitted when my water broke, weighed with clothes, sweater, and shoes, so I suspect it might’ve been less).  I’ve had no negative effects from the epidural. My husband has been super supportive -- I feel really pampered at home. In retrospect I actually wonder if I should’ve seen warning signs that he was coming early. For the week before his arrival I started feeling a huge increase in pelvic pressure and discomfort when walking. The day my water broke I was going to run an errand on the way home from work but I had this overwhelming feeling of needing to get home, so I skipped the errand.  Who knows!

My wife’s water broke on Friday November 8th and we were discharged with instructions to monitor for any signs of infection or labor or any changes in discharge. 

On Saturday we had a nervous day of laying in bed and watching lots of Scrubs. Late in the afternoon my wife noticed some shooting abdominal pain and dull lower back pain so we called the perinatal doctor we spoke to the day before and she recommended we take a trip to the hospital to be evaluated. We had a nervous trip down to the hospital and were hooked to the monitor and the nurse was able to find both heartbeats and we were immediately relieved. They took an ultrasound and everything looked ok, in fact baby A appeared to have accumulated some fluid since the day before which was a good sign. We were discharged again but felt like we might be ok. 

On Monday morning my wife woke up to a pink discharge which we called in to L&D and they told us to come in for another evaluation. This time our drive to the hospital was less nervous and more scared. We were hooked to the monitor and they searched for baby A’s heart for a few minutes without luck. They pinned down baby B and went back to searching for baby A. A few more minutes and another nurse came in to try. Our hearts were falling but we still didn’t know for sure. When the doctor came in with the ultrasound she found baby A and her heart was still. A second doctor came in to confirm the diagnosis. One of our twins had died in the womb. 

Monday we were 23 weeks exactly and we were admitted. The hospital has a Level 3 NICU so we were where we needed to be. At this point my wife still had no signs of preterm labor. No contractions. We were counseled by neonatology about outcomes for babies born at 23 weeks in case my wife went into labor or in case they needed to do an emergency c-section. After having just lost baby A, we were willing to do anything to keep baby B and opted to agree to all resuscitative measures in case they were needed. 

My wife began on the antibiotics and received her first round of steroids. We were absolutely crushed by the loss of baby A. My wife lost her father earlier this year and it has felt like a series of losses have struck us in a row. We spent our first night in the hospital scared for baby B and mourning the loss of baby A. The course of action at this point was to keep monitoring for signs of infection, keep tabs on mom’s and baby’s vitals, and watch for any symptoms of labor. 

We woke up early Tuesday morning to cramps that felt like period cramps. We knew that at this gestational age contractions can be fairly light so we got hooked back into the monitor and my wife was given Tylenol and iv fluids. The cramps subsided. 

In the morning we celebrated being pregnant another day. My wife had a bowel movement and noticed something protruding from her vagina, it was baby A’s foot. My wife had an unmedicated vaginal delivery of baby A without contractions or labor. Baby B stayed inside. We got to hold our baby girl and give her a name. We got to say goodbye. We named her Chioma. My wife was a rockstar but I crumbled holding her tiny body. They sutured the umbilical cord as close to the cervix as possible and noted that the cervix had closed after delivery. 

Since then it has been back to the waiting game. Grieving for Chioma. Grieving the unfulfilled plans and dreams of raising twin little girls. But also celebrating the life still within my wife. Hopeful but terrified. Today marks 24 weeks and 6 days. Every day is a gift and every day improves baby B’s chances.

"Brief overview of what brought us here. My wife was pregnant with spontaneous di/di twins, due March 9, 2020. On November 8, Twin A/Chioma's water broke. On November 11, we went into the hospital for an evaluation and found out that her heart had stopped. Her sister, Kelenna, was still alive with intact membranes. My wife was admitted and on November 12, delivered Chioma naturally. During our hospital stay we were receiving NSTs three times a day. I'm a bit fuzzy on when the first significant decel happened, but it was around the weekend of December 7. We were put on constant monitoring with the hope that it was an isolated incident and we could go back to three times daily if we had a clean trace until the next morning. Instead we began almost a week of constant monitoring and late night decels that Kelenna always recovered from, but had the perinatal team asking when she would decel and not recover that would necessitate an emergency c-section. (Kelenna was breach throughout this period.)

Early in the morning of December 12, we had multiple decels including at least one that necessitated my wife to be put on NPO and to start on magnesium. Our resident came by during rounds and told me I should not go in to work that day. When the perinatologist came in, she highly recommended that we move forward with an urgent scheduled, but not emergency c-section. We cried over the decision but ultimately agreed that this was our daughter telling us that she was ready to make her grand entrance and that we should listen to our doctors. She would be born at 27+3 gestational age; a month to the day that her twin sister was born. The c-section was scheduled for 10 AM and our daughter was born at 10:30.

We heard her crying before we saw her during the ""drive-by"" on her way to the isolette. The NICU team stabilized her and she scored an 8 on the Apgar at 5 minutes. 

In the intervening weeks, my wife has recovered from her surgery remarkably well. She was discharged 5 days after delivery, but if we hadn't spent the last month in L&D it probably would have been sooner. We got into the housing for family members with loved ones in the hospital which has been absolutely huge for helping us adjust to our new life as NICU parents.

Kelenna is doing great, she is taking full feeds and gaining weight, she's been on bubble CPAP of 4-5 since day 4 or so. I'm convinced NICU life is harder on us the parents than it is on her. In addition to the stress of having a loved one in the hospital for the foreseeable future, we have also been grieving over multiple losses. Of her sister's life of course, but also of our chance to be parents of twins. Of getting to see her grow up with a twin sister, to see how they were the same and how they were different. We are also grieving the loss of a normal third trimester and having a baby in the hospital.

My heart swells with joy every time I see her, and it breaks every time we have to leave.

We've been doing normal parent things, changing diapers, taking temperatures and giving baths. Waking up twice a night to pump, and being exhausted throughout the day. Mama loves the skin to skin; she bradied twice on me my first time holding her, so I'm waiting until she's a little more stable to do it again.

"Brief overview of what brought us here. My wife was pregnant with spontaneous di/di twins, due March 9, 2020. On November 8, Twin A/Chioma's water broke. On November 11, we went into the hospital for an evaluation and found out that her heart had stopped. Her sister, Kelenna, was still alive with intact membranes. My wife was admitted and on November 12, delivered Chioma naturally. During our hospital stay we were receiving NSTs three times a day. I'm a bit fuzzy on when the first significant decel happened, but it was around the weekend of December 7. We were put on constant monitoring with the hope that it was an isolated incident and we could go back to three times daily if we had a clean trace until the next morning. Instead we began almost a week of constant monitoring and late night decels that Kelenna always recovered from, but had the perinatal team asking when she would decel and not recover that would necessitate an emergency c-section. (Kelenna was breach throughout this period.)

Early in the morning of December 12, we had multiple decels including at least one that necessitated my wife to be put on NPO and to start on magnesium.

"A cousin we haven’t seen in years asked to come to Thanksgiving, and we didn’t reject her. We also wanted to meet her baby.

"This isn't a full birth story because I have slept about 4 hours in 36 hours, but I just needed somewhere to word dump and process some of what has happened in the past few days. Quick backstory, I had been having early labor symptoms for a few weeks, pulled off work for being dilated 2.5 cm at 33 weeks. Well at 34 weeks and 4 days, body went into labor and despite all interventions could not stop that labor. I had my baby boy yesterday at 4:17 pm. He is currently in the NICU because his lungs are not fully developed at his gestational age. Luckily, he was still 6 lbs 2 oz and has a decent layer of fat on him. He's only on 6 L hi flow nasal cannula, but oxygen looks great. I'm hoping for a speedy discharge, but nicu can be one step forward 2 steps back.

This is my second baby and my first had an easy delivery, easy recovery, and my baby and I bonded instantly. This round was hard, they let me hold him for about 30 seconds after pushing him out (thank goodness he was breathing okay and not in distress).  Then they had to whisk him away to nicu to get him settled with oxygen, a feeding tube, some IVs etc. Well I started to have a bit if a breakdown once I got to my room. A tiny tiny old room in the hospital. I don't get to be in a larger nicer room because I don't have a bassinet and I don't have my baby with me because he is in the nicu. I finally got to visit and hold him at 10:30 pm. After that I could finally get a little bit of sleep until the postpartum cramps settled in. Those things are no joke, especially for round 2. I hate pain meds but took a percocet because it was so bad. Walking around helps too. FTMs, just be aware of those cramps, they hurt.

I feel lost with having my baby in the nicu. Luckily, he is late preterm and those babies do well usually and only have a 1-3 week stay, but things can always go wrong. I also miss my first born and my dogs. I want to go home because my main job now is to just pump. Then I feel like a bad mom because I should want to stay here, near my new little guy. What I hope is that tomorrow morning will bring some clarity and peace to the situation. I know this will just be a blip in his whole life and will not effect our bonding,  but it sure does feel like it now at 4 am after not sleeping for days. 

I am grateful for the OB that was on call during my entire labor process. I delivered 40 minutes before she was off call and she had just come on call when I was in triage. She discussed how normal it is for moms to have increased depression and anxiety with having a baby in nicu and not getting to go home with them. I'm also grateful for the nurses that took care of me and the ones taking care of my baby right now. 

Sorry for the rambling post. I just needed to word dump somewhere to help process.",18.0,8.218542238479598,18.0,0.078,0.761,0.16,0.9953,2799,0,0.48746953315417785,1.404
"I have insulin dependent GD and have had twice weekly BPPs, once with my OB and once with my MFM, since 32 weeks. I’m 34+6 today. I’ve also had a hellishly difficult pregnancy. You can check my history for more details but long story short: horrible HG since the start, GD diagnosed at 20 weeks that has been difficult to control, irritable uterus, polyhydramnios, pinched nerves leading to constant back and arm pain and numbness, 2 cholestasis scares, etc. At this point at almost 35 weeks, I am in so much pain all the time that I can’t even stand to make my 2 year old son a snack without almost crying, but I also can’t sit comfortably. I’m on 138 units of long acting insulin spread across 3 shots a day, a Zofran pump, correction insulin for highs. 

My baby has been measuring large, especially her abdomen. I have 32cm of fluid. I’ve been crying all the time, because this shitshow pregnancy is making me depressed. My psychiatrist agrees it’s the pregnancy and the only real remedy is to deliver. ACOG guidelines for poorly controlled GD are delivery late preterm to early term - so 34-38 weeks. I’m currently scheduled for 38 weeks but decided to broach the topic of moving delivery to 37 weeks with MFM today. 

She declined to move it forward. Which, fine, okay, I was disappointed obviously and I started crying. But then the fucked up comments came. First she said she wouldn’t do it because even though 99% of 37 weekers are fine, if my baby isn’t I will sue her. She also constantly referred to me wanting to be delivered now which isn’t what I was asking for and told me I’d have a baby with a lot of issues. 

The two most enraging comments though were these: 
“You already have one autistic child (my 2 year old son is autistic), do you want another one?” (Wtf early term birth doesn’t cause autism and my son is amazing fuck you) 
“‘Maybe baby will have another bad BPP and we will have to deliver before then.” (So basically “hey maybe baby will go into distress and we will have to deliver her to prevent her from dying!”)

I’ve told my bumper group (I’m still in the one from my son) and they all think I need to file a complaint. Every time I think about the conversation I start crying from rage. I have to see an MFM for the remainder of the pregnancy but I don’t want to see her again.

"I deal with this often especially among people who already have living kids, and people who are further in their pregnancies than I am.  Maybe I'm just being too sensitive, but it's an IVF pregnancy so I am on a lot of drugs that probably make my emotions a lot worse!

Because I did IVF, I know the baby is a boy because I know what his chromosomes are. (It was PGS tested.)  I mistakenly referred to the embryo as ""he"" a couple times before it was even transferred into my uterus, and I felt incredibly embarrassed!  But since my BFP and beta (I'm 7+3) I feel a lot more comfortable saying ""he.""  After all, if I found out the gender at 15 weeks, I'd be saying ""he"" and the only reason most people don't do it at 7 weeks it that most people don't know it's a he! But every time I refer to it as ""he"" by accident, outside of my immediate family, people laugh at me, like even though I know the sex it's for some reason too early to refer to it.

I keep hearing dismissive comments (not on here) about how:

* There's no way you have symptoms, most people at your point don't even know they're pregnant (Really? Most people have missed a period for several weeks before taking a test? Most non-IVF pregnancies I see find out before 7 weeks, often in the 4-5w range)
* You don't know if this pregnancy is going to last anyway, it's so early (Thanks so much for fucking reminding me, I only worry about this, um...EVERY DAMN DAY) On that note though, at least we've done the PGS testing so I have more clarity about genetics at 7 weeks than most people do.
* It's too early for you to be getting ultrasounds, I didn't even get a blood test, I didn't get my ultrasound until 12 weeks (congrats!  It's an IVF PREGNANCY!  We get our ultrasounds before the baby is even in there, let alone after!!)
* Generally mocking/laughing about the idea that I could already feel connected to my pregnancy.  Excuse me but really?? I felt connected before I was even pregnant because I ""conceived"" this baby 6 months ago in a lab.  IVF parents *are* connected to their embryos.  My husband is the same way!  
* Just you wait, if you think the anxiety is bad now. (Yeah, I'm sure parenting in general is anxiety-provoking, but right now I have a much higher risk of loss than I'll have at 39 weeks so yeah, I'm going to be more worried about MC now.  I love this this line is juxtaposed with ""It's too early and you could lose it.""  So I should acknowledge I could have a loss, and...not care?)

I thought once I was pregnant, I would feel like part of the club, but I feel like I'm repeatedly reminded that I don't really count because I'm not pregnant enough.  How far along must I be before I'm allowed to have feelings?

Anyone else experience or used to experience this?

This year started off shaky and full of drama and tears. 2020, I will never forget watching the ball drop through tears at Toronto Mount Sinai Triage on the Maternity floor on a tiny little screen.

Little did I know, I wasn't going to see myself back home anytime soon after the NYE.

After the sad ball drop moment, our life turned upside down yet again. We learned yet another medical term. pPROM. Preterm Premature Rupture of Membrane. This basically means the membrane around the baby rips a tiny bit and the amnio fluid leaks out. This leaves the baby dry and open to infection. Dangerous situation.

"About 3 hours ago I found out that we are expecting our baby girl sometime in the next day or so. My wife developed high blood pressure about 3 weeks ago. For the past two days she's been in the Labor and Delivery ER trying to regulate her blood pressure. They gave her steroids for the babies lungs. She visited her baby shower via iPad/Facetime yesterday. I went and opened gifts, got my belly measured and wore the Mommy To Be sash as a representative. They told us this morning that they are going to induce, we just had breakfast and I am reading up on what to expect from a 32 week delivery. She had her Cervidil put in a couple hours ago.

I had my scheduled c-section Wednesday morning , with time of birth at 07:01 cst. It was rushed because LO had no variability in his heart rate. Nurse and OB used their non-alarmist way of saying “LO needs to come out!” by saying, “Well, you’re having a baby this morning.” It was Deja Vú to my first born’s delivery. 


I was quickly prepped for the c-section and before I knew it LO was out. But he didn’t cry. His cord was abnormally thin and tightly wrapped around his ankle. LO’s doctor and my OB’s colleague were tending to him and were telling me that LO had pooped in uterine and they were concerned about his oxygen levels. The cord blood was measuring a bit too acidic. LO was rushed over to the nursery for more tests and a better evaluation while I was closed up. 


Once we were back in the recovery room, LO’s doctor came in and gave us an update. LO was going to be medivacced to Oklahoma University’s Children’s Hospital and going into the NICU. It’s better staffed and has all the proper equipment and specialists for LO. As more labs and tests were done on LO we were told that his O2 stats were too low and white blood cell count was too high. After testing his cord they determined that LO had suffered some sort of injury in the last 48 hours that effected the amount of oxygen going to his brain and there was damage. They’re giving LO 3 days of a cooling procedure to help with any inflammation and to prevent any further injury as well as treating him with antibiotics to address any infection he may have. He’ll more than likely be in the NICU for a week or more. 


My OB is considered one of the best in the state and is very highly respected in her field. For all her experience, she doesn’t know what could have caused the initial injury. LO had been moving just fine,  even last night. The only change in anything was that yesterday I was so tired that I was constantly dozing off while sitting on the couch, as well as being unable to sleep Sunday and Monday night due to what I had assumed was nesting. When she came up to me and touched me on the shoulder, I 100% expected her to tell me LO had died/was brain dead. LO’s doctor is also very stoic and even hurt by his condition. My doctor is convinced had I come in even just a day later I’d have had a stillbirth.


I can’t help but feel ashamed that I did something to cause this. That my own stubbornness and nesting urges have caused so much hurt in my family. There are 4 sets of grandparents and they’re all emotional wrecks. My dad doesn’t cry, I’m 35 and have seen the man cry one other time. I could hear him choking up and stumbling when I spoke with him. I’ll never forget that sound for the rest of my life. I’m not letting myself process this emotionally because I have to keep myself ready to hear the worst news, that this brain damage is severe and he’ll never recover. That he’s a vegetable on life support. I had my tubes tied before I was stitched up and now I’ve made a huge mistake. That this is my punishment for the 5 or 6 bowls of pot I smoked during the pregnancy on days my anxiety felt like a heart attack. And the worst: that I don’t deserve him and it’s for the best...

I never heard him cry. I hope all you other Covid-19 mommas will give your LO’s a big hug for me.

Our son Cayden was born the begging of October at 28 weeks. He got NEC at 2 weeks old and had surgery to removed 1/3 of his small intestine. He’s since had three more reoccurrences  of NEC which his team of doctors say they have not even heard of before so he has been watched closely for good reason. He’s needed three more abdominal surgeries to fix strictures and other things related to NEC. The neo team told us to expect him home in the next two weeks. He will be coming home on TPN and his gtube on continuous. Does anyone have any advice on making the transition ? Any helpful products any advice is welcome!,1.0,5.984786599148968,1.0,0.0,0.927,0.073,0.8398,616,1,0.0,0.0

"Hi everyone - former NICU mom when our daughter that was born at 34w0d after I had severe preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and a whole host of other issues. Our daughter spent 21 days in the NICU due to bradys/desats and feeding issues. By far, the end of my pregnancy (which included a 3+ week hospital stay) and her NICU journey was the most difficult period of my life. Looking back, I can honestly say I was in a bad depression.

However, she’s been the absolute best baby/toddler. My husband and I always assumed we would have at least two children, but the experience we went through made us strongly consider being one and done. Both of us are very worried about the possibility of repeating the same issues in a second pregnancy or having a worse outcome. Prior to pregnancy, I was an average, healthy person but I find my health still recovering even 2 years later. 

I’ve seen two doctors to discuss a second pregnancy and I wasn’t thrilled with the conversations. Both told me that a second pregnancy “shouldn’t” be life-threatening again because they’ll be able to monitor and medicate any issues ahead of time. The first MFM doctor was very rude, cold and said that a NICU stay isn’t that bad because “they’re great babysitters and you get to sleep at home while they care for the baby.” The second doctor was much more compassionate and said that the pregnancy could be managed but I needed to consider my own feelings and experiences.

Just looking for general advice from those who had a NICU baby and health issues but decided to have a second. 

TL:dr I had a very difficult first pregnancy that was life-threatening and resulted in a NICU stay. I’m considering having a second child and want some advice.",20.0,7.4921333374650185,20.0,0.083,0.828,0.089,0.4981,1733,0,0.9324794966857658,1.6600000000000001
"I’m only 19w3d today and my amniotic fluid started leaking. Baby is doing fine inside, but I’m waiting on labs to check for infection. 
It seems very daunting and improbable that he will survive long enough, but if he does, he will be a micro premie and have a long road at the NICU. 

Does anyone have any good advice or resources? When I searched for preterm stuff on reddit, everything pointed to this sub. 
Obviously I’m in close take with doctors and specialists. I suppose I’m just looking for other people to find comfort in. 

Thanks.",6.0,5.714039284191424,6.0,0.0,0.883,0.117,0.9072,548,1,0.0,0.0
"Hi All, I've been lurking since my wife got pregnant and we learned it would be a possibility of having a premie due to some underlying health conditions my wife has, previous losses, and a unicornuate uterus. 

Quick Side Bar: while our baby girl is our first born, we also have a 3 year old foster daughter who is currently on the track for adoption (by us). 

Now, here's how our newest and first bio-daughter wound up in the NICU:

My wife had been having a few slightly higher BP readings the few couple of weeks and an elevated protein/creatine ratio. The OBs weren't initially concerned about all that because it was closer but not to the level of preeclampsia yet. Then she started getting daily headaches and more feet/hand swelling than usual up to this point.

In subsequent appointments she had urine dips and they all came back negative for protein but the headaches and swelling would not go away. So at her MFM appt on Tuesday the 28th the doctor took one look at her and said right away he had a cure for her, labor and delivery. Baby was laying transverse and the cord was in front of the cervix, so he said she would need to have a cesarian, but he was going to defer to L&D so he sent us down to get checked out.

After 24 hours of trying to get her headache and blood pressure under control, to no avail, the OBs determined the safest thing would be to deliver. There wasn't any benefit to keeping baby in because with pre-e she wasn't going to thrive. After a few more hours of debate on induction vs cesarian -- because the cord may have moved? spoiler alert it didn't -- they finally took us in for the cesarian and our daughter was born at 2:41pm on the 29th. 

My wife got to see her briefly before they took baby to the NICU. Wife was then confined to her bed for 24hrs due to being on magnesium so I followed and stayed with baby girl for a bit until my wife was out of recovery.

**Now - on to baby and NICU the last few days**

Baby was 5lbs 4oz at birth which I was very surprised about. But then again, she was doing perfectly fine before the pre-e set in. All things considered she was doing very well at birth -- main troubles included torticollis, rapid respiratory rate, and jaundice (which was discovered today. She didn't get formula/milk until about 12 hours after birth, and did it via NG tube. She also got a TPN and lipids..which she is being weaned off of as her milk intake increases -- tonight she took 22mL via bottle when i fed her!  

She also came off of the heater yesterday and is in a regular bassinet. And they just took off her oxygen cannula today. 

I feel like she's progressing very quickly but at the same time she's still not totally great on the sucking thing and she's on the light therapy. 

My wife gets discharged on Sunday and it's going to be so tough to go home without our sweet little one but we need to go home to finish getting things ready...we thought we had at LEAST a few more weeks after all. I guess that's what we get for being unprepared.

The hospital is about 45 min away from home so the drive isn't too long but also feels like hours. 

Sorry to wrap this up so quickly, it's late here and I really should get some rest because I have to get up with my wife to pump in a couple hours. So feel free to ask any questions or share advice you may have. I gotta say, NICU nurses are fucking saints.

"Update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/ffia85/update\_to\_my\_anatomy\_scan\_filled\_with\_soft/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/ffia85/update_to_my_anatomy_scan_filled_with_soft/) 

X-post from my monthly bumpers sub! Very long post...apologize in advance!

TLDR: Several soft markers found in my 19 week anatomy scan plus a short cervix after low risk NIPT and normal 14 week NT scan. Amniocentesis scheduled for Wednesday morning.

Hi everyone! FTM here, 33 years old in the US. Everything was going great and I was feeling positive until my anatomy scan yesterday.

So my first trimester was breezy, no morning sickness or nausea, just the unbearable headaches here and there. Still running, still working out, still putting in long hours at my (demanding) office job. I thought I could do everything normally until my due date in July! My 14 week NT scan was normal and I also opted for NIPT which came back low risk and news of a baby girl! All blood work came back normal and I was considered low risk.

The second trimester also started out pretty uneventful. My belly was starting to show and although I didn't like the weight gain (body issues all throughout my life), I was feeling very lucky to be able to be a home to a growing baby girl for a few months. My husband and I couldn't wait to see our daughter during our anatomy scan! I even brought my mom along so she could see her granddaughter.

Our anatomy scan was scheduled for 9am on a Friday. The tech did a vaginal US first to measure the cervix and look at the placenta. Then she moved to my belly where she did all her other measurements. We saw baby girl's feet (she was moving so much!), her stomach, and her little face. We saw one open hand and heard her heartbeat. Her weight was at a normal 12 ounces. The tech stepped outside to get the doctor, which she never has had to before with my other ultrasounds. The doctor came in and right off the bat told us there were a few issues that they found.

First, she said my cervix was short and suspected for insufficiency, which might mean possible miscarriage or preterm birth. I would have to come back in two weeks to see if it has changed, and if not, I may need to take meds or a stitch, which I thought was doable, as long as the baby is fine. I'll take any pain or procedure to ensure that my daughter will be born healthy.

Then, the blow to our happiness ... she said there were a few soft markers for trisomies that they were seeing: (a) CPC, soft marker for trisomy 18, (b) echogenic focus, soft marker for trisomy 13 and 21, and (c) pyelectasis, soft marker for trisomy 21. She also said that since one hand wouldn't open up, that could mean trisomy 18 and also my nuchal fold was measuring a little bigger than it should which we all know could be a soft marker for Downs.

Our smiles all of a sudden turned to worry and doubt. How could everything come all at once? How was it possible that my NIPT was low risk as well as my 14 week NT scan and every blood test was normal, and now I am at risk for all of these trisomies? The doctor said that if there was only one soft marker, they wouldn't worry so much, but since there were several, it would be best if I went to see a genetic counselor, who luckily had room for us within the next 30 minutes. We rushed upstairs and I broke down in her office. My husband was angry and upset and I was crying hysterically, mostly because it was such a shock and I definitely did not wake up thinking I would have to deal with anything like this that day.

She explained to us that the NIPT and the ultrasounds are only screening tests and the only way to get a definite diagnostic is to do an amniocentesis, if we choose, which we did not hesitate to do. She squeezed us in for this coming Wednesday which would mean we would get preliminary results that Friday. I understood the risk for miscarriage but I also knew that the information the amnio could give us outweighed the risks.

I have been crying and worrying for the past 24 hours and just feeling sad and depressed. I can't even look at anything baby related and answer any questions about my baby without crying. I've been spending my time reading posts on Reddit about women seeing several soft markers in their US and things ending up fine but also a few posts of things going not so fine. I am really just trying to stay positive and not to think about it until my amnio on Wednesday but it's so hard not feel robbed of the pregnancy that I was envisioning. It's just been a dark cloud for my husband and I. We are still unsure of what we would do if we received news that the baby was positive for something...I know I am also on a timeline because IF we choose to terminate, I would only have until week 24...that's the end of this month!

Anyway, I just really needed to vent and type out my emotions. Thanks for reading if you made it all the way down here! :)",25.0,10.355665751583432,25.0,0.074,0.846,0.079,0.7881,4959,2,0.9365903050246804,1.8499999999999999
"I have been feeling so sad the last couple days, just needed to vent a little. My daughter has been in the NICU almost 7 weeks now. She had surgery this past Wednesday to correct an issue with a heart valve wrapping around her trachea and esophagus. It went really well and she is otherwise very healthy and we are SO grateful. 

 I've been sort of grieving the fact that everything has been so far from what we imagined (I know, the NICU is not really in anyone's birth plan.) I was sent for an appointment at a hospital an hour away from home and they decided to induce me right then- different city, different hospital than we planned. I ended up having an emergency C-section and didn't see her until the next day. We're far from home, which is hard enough. I'm sad that we can't hold her much, I feel like she's laying there looking at me thinking 'Hey mom! Hold me!! Her first Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas will be spent in the hospital. We tried for almost 3 years before getting pregnant with her, our first, and it just feels like a cruel joke - you finally have your dream come true and BAM! Sorry, still can't have your baby. Not only will I have to go back to work so soon after she's able to come home, but I feel like we sort of missed out on her being a newborn. (She was born 38+6 so she was full term.) I am really struggling to pump milk too. Barely get 20 mL each time. I feel like I'm failing at even trying to feed her! 

Now I know we are very lucky, all things considered. There are so many babies and families here that are going through much harder situations than we are. Everyone around me keeps telling me ""it could be worse"" and I know it could, but I feel like my feelings are being dismissed. I understand it could be worse, but it doesn't make my feeling of sadness any less real. 

Just needed to vent. It's been a rough few days. I'm sure that these feelings are all normal- or at least normal in the NICU?",37.0,7.483880525307155,37.0,0.095,0.819,0.085,-0.8085,1955,1,1.1175155864015998,3.515
"Hi everyone. On Thursday I gave birth to my baby boy via c-section at 28 weeks and 2 days. He’s doing great in the NICU but I’m really struggling for a few reasons. I’m here in the hospital alone because of the pandemic (my husband is waiting out a self-quarantine because of international travel and won’t be able to visit until Sunday. He was able to attend the birth with proper distancing and protocol). I’m pumping every two hours and in a lot of pain from the operation so I’m reliant on the nurses for absolutely everything - helping me shift stuff around my room, adjusting lights, washing pump parts, etc. - and I’m constantly meeting with nurses, doctors, case managers, lactation consultants, calling down to the NICU, etc.

Because I’m handling this alone it’s been really hard for me to actually spend lots of time at the NICU with my baby. I manage maybe two visits a day and I feel incredibly guilty. I know lots of time holding him and doing skin to skin is best for him but I’m in a situation where I pump and then a bunch of people poke their heads in to lay a bunch of information on my lap and they have to draw blood or flush my IV or push on my stomach and by then it’s time to pump again and I try to rush down to the NICU and I have fifty bazillion missed texts/calls because everyone wants to see the baby and I’m just so tired dealing with it by myself. My sister in law has been here for a few hours every day with me (I’ve been in the hospital since March 7 due to risk of preterm labor) and she’s been great but it’s really hard at night when I’m exhausted.

I know I only have to get through another 24 hours before my husband gets here but it’s just been so tough. I meditate, I look at photos of my baby and my older son, I still feel like I struggle. I delivered my oldest child vaginally at full term and did not anticipate this level of helplessness, moreover doing it in a pandemic where traditional ways people would help (babysitting my older son so husband can help, visiting me in the hospital) have been taken off the table by doctors.

"I don’t know if I even want advice or if I just want to feel less alone.  I really hope I’m not the only one going through this (I’m not that special so probably not.) 

Background: I’ve always had anxiety and been diagnosed with OCD since 17. I’ve tried 4 different SSRIs at varying doses, and been in therapy for over 20 years with a variety of different style therapists including CBT. Only one therapist made significant improvements and he’s way out of state (and my dad was paying at the time- I can’t afford him and I’m now too old for my dad to pay.) SSRIs do nothing, which is common for OCD. The only drugs that work are the ones that basically sedate me to the point where I can’t do anything but that’s hardly a good life lol. I can start therapy again in January (ran out of sessions this year) but I’m really dubious that it’ll even help. 

Our “journey” to get pregnant was really hard, as we did IVF, and we have a 0% chance of natural conception. Yes I’m aware some people have it harder but infertility was a trauma for me. So maybe for that reason I’m plagued with thoughts that this pregnancy is only a dream, that the other shoe will drop. I imagine life saying “oh you thought you graduated from infertility? Ha!” I still feel jealous of pregnant women and moms. I still hide people on Facebook who announce pregnancies. My husband pointed out that I act like our IVF didn’t work and he’s right. 

I cant even list everything I’ve worried about since my BFP. I was overjoyed at first (still am...give me all the nausea/fatigue I want this baby so badly!) but that quickly devolved into a listeria obsession where I’m scared of eating any food that isn’t hot. I cant even imagine eating sushi, which I love. I read Expecting Better but felt it glossed over the areas I worry about the most. How can listeria be a 1/8,000 risk when it’s on 1 in 5 avocados? Nobody can explain this to me.  I’m afraid to take Tylenol. I’m afraid to drink juice. I eat plenty of food but I miss cold food. I’m even afraid to drink decaf tea as I read it can prevent folate absorption.

My symptoms (or lack thereof) are also a huge source of anxiety. I was pretty sick early on but at 8 weeks began feeling a little better and now at 10 weeks barely can tell I’m pregnant. We saw a great heartbeat at 8 weeks so I want to believe everything is okay but “a gradual decrease in symptoms” is obviously a sign of MC. RE told me it’s normal right about now and didn’t want to scan me again. I still worry. 

I worry about my arcuate uterus causing 2nd trimester loss. RE says it won’t. I don’t believe her.  I’ve seen websites saying it does. She says they’re wrong, I ruminate. 

And of course I worry ABOUT worry. My husband told me that my anxiety is “hurting the baby.” Great. Now if God forbid anything does happen I’ll blame myself. But I can’t control the emotions I feel. I’m still able to eat healthy, stay active and somehow sleep a full night. What else can I do?

The advice I get mostly seems to come from a place of “how can I minimize how annoying you are to ME?” I know everyone thinks I’m annoying. No longer speaking about how I feel and isolating myself isn’t going to make me less anxious. “Staying off the internet” isn’t going to make me less anxious (although I’m no longer researching stuff.) people’s advice to me is basically “go away you’re annoying.” Like being annoying is even my biggest concern right now. 

The women on my bumper sub are doing cute announcements, buying stuff for the baby and talking names. They’re eating sushi and deli meat. Im so jealous. I wish I could be so certain that everything will be fine. I wish I could buy a baby onesie. I hate even walking into the nursery or calling it a nursery at all. I don’t have my next scan until 12 weeks and despite “knowing” that my risk of loss is in the ballpark of 1% my mind feels like it’s a 15% or so risk. I just want to enjoy my pregnancy. I thought I’d be so happy once I got here but I’m so scared!

I hope that I’ll feel better once he’s here but I know that’s absurd because I thought I’d feel better once I got pregnant and although I’m ridiculously happy to BE pregnant I regularly question if I even am.",40.0,9.296046673098566,40.0,0.137,0.717,0.146,0.9025,4224,4,0.9382918978152182,5.48
"(I posted this in my bumper sub, but wanted it to be searchable here as well, in case it helps someone looking for experiences) 

Warning, long post ahead! 

I wanted to share my experience with this because when I was searching trying to find someone who had an endoscopy while pregnant, I couldn’t find a whole lot. If anyone needs to talk about this, don’t be afraid to message me, even if this post is years old! 

I had an upper GI endoscopy today at 14 weeks and 3 days pregnant. I have been having stomach pain basically 24/7 since August (since I was 4-5 weeks). I was diagnosed with Hyperemisis Gravidarum and gastritis. After months of meds for the gastritis (including a switch to something stronger) my condition wasn’t improving at all. I’ve lost over 20 pounds from being unable to eat much.  Eating causes intense pain no matter what I eat or how much. (If you want more details about my symptoms, feel free to ask!) 

The GI specialist first told me that I would be sedated and given an anxiety medication for the procedure. She said since I was pregnant, they’d give me the minimal amount to stay on the safe side. She also assured me that the procedure was generally safe and that the risk was less than what my weight loss and lack of adequate nutrition could do if it continued. I was warned though that fetal death was possible due to the drugs given. Whatever would sedate me would sedate the baby. She also said there is slight evidence that the procedure could lead to a lower birth weight but that she didn’t think preterm labor was a concern. 

So today was the procedure. A labor and delivery nurse was called to come check the baby via Doppler. It was at this time that my GI doctor informed me that I wouldn’t be able to get the anxiety medication or the usual sedation drugs because I was pregnant and it wasn’t safe enough for the Ob’s comfort. Instead she said they would numb my throat and give me a small amount of Demerol, which is a class B pain killer. I was to be fully awake and conscious for the procedure as opposed to sedated or even twilight sedated. 

I was very freaked out. 

The numbing spray was super gross and it burned my throat a lot. The Demerol went in via IV and that burned too. They ended up giving me 3x the amount of Demerol than she planned because my body just absorbs painkillers, but it was still a safe dosage. 

The rest of the procedure was awful but quick. Because I was fully awake, I gagged almost the entire time. Lots of deep air burps and gagging. They tell you not to swallow but it’s impossible to not. You also can’t breath through your mouth and that can be a bit anxiety inducing as well, especially when you’re gagging so frequently it feels like you can’t catch your breath. Every so often I’d feel like the tube settled and I’d stop gagging, only for her to move the tube or blow air into my stomach, causing the gagging all over again.  My whole body was shaking hard from the unpleasantness of it all. 

The doctor was kind and kept saying encouraging things and giving me a countdown of how much longer it would be.  The relief I felt when she pulled the tube out was amazing. I was insanely relaxed  almost immediately and was so excited it was done. 

Because they didn’t really sedate me, I didn’t have to spend too long in recovery. I got another Doppler scan (baby’s heart sounded just as good as before the procedure) and then I was sent home with instructions to not drive for the rest of the day. 

The only thing they found was that I have a small hiatal hernia. She said this shouldn’t be causing my symptoms though. 

I’ve felt fine since the procedure. I have a super mild sore throat but my stomach and esophagus don’t feel any different. I was able to eat as soon as I got home. 

Now I just wait on the biopsy results to see if anything hidden is going on. 

Overall this experience really really sucked. I hope that if I ever have to have this done in the future, I’ll be able to be fully sedated for it, but at least now I know I can get through it without sedation and it won’t be the total end of the world. 

That being said, I would take this experience over the medically induced panic attack I had when I was given IV Reglan in the ER a few months ago lol.",24.0,9.8177900677276,24.0,0.1,0.772,0.127,0.9844,4292,0,0.7873395795606645,2.4000000000000004

"Hello all.  First time posting.  I wanted to share my experience and also have somewhere to post updates.  With all the research I've done, I've found that most people share what they've gone through with their babies up to the age of two or so, and leave it at that.  I am hoping to periodically come back to this to leave remarks on how we've progressed throughout the years.  I'm hoping to provide updates on how she's growing, how she's doing once she starts school, what her learning skills are like.  Obviously, this won't be the same for everybody, but maybe provide a little comfort for those going through this too.  So here's my story:

We found out we were pregnant on 3/7/19.  I had an 8 week ultrasound and all went ok.  They had initially put my due date at Oct 20th or so, but after that ultrasound, they changed it to October 30th based on her measuring at 8 weeks.

My next ultrasound was not scheduled until I was 19 weeks along.  At this ultrasound, they found the baby to only be measuring at 17 weeks, not 19.  I figured we were just adjusting the due date, but they felt this was a red flag and sent me to a specialist.

Here, they began doing all kinds of tests to determine why she was small.  I had an amnio test checking for chromosomal issues, infections, genetic disorders, etc.  All the tests came back negative.  They began monitoring me weekly, watching the blood flow in the umbilical cord, her growth, blood flow in the brain.  Everything was coming back normal.  They are deducing the issue to being with the placenta since they can find no other explanation.  As I am currently in the hospital waiting to be induced tomorrow, I wanted to share my timeline, the best that I can remember it up to this point. 

6/28/19  Should be 22 weeks, but she's (yes, it's a girl) only measuring at 18 weeks and weighing 253 grams.  They are preparing us for the worst, including early delivery, and the low chances of survival.  They couldn't tell us if she'd be healthy, physically or mentally.  The stress of it all, bringing a baby into the world that would be suffering, the struggle it would put on our family, my other children, was causing me to consider termination at one point.  I was a total mess, I couldn't get any straight answers because they didn't have any.  My husband and I decided to go forward and accept whatever may come.

7/12/19  24 weeks, measuring at 20-21 weeks, 357 grams.

7/17/19  25 weeks, measuring at 22, weighing 421 grams.  Got a second opinion.  Maybe they just had my due date wrong.  But no.  Based on all the information, 25 weeks is where I should be.  Baby IS growing, she's just small.  They don't know why.  They don't know if she'll survive.  Each week we make it is another milestone accomplished and reason to be grateful.  Both doctors are convinced we won't make it past 34 weeks.  That was heartbreaking to hear as I didn't really understand why.

7/19/19  Met with the NICU doctor to discuss what to expect, and whether we should be getting steroid shots (both specialists agreed on everything except whether I should get the shots, and when to get them).  Doctor convinced us to go ahead with shots to help with lung and brain functions.  This would help mostly if we needed to deliver this early.  NICU dr also explained that going past 34 weeks would put the baby at a higher risk of stillbirth, and delivering at 34 was not bad.

7/26/19  26 weeks, 474 grams

8/1/19  Baby has gained more than 100 grams in 2 weeks and while she is below the third percentile, her growth curve is still on par with the typical curve and as long as we are, specialist thinks we might make it to 34 weeks, but is still being cautious.

8/8/19  28 weeks and weighing 561 grams.  (For perspective, the fiftieth percentile at 28 weeks should be about 1200 grams),  We're hoping to make it to 30 weeks and gain another 150g.

8/21/19  30 weeks, measuring at 26 weeks - 701 grams.  Proportionately, everything looks good.  Specialist thinks we might be able to push delivery out to 36 weeks.

8/27/19  Weekly ultrasound checks now adds 20 minutes of being on the monitors to check for contractions and watching heart rate.

9/3/19  32 weeks, measuring at 27 weeks, 974 grams.

9/8/19  Second round of steroids

9/17/19  2lb 7oz.  Only a 5oz growth in 2 weeks. 

9/19/19  Baby has not grown enough to stay in.  Got sent to the hospital to discuss a third round of steroids and delivery options.  Because last steroids came two weeks ago, they (NICU and delivery doctor) said a third round may not necessarily be beneficial.  Baby is head down so a c-section was not needed.  We began softening the cervix and will begin Pitocin in the morning.  I can't help but feel a little disappointed that we didn't make it to at least 36 weeks.  I know making it to 34 is a huge accomplishment, but there are many things I'm missing out on now, such as the joy of being so pregnant, not being able to keep my little bun in the oven.  But as previously mentioned, the risk of her being in there vs the help we can give her out here outweighs all else.  I will provide updates after delivery and during recovery/NICU of our experience.  Thanks for reading.",1.0,10.849102889694834,1.0,0.059,0.834,0.106,0.9941,5227,0,0.5565512687482314,0.059
"TRIGGER WARNING for anyone sensitive to topics around weight/eating disorders etc

So to give a little background info:
I'm 23 years old, 169cm tall, and before I got pregnant I was 62/63kg. I'm from England but I am living in Japan, and will give birth here.
I have had a history if eating disorders (anorexia/bulimia) since I was a teenager, but I managed to recover before getting pregnant (for the sake of my baby and pregnancy).
I'm now 13 weeks pregnant, and I weigh 65kg (bmi of 22.7), so I've gained around 2-3kg. 
My morning sickness is the kind of morning sickness that didn't make me throw up, but I still get painfully nauseous and the only way to manage that is to eat regularly/enough, and the only food I've been able to stomach is simple carbohydrates/junk food, which is probably why I've gained weight.
I'm aware that I should be eating healthier but I planned to eat as healthy and as many nutricious foods as possible as soon as my morning sickness subsides.

Recently I went for a check up at the maternity clinic, and I didn't know I will be weighed so I ate breakfast and lunch before leaving, and I was then weighed (also with all my clothes on) so I wasn't surprised that I weighed 67kg, and I explained to the nurse that I had already eaten and wearing clothes and so that's not my true weight, and my real weight is probably closer to 65kg. 

However she was very alarmed, and told me that I've already gained too much weight. She said my limit for weight gain is 10kg over my pre pregnancy weight, so I should not weigh more than 73kg by the end of my pregnancy, but I am already 67kg, meaning I can only gain 6kg more. She told me if I gain more than that, I could be refused by the hospital where I am planning to give birth, and also I may have to have a c section, because apparently I will be too fat, so my birth canal will get too small.

This was terrifying to hear, as someone who has grown up in England, I'm used to hearing that you should always eat enough when pregnant (around 2000-2200 calories in the second and third trimester) so I had no idea how I'm supposed to stop myself from gaining weight. 
I asked the nurse, and she said I should only eat low calorie foods, and be careful of my salt intake.

Because of my eating disorder past, it's hard for me to understand how much food is too little/too much (i also have BPD so I struggle with very black and white thinking) and I need to understand how much I should eat in terms of calories, so I told her I will eat as healthily as I can, and around 2000 calories.
She looked alarmed again, and told me 2000 calories is way too much, and recommended I should stick to 1500 calories.

I have no choice but to follow what she told me, but for my height, 1500 calories is the amount that is recommended to lose weight, as if you are on a diet, so this made me extremely scared, seeing as I'm so used to hearing you can harm your growing baby if you diet or lose weight while pregnant. The reason I stopped restricting what I ate/fasting/purging was so that I can have a healthy pregnancy and baby, so I don't understand why I'm now being told to restrict what I eat, even though I'm at a healthy bmi.

I've seen some foreigners living in Japan who have said on forums that their baby was underweight/born prematurely because of sticking to Japan's strict pregnancy weight guidelines, so I feel confused because I want to follow what she said (to not be at risk of being rejected by the hospital) but I really don't want to risk harming my baby's growth. I can't stop thinking about it and I feel so stressed about what is the right thing to do. 

I guess this was kind of a rant, but I'd like to hear some reassurance if anyone has any experience with these weight guidelines in Japan, or if it's safe to eat 1500 calories/diet while pregnant and I'm just freaking out over nothing? Maybe english weight guidelines are too loose and Japan's strict weight guidelines are the healthier option? Any advice would be really appreciated😂",1.0,10.232507220970918,1.0,0.117,0.794,0.09,-0.9741,4048,2,1.2998555716031555,0.117

"This is going to long and it’s rambling and I’m sorry. Please scroll down to the TL:DR if it’s too much. 

It’s been about 3.5 almost 4 months since we’ve left the NICU but I’m really struggling to shake the experience. Since leaving, my son has been healthy and happy as a clam. 

Im a FTM. gave birth and soon after they took my son to the NICU to treat hypoglycaemia which was caused by medication I was prescribed during pregnancy. He was admitted for 7 nights and 8 days. Which I know, doesn’t sound like a lot of time but it felt like I was in the Twilight Zone. We stayed in a Ronald McDonald’s parents room and I refused to leave the ward for his stay. while the nurses were wonderful, I felt like I experienced more pain (emotionally) than I ever thought possible as I watched my son yo-yo as he responded to medical treatment. 

I thought that after this much time has passed that the days we spent in the NICU would have been a blur. As you all know, days and nights sorta meld together, time is irrelevant, I didn’t see the sun or go outside so,  I thought all of it would have smooshed into one giant blob of monitor beepings and nurse shift changes. Especially because 1 week is such a short time compared to what many other parents experience. 

But it didn’t. I remember everything in excruciating detail. I remember all the nurses names, I remember all the alarms I set, I remember what I ate, the baby wipe “showers” I took, how small my baby was, waiting by his bassinet 20 minutes before we could feed him to make sure we caught his weight and blood sugar measurements. You get the idea. 

I found a FB meet up group for parents who have children in the NICU shortly after joining this sub. It says that it’s open for both past and present NICU parents. My brother, who’s a psychiatrist and my best friend, who next to my husband, my main support during my time at the NICU however doesn’t think that this FB group is appropriate for me. He says that there are no lasting affects on my son and that I need to stop dwelling on it or it will begin to affect my mental health. Moreover, my stay was not as long or for something as serious as other parents experience and it may seem a bit insulting to them to act as if I experienced something similar. Like I said he’s in the medical profession but he’s also my big brother so I’m not really sure if this is his “professional opinion” or “brotherly opinion”. 

I especially feel guilty because I should be over it by now. In comparison, 7 days is not long. My baby is healthy now. I see parents here who’ve been in the NICU for weeks, months, with no end in sight. Parents that deal with chronically ill children. I don’t want to walk in there an act like I’m on the same level and make a fool of myself or worse, upset someone who is already going through something upsetting. At the same time, I’m hurting. I don’t know how to “get over it” I’m anxious about the prospect of a second child because how will I be able to go through that experience again? With another child at home who needs me? What if the next one stays longer? Or had a worse condition? 

TL;DR: I was only in the NICU with my son for a week for something that seems to be fairly common place. I don’t think my experience is comparable to others in the NICU but I can’t seem to get over it. Will I offend other parents by going to a FB support group meet up?",7.0,9.239073249247943,7.0,0.106,0.806,0.088,-0.9296,3411,5,1.2044085899329622,0.742

"My daughter was born almost 2 weeks ago at 31+5. Luckily I had received steroid injections because I was at risk of preterm labor. She was only on CPAP for 1.5 days and just got moved to the step down unit from the NICU, which is awesome! The next part will just be waiting for her to be ready to eat from a bottle/breast, which we know takes time (our first was also born early, at 35+4).

However, because I now have a 4.5 year old and live further from the hospital I can’t be at the hospital as much as I wish I could. We are lucky that our hospital has cameras that allow us to watch our sweet babe when we’re not there, but it’s now causing me to feel horrible guilt. She is now awake more and any time I see her laying there awake and alone, I break down. 

Any experience/insight/thoughts into how to help get through this portion of hospitalization? I know that she’s in the best hands and I do spend as much time with her as I can, but it still feels like it’s not enough.

"My daughter was born yesterday 10/26 at 12:55 am. She was twelve days overdue. The labor was long and tough on both my wife and the baby. 

During labor at some point the baby became Hypoxic which means she didn’t get enough oxygen to her brain for a period of time. When she was finally born she was almost non-responsive, hardly moving and letting out only the weakest cries. The NICU who was already in the room due to meconium concerns got to work immediately and then transferred her upstairs to the NICU.

Within 20 minutes her Apgar score had gone from a two to a five which showed some improvement but not enough for them to like it. They decided that the best course of action was to transfer her to a level one NICU. Luckily we have one about twenty minutes away and it is considered one of the best NICU in New York State. 

She’s been placed in a treatment called Therapeutic Hypothermia which does a lot of things but mostly improves her blood gas but also limits swelling and other damage from her brain injury due to lack of oxygen. 

She’s continuing to improve but they are concerned that her EEG is showing signs of seizure like activity at times. They are monitoring it heavily and are going to do an MRI as soon as they can safely do so. 

I got to visit her and she’s crying really loudly now and moving a lot. She opened her eyes and looked at me and I was able to sooth her a bit. She’s already way better than she was so I’m optimistic this is the right way to help her. 

It’s been a tough couple of days so far. Mom is still in the hospital due to pre-eclampsia like symptoms post partum. So I left the delivery hospital without my wife and without my daughter. That was one of the toughest moments of my life. 

We haven’t been able to hold our daughter since she was born. My wife saw her for maybe ten minutes before they transferred her to the other NICU. I’ve visited and spent a few hours with her but I cannot imagine my wife’s pain at not having her baby and not breastfeeding her. 

It’s tough and we don’t know how my daughter will be long term but we decided last night we are ready for it no matter what. We’re just going to take it a day at a time. 

The good news is my wife is being discharged today and we’ll both be able to see our daughter together.

I see parents here who’ve been in the NICU for weeks, months, with no end in sight. Parents that deal with chronically ill children. I don’t want to walk in there an act like I’m on the same level and make a fool of myself or worse, upset someone who is already going through something upsetting. At the same time, I’m hurting. I don’t know how to “get over it” I’m anxious about the prospect of a second child because how will I be able to go through that experience again? With another child at home who needs me? What if the next one stays longer? Or had a worse condition? 

TL;DR: I was only in the NICU with my son for a week for something that seems to be fairly common place. I don’t think my experience is comparable to others in the NICU but I can’t seem to get over it. Will I offend other parents by going to a FB support group meet up?",19.0,9.012022770189423,19.0,0.106,0.806,0.088,-0.9296,3411,5,1.2044085899329622,2.014
"I was induced at 37 weeks, and our baby spent the first week of her life in the NICU. I know that so many parents have a much harder and longer stay than ours and my heart goes out to all of you. I had a really hard time during pregnancy, then my delivery was 3 days, and then she was taken to the NICU. 
Our baby has been home for 3 weeks now. She is still on oxygen, and is doing well, but I’m not. 
I feel so overwhelmed by anxiety and fear that something bad will happen to her I’m losing sleep and I think I’m exhausting my husband. I’m trying to stay calm and focus on the positives but any thought of having to take her into a hospital stops my heart. I blame myself constantly for everything. 
Because she was in the NICU breastfeeding has been difficult. I mostly bottle feed formula with some breast milk. 
I’m scared. I’m anxious. I’m tired. I’m guilty. And I’m missing out on the joys of being a family because of it.

"Hey all,

My name's Spencer, I'm part of the production team at Rethink and we're doing a charity commercial in partnership with the Canadian Premature Babies Foundation. [www.cpbf-fbpc.org/about-us](https://www.cpbf-fbpc.org/about-us) They do amazing work supporting families through the initial stages of the premature birth journey. Right now we're sourcing video content for our spot and we'd love to use some of your home clips if you're interested!

The focus of our video is the NCIU graduation ceremony. We know how important this milestone is for everyone involved and we want to celebrate that by creating a video that showcases the important moments leading up to it. We're looking for clips of those significant points in your journey that you feel would inspire others in the same situation. 

I understand this can be a bit of an intimate ask but we feel it has the potential to raise some money for a really noble cause and help prepare others who are soon to face the same challenges. 

You can upload the footage directly below. You can also reach out to me via comment here or personally at [spencer.houghton@rethinkcanada.com](mailto:spencer.houghton@rethinkcanada.com) . I'm happy to field any of your questions or concerns.

"My daughter was born almost 2 weeks ago at 31+5. Luckily I had received steroid injections because I was at risk of preterm labor. She was only on CPAP for 1.5 days and just got moved to the step down unit from the NICU, which is awesome! The next part will just be waiting for her to be ready to eat from a bottle/breast, which we know takes time (our first was also born early, at 35+4).

However, because I now have a 4.5 year old and live further from the hospital I can’t be at the hospital as much as I wish I could. We are lucky that our hospital has cameras that allow us to watch our sweet babe when we’re not there, but it’s now causing me to feel horrible guilt. She is now awake more and any time I see her laying there awake and alone, I break down. 

Any experience/insight/thoughts into how to help get through this portion of hospitalization? I know that she’s in the best hands and I do spend as much time with her as I can, but it still feels like it’s not enough.

"I really just want to talk to someone and vent because I’m feeling so broken and alone. My husband is the most perfect man on the surface, even my dad who is a psychologist didn’t see through him. But I think he’s a sociopath. I had the worst pregnancy of all time, I lost 30 pounds because id throw up even from drinking water. 2 months into it, My best friend died an unexpected and particularly gruesome/preventable death two days after my birthday. I found out that two days after her death, he made a bunch of affair profiles. My baby came 4 months early at only 1 lb and was only given a 50/50 chance to live. The whole time we were in the NICU my husband was going to see prostitutes, some of whom he knew were trafficking victims/had been drugged. He’s been to multiple massage parlors for happy endings and has talked with multiple women he’s met online. I confronted him on it and he’s still doing that stuff but just more sneakily thinking I don’t know. He left my baby alone at the house to go buy MDMA from his drug dealer and spend $1000 which was supposed to be for baby’s medical bills on a prostitute one night when I offered to watch the baby for him so he could go to a friends house. My baby is very medically needy being that he’s premature, he’s hooked up to a lot of machinery and he’s immuneocompromised so I can’t just take him and leave. I’m living in a different country so I can’t just drive to someone I know. I’m completely alone here with this sociopath and a sick baby. I’m dying mentally having to be around him, he made me fall so in love and give him a baby just to destroy me like this. The only thing keeping me from just killing myself are my elderly parents and baby. I don’t know what to do, I dint think there’s anything I can do since baby’s sick and will be hooked up to machines for the foreseeable future. So I’m stuck in this house, in a sexless marriage, being cheated on and disrespected constantly, neglected and left to watch this baby alone all day. No job (can’t drive), no friends, no family. Alone :( I’m sorry this isn’t very coherent but I really feel like I’m falling apart and I just need someone to hear me.

TLDR: can’t leave my sociopath cheating husband because I have a very sick child hooked up to machinery. Living in a different country with no family or friends. I’m stuck in a house with him while he continually abuses and cheats on me and leaves me to tend to the baby all to myself.",38.0,8.534991427447547,38.0,0.207,0.717,0.076,-0.9976,2455,0,2.7233258781739247,7.866

"Hi, everyone.  I’m new to this sub but I am hoping to get some feedback on my son’s situation.  He was born at 35+3 after I developed severe preeclampsia and was kept in the NICU for 12 hours after birth but did not require any intervention at that time.  He was discharged from the hospital on day 2 of life but then readmitted on day 4 due to jaundice.  At that time, he was put on O2 because they noticed he would occasionally desat to the low 80s.  The staff said that this was not uncommon, both because he was early and because we live at 5,500 feet above sea level.  They did a chest x-day while he was there and saw nothing abnormal or concerning.

He was discharged again on day 6 and sent home with O2 (setting on portable tank is 1/16, which I think corresponds to 0.06 L/min?).  He failed his overnight pulse ox study at 4 weeks with sats below 88 35% of the time.  Then he failed another overnight pulse ox study at 8 weeks with sats below 88 13% of the time.  He did another study last week at 11 weeks - we are waiting for the results, but both my husband and I saw sats in the low 80s on the monitor so we’re thinking he failed this one too.

We are concerned that he is still on O2 nearly three months after birth, and we feel bad because we don’t really take him anywhere very often because of the hassle of the tank and because his whole life, he’s had a cannula up his nose and stuck to his face.  His pediatrician said that it’s okay he’s still on O2 but we are wondering when he will be able to get off of it.  (I should add that, thankfully, he has had no other health issues other than the jaundice since he was born, and that resolved pretty quickly after light therapy was initiated.)

Has anyone here had a similar experience?  How long did it take for your baby of similar gestational age to get off oxygen and did that process involve weaning?  Should we be concerned about lung issues since it’s taking him longer than expected to be off O2?  I would really appreciate any feedback - thanks so much!

"I’m so sad to have to be writing this. I don’t know anyone else personally whose has had a baby in the NICU. 

My pregnancy was perfect. I had absolutely no complications. He was scheduled for an induction a few days early at 40+5. My doctor asked if I wanted to wait till week 41 or go early. I’ve been so worried that pregnancy, my second, and asked if I could come a few days earlier. I’m so grateful that I did now. 

They were supposed to give me a foley bulb, but instead I received what’s called a “cook”? And told to come back in 24hrs, 7pm on Monday. I was having intense contractions all night into the next day.. when we got to the hospital I was in so, so much pain and having intense back labor. 

They checked me and found I was 8cm. 

His heart kept dropping and the doctor, who I hadn’t met her, explained she was so concerned about him fluctuating she came as soon as she finished two other deliveries. She checked me and broke my waters, where they found so, so much meconium. She came back after my epidural to see if she could flush me out with what looked like saline? But when she felt again she felt his cord and immediately told the nurses, “Prolapsed cord,” and I started to cry. I knew what that meant. My husband had no clue, he was so confused. 

They told me I had to have an immediate c-section and I cried the whole way there. I had the sweetest nurse my entire time. She was wonderful. 

He was born at 10:22pm on 4/20. I saw him for maybe 5-10 seconds before he was taken away. They gave me a stronger dose of medicine with my epidural that put me to sleep while they cleaned me. 

I was taken to a room with a lot of empty beds and the nurse eventually called for my husband. He was crying. This is the second time in my life I’ve ever seen him cry. The doctor had explained to him because of the distress myself & him were in, they were concerned for his lack of oxygen, which was borderline. They took out so much meconium from his body. 

They told us he would be using a cooling vest, where he is now. They told us the concern was his body would try to produce too much oxygen too fast and cause a fever and/or seizures. We’re so grateful he’s stabilized. He hasn’t had any seizures and even though he’s still on oxygen, he’s doing okay. 

My husband and I cope differently. I know he believes I should be there every hour of every day. They’re only letting one parent in and we agreed it would be me. But every time I go to see him, I cry. I’m so happy he’s okay. But I can’t stop crying for so many reasons. I cry because he’s okay, but so uncomfortable. I cry when he cries that I can’t hold him and worry he’ll think no one cares and will come help him. Everyone has said it’s not my fault, but I still place the blame on myself somehow. 

The doctor was so kind. She did express that she truly felt if we had waited until his exact 41w and then some for a later induction, he might not have been okay. In her words, “I truly believe we would’ve had a different outcome.” She told me they wouldn’t have let me get so far in my pregnancy if everything hadn’t been going so well. 

He was in a “sunny side up” position and his head was more to my right side instead of straight down, allowing the cord to slip past him first. It was also the reason I was having such severe back labor. 

Thank you for anyone who reads. I just needed to write it out. I never imagined I would have to leave the hospital without him. I’m just so very sad.",20.0,9.351464800971764,20.0,0.123,0.783,0.094,-0.9738,3501,2,1.308371449845761,2.46
"FTM here 32w0d today and I just had an ultrasound yesterday to check baby's size as I measured small at my last midwife appointment.  Overall, the ultrasound was ""reassuring"" (radiologist's words), showing that baby is in 25th percentile for growth but with a small abdomen.  I'm reviewing the ultrasound results again this morning and it shows that baby's abdominal circumference is in the <5th percentile range, which really doesn't sound that good to me.

The doctors don't recommend getting the corticosteroids until week 24. We talked them down to 23 & 5. They said it won't work until week 24. Today I was feeling really anxious about not making it until then and started researching about the shots. According to ACOG you can give the shots as early as 23 weeks. One study showed it dropped mortality rates from 73.5% to 59.1% in week 23. My husband wants to wait until the 23 & 5 but my anxiety (intuition?) is wanting to do it ASAP. Does anybody have any experience getting the shots that early? I am 23 weeks exactly today. I know the shots don't work well if given too early but if I go into labor before the shots the chance of survival is so low.

My husband and I cope differently. I know he believes I should be there every hour of every day. They’re only letting one parent in and we agreed it would be me. But every time I go to see him, I cry. I’m so happy he’s okay. But I can’t stop crying for so many reasons. I cry because he’s okay, but so uncomfortable. I cry when he cries that I can’t hold him and worry he’ll think no one cares and will come help him. Everyone has said it’s not my fault, but I still place the blame on myself somehow. 

The doctor was so kind. She did express that she truly felt if we had waited until his exact 41w and then some for a later induction, he might not have been okay.

"I’m so sad to have to be writing this. I don’t know anyone else personally whose has had a baby in the NICU. 

My pregnancy was perfect. I had absolutely no complications. He was scheduled for an induction a few days early at 40+5. My doctor asked if I wanted to wait till week 41 or go early. I’ve been so worried that pregnancy, my second, and asked if I could come a few days earlier. I’m so grateful that I did now. 

They were supposed to give me a foley bulb, but instead I received what’s called a “cook”? And told to come back in 24hrs, 7pm on Monday. I was having intense contractions all night into the next day.. when we got to the hospital I was in so, so much pain and having intense back labor. 

They checked me and found I was 8cm. 

His heart kept dropping and the doctor, who I hadn’t met her, explained she was so concerned about him fluctuating she came as soon as she finished two other deliveries. She checked me and broke my waters, where they found so, so much meconium. She came back after my epidural to see if she could flush me out with what looked like saline? But when she felt again she felt his cord and immediately told the nurses, “Prolapsed cord,” and I started to cry. I knew what that meant. My husband had no clue, he was so confused. 

They told me I had to have an immediate c-section and I cried the whole way there. I had the sweetest nurse my entire time. She was wonderful. 

He was born at 10:22pm on 4/20. I saw him for maybe 5-10 seconds before he was taken away. They gave me a stronger dose of medicine with my epidural that put me to sleep while they cleaned me. 

I was taken to a room with a lot of empty beds and the nurse eventually called for my husband. He was crying. This is the second time in my life I’ve ever seen him cry. The doctor had explained to him because of the distress myself & him were in, they were concerned for his lack of oxygen, which was borderline. They took out so much meconium from his body. 

They told us he would be using a cooling vest, where he is now. They told us the concern was his body would try to produce too much oxygen too fast and cause a fever and/or seizures.

"Hi all,

So I’m sitting here in the NICU next to my little girl and I’m not sure the shock has quite worn off. My wife went into preterm labor last night and less than 24 hours later here we are with a baby girl. She had zero issues during the pregnancy and we are both trying to sort out what just happened. 

Anyway, right now baby is on a 72h neuroprotective bundle that limits stimulation. I’m wondering what I can be doing to be the best dad I can be. Right now I feel helpless just sitting here watching her not being able to do anything. I am also in the medical field so I know a little too much for my own good which isn’t helping either. Any advice you all have would be awesome and thanks in advance!",15.0,6.209606721821736,15.0,0.047,0.834,0.119,0.9066,715,0,0.3949247962356105,0.705
"I made a long post here explaining my situation but it's a bit of an essay so I'll boil it down here.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/da3ppe/vaping\_case\_present/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/da3ppe/vaping_case_present/)

I acquired a medical marijuana license for my Lyme disease as it proved incredibly beneficial for my inability to conceptualize things with my brain fog. I then proceeded to vaping dry herb and concentrates as I was told it was the healthiest inhalation method. As a medical user, I'd only use it a few times a day.. although the dry herb vape can make a small bowl last for 15 minutes so it yielded a lot of inhales. I did my research ahead of time to ensure I was buying the most health conscious herb vape exclusively composed of borosilicate glass in air paths and stainless steel/borosilicate glass in the heating chamber. (FYI: I've since found the right doc for Lyme and doing much better so you can disregard it. Any symptoms I list relating to Lyme have since gone away).

Anyways, 9 months later I go from someone with incredible cardio, even when out of shape, to chronic cigarette smoker cardio in my early 20s. Things suddenly got really bad about 3 weeks ago which made me aware of my lung damage. As mentioned in other post, I had persisting pain in upper left lung for awhile actually. I assumed it was a symptom of Lyme as one of my many symptoms over the years was heart palpitation and occasional sharp chest pains. I don't have much money but had an appt lined up to see a heart doctor per my Lyme doc's recommendations. I came to the realization that it was my lungs after about 3 days of very labored breathing, some coughs where I felt things clearing (mucus I assume), then finally, the same pain went to my right side. The last one made it clear for me.

It's been 3 weeks since and things have progressed but I worry that the damage will lead to scarring and permanent damage. My goal of course would be to achieve minimal permanent damage and I assume that'll require more than just letting my body heal.

Is there any natural way I might counteract this and aid in promoting optimal healing? Perhaps even stem cells sprayed on my lungs?

Things I'm doing: I’ve used eucalyptus essential oils in diffuser while varying between 1:2 and normal breathing 2-3 times weekly. It offered a lot of relief the first session when my lungs were surely at maximum inflammation and mucus. Using YMCA steam room twice a week. Been on a therapeutic keto and doing prolonged and intermittent fasting for 5+ months for Lyme; should conveniently prove beneficial in the healing process as it's a very clean, minimalist, no nonsense diet unlike most keto-goers doing it for weight loss. I typically exercise 4-5 times a week but had to slow things down the last 3 weeks. I've tried pushing my cardio twice in the last week but it sucks.

I greatly appreciate any constructive advice as I feel like I should be doing more. Criticism on the other hand for not self-diagnosing quicker w/my symptoms will only make a sad boy sadder. I've kicked myself enough over it. Eek, so much for boiling down my essay hah. Thank you for your time.

Edit: I immediately quit any forms of smoke or vape inhalation following initiation of mimicking pain in right lung. It's unlikely that I'll ever intentionally inhale smoke or vapor again.",6.0,9.249726793959208,6.0,0.1,0.791,0.109,0.6287,3401,2,0.9173470323823504,0.6000000000000001

"So question for y’all...I had twins on 08/31 at 29+6...Currently, on day 20 at the NICU 

First, is it a faux pas just to say my boys were born at 30 weeks instead of 29+6? Albeit, even its just for my own peace of mind. 

Second Breast milk supply question..
So I read that having a baby, or in my case babies, in the NICU can initially have a negative effect on BM supply. I reckoned it’s basically bc a pump doesn’t have the BM stimulation mojo that babies possess...I’ve also heard that some moms with an initial low supply magically get a boost as they near their original due date.  So have any of you initially started out with a less than robust BM supply while babies were in the NICU and the suddenly your bottle(s) overfloweth with boobie juice once you get around your due date?  Or is that just breast milk urban legend?

Third, twin A is crushing it so far, but twin B (the smaller one) is lagging somewhat behind.  Even though it’s expected bc he came into to the world smaller and had placenta/cord issues while in utero (IUGR).  So far both had good results on the their head/cranial ultrasounds, both had a Apgar score of 8/8, both are off their CPAP, both have had PICC lines removed, but twin B isn’t gaining weight at the rate twin A is.  Twin A was born weighing 3lbs and 1oz (now weighing 3lbs and 11oz) and twin B was born weighing 1lbs and 14oz (now weighing 2lbs and 6oz).  Also, while twin A is on the verge of being moved to an open crib, off his nasal cannula, and possibly starting to take a bottle sometime I the next week or so....his brother is still on a nasal cannula and hasn’t gotten out of the acute section the NICU.  So I say all that to say this...Has anyone had a similar circumstance with twins and if so how long was your NICU stay? And if one twin cane home before the other what was the difference? And did you find that once your twins were together again it made their progress improved exponentially? 

Fourth, if you’ve had one twin with IUGR and the other one without or if you had one baby with IUGR...Have you read/heard anything that would suggest a link  between a bay being diagnosed with IUGR and a slower neonatal weight gain compared to a preemie born at a low birth weight but not due to IUGR?",1.0,7.445856196765791,1.0,0.024,0.912,0.063,0.9602,2262,7,0.38089192191715604,0.024
"I barely know what life is anymore .  Im drained almost hopeless anxious exhaudted and just devastated and numb.  From the start I had a difficult pregnancy but the babies were fine until my body betrayed all 3 of us and my cervix began shortening. I gave birth at 32&2 and  that was a critical situation which affected my daughter most. Her twin brother was off oxygen within 2 days and just growing and feeding learning to regulate his temp.

Complaint: possible ectopic pregnancy
Duration: 5 days

On Tuesday, I took a pregnancy at home. Test was positive. Scheduled ob appointment on Sept 10. Wednesday, I had cramping with no spotting. Thursday, I continued to cramp and went to the ER to be checked. My hcg level was 350. My ultrasound results were put as: “Possible 3 mm intrauterine gestational sac near the fundal portion of the endometrium without definite fetal pole or yolk sac. Differential possibilities would include early gestation, nonviable pregnancy versus non visualized ectopic pregnancy. Recommend continued biochemical and sonographic follow up. A small amount of free pelvic fluid may be physiologic. Heterogeneous mixed echogenicity 2.2 cm nodular structure with some peripheral blood flow in the left ovary may represent a corpus luteal cyst.”
Saturday morning, I had my hcg drawn again and the level was 434, which is about a 28% raise in around 42 hours. I’m still having back pains and slight cramping along with feeling lightheaded and winded easily. I still have not had any bleeding or cramping. Just recurrent diarrhea. I’m unsure if I should be more worried about a possible ectopic and should get checked again, or if my doctors office would have already called me if my blood levels/symptoms were warning signs to them.

"Hello Nicu parents/ Nicu nurses. I was told about this group over a year ago when my twins were born at 26 weeks. This group has helped me really not feel alone in the process. My twins did very well and they are now happy healthy one year olds with no long term issues. As I look back around this year mark I am reminded how emotionally challenging it all was, all 100 plus days of it. I am also a therapist and have tried to look at this experience from that lens too. 

I want to start off by saying Nicu nurses are absolutely amazing. I am still friends with some and they genuinely still care so much about my twins. The nicu is a special place where you spend so much time with these nurses that they have an unintentional emotional support role, especially in higher level Nicus.

I wanted to provide some feedback from the therapist side of things on what I felt could have been helpful during such a dark time in my life. I’ve seen on here when a parent vocalizes anger about the nicu there usually is an amazing nurse commenting to explain why this thing happened. As kind as this is it also reads as minimizing that parents emotions. We are so angry, our lives are falling apart and we are grieving a healthy pregnancy, a healthy child and a life that we were promised. Most of us never thought we’d be in this place. And as much as your logic is well intentioned for most of us we can’t compute logic. We are in survival mode and just need empathy a simple “wow that sucks and must be hard”. And it’s definitely not a NICU nurses job to provide emotional support as you guys do so many other things. I guess I just want to recommend if someone is falling apart because their child backslide, don’t always meet this with ration. Try empathy or nothing. Sadly, telling us “this is normal” or “it’s better for the baby” doesn’t help us in the moment. We are shattering over and over again each day and as logical as I am about emotions I never wanted logic. I just wanted to be a human suffering. 

My hope here is not to pass judgement but to alleviate the pressure on the nurse to emotionally fix us. We can’t be fixed, not until that baby is hope and we process this trauma. And we’ll never truly go “back to normal” Also to parents, get therapy. My husband both went this route and I can imagine it softened the pain a bit and helped us probably save our marriage from the mounting pressure of a nicu stay.

"I was told to come here so here I am!

Beautiful healthy baby boy was born on the 19th. 41 weeks, not preemie. 

He was doing fine till the next day, he apparently aspirated during birth and needed antibiotics and oxygen.


Hes doing well. His last day for meds is today. Hes gaining weight, eats and poops and burps like a champ.

But his oxygen levels have stayed roughly the same all week and I'm a little sad. I was hoping he would be weaned off oxygen at the same time and come home this weekend. 

But hes still at 45% oxygen and 1.5. He sometimes can handle 40% for a while (longest was 3 hours) but then he needs to be bumped up again. 

Xrays say nothing is wrong with his heart or lungs, he just needs more time to get his lungs stronger.

Anyone else been in the same boat? I'm just sad today and a little scared he will never get better.

Apologies for grammar. This is hard to type on my phone.

My wife, other than being overweight, was perfectly healthy 4 years ago. She got pregnant with our daughter and everything started out fine. About 4 months before out daughter was born, she started developing problems with her teeth. Molars started cracking and breaking off and jaw pain slowly set in. The dentist did what they could while she was pregnant.

She had issues during the delivery. She started experiencing major neck and shoulder pain. Her jaw pain got worse. Both wife and daughter were in distress and a C-section has to be done. Postpartum pre-eclampsia set in after the c-section. The doctors got that under control and finally sent my wife home almost 2 weeks later. Her jaw pain got worse. The shoulder and neck pain stuck around. We got her to see multiple oral surgeons about the jaw pain with no results. On top of that, my wife developed major postpartum depression.

We finally got my wife to a pain management specialist who diagnosed her with trigeminal neuralgia. This was about 7 months after our daughter was born. By the time she was diagnosed for the jaw pain, she began developing severe lower back and hip pain. After multiple tests, they found slipped and degraded discs in her lower back as well as major arthritis in her neck. After transferring to a new PCP, she began developing more issues. She started experiencing constant fatigue, headaches, and minor joint pain. 

When my wife would go to stand up, or sometimes take a few steps after not moving, she would experience major dizziness. After a few months of what seemed to be random dizziness, numbness, tingling, and twitching started to develop in her right hand while she was experiencing the dizziness. Her PCP did multiple blood tests, x-rays and blood pressure testing. They found she was ANA positive but did not have lupus. The PCP loosely diagnosed her with fibromyalgia and possibly Sjogrens Disease. We, including the PCP, weren't happy with this diagnosis because there was still a bigger issue. We also discovered that she has Hashimoto's disease. 

In the past 2 years, symptoms have gotten worse. Her cognitive ability has decreased. She struggles to concentrate, has issues stumbling over her words, she experiences blurred vision from time to time. The dizziness/numbness issue has gotten worse. Now she gets a numb burning/needling feeling that starts in the right hand, moves up her arm, down her leg, and has started spreading to the left side of her body. This just keeps adding question marks. All the doctors she has seen have not been able to make a successful diagnosis.

I am hoping someone here may have some insight or suggestions to help her. We just moved to Texas and hoping maybe some doctor may have an idea. But we are struggling at this point. She is taking so many medications and symptoms still keep flaring up.

"First time pregnancy, currently 22wks, and yesterday I cried because I was feeling so overwhelmed about making this decision with my husband.

It's easy to find references from women who used a doula and loved the experience. My friends/family that I've talked to never considered it in the first place. After reading *Expecting Better* and *Birth Without Fear*, I started to thinking about the benefits even though I don't want an unmedicated birth. It would be a big financial commitment for us.

I'd love to hear from anyone who planned a hospital delivery under care of an OB, and considered paying for a doula... but then didn't use one. **What helped you make the decision not to hire a doula? What did you consider in the decision process?**

I'm definitely feeling some guilt about choosing *not* to hire someone now that I've seen the statistics on how they do help with birth outcomes.... I feel like I owe this little one and my future self the best statistical chances of positive outcomes and recovery. But, I can't tell if a doula *really* would make a difference or I'm just psyching myself out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A little more about my personal situation which may or may not be relevant:

* I cope with nerves by obsessively researching and preparing for all outcomes, often with spreadsheets and flow charts. I can learn all about common labor challenges and interventions ahead of time and put together a birth plan wish-list, but still when push comes to shove (HA!) I am really worried about getting overwhelmed and panicky to the point of anxiety attack. Really, the main worry I have is having a panic attack or three during labor.
* My husband wants to be supportive, but has his own issues around doctors and hospitals and he isn't a great medical advocate for himself, and doesn't fully trust himself to advocate for me if/when I start to lose my shit.
* My OB is supportive, respectful, and open to all the Evidence Based Birth questions that I brought to my last appointment. During labor, I don't think I would trust a doula more than I trust my OB if she suggested a medical intervention... but of course we can't know for certain that our OB will be the one there making the suggestions.
* I get along well with my mom and she's very comfortable dealing with medical questions and doctors. She isn't local but is a 3 hour drive away, so she is potentially an option for a second support person if we didn't hire a doula.",40.0,7.594754376853158,40.0,0.103,0.752,0.146,0.9533,2471,2,0.7054311348537771,4.12

"I’m at my wit’s end, and I hope someone on here can help me. 

I’m 29 weeks pregnant today, and about 3 weeks ago, I started experiencing some itching on my arms that soon spread to other areas of my body. 

At first, it was just itching with no visible rash, and, since I’m pregnant, I was initially worried about having Cholestasis of Pregnancy or ICP. Within days of the itching starting, my doc sent me to the lab to get my liver screened and my bile acids checked to see if I have ICP. Everything came back normal. I also did not have the main symptom of ICP which is itching in the hands and feet, so my doc confidently ruled it out. 

Unfortunately, the rash and itching got worse from there. Almost every day I feel like I’m on the phone with nurses and doctors both at my OBGYN Office and my primary care doctor. They have suggested everything under the sun you can think of: allergy meds, topical steroids, different kinds of lotion, oatmeal baths etc. I’ve tried all of them. Nothing relieves the itching. My primary care doctor even treated me for scabies, even though he admitted my rash doesn’t look like scabies... we did the treatment to be safe, and since it was harmless to treat. And, still, nothing. 

Fast forward to yesterday. The itching got so bad that I had a complete breakdown. I was itching my skin furiously, the rash was erupting everywhere, and I was so frustrated that I almost went to the ER. We live in a small town so we called ahead first to see if there was anything they could do for me before spending a small fortune for no relief. Both the doctors in labor and delivery and the ER talked on the phone with us for almost an hour and there was nothing they said they could or would do in person that I haven’t already tried. They told me to see my regular doctors in person this morning.

So, I took off of work today and luckily got an appointment with both my OB and my primary care today. My OB appointment was only slightly helpful in that he ruled out another common pregnancy rash called PUPPPs. It usually presents with extreme itching in the stomach around stretch marks. My stomach is the only place I’m not itching and I also don’t have any stretch marks. He really thinks my primary care is my best shot at a diagnosis. 

So, I’m going back to primary care in a few hours. The plan is to biopsy/scrape the rash to see if it’s something the lab can diagnose. But I probably won’t get those results for a few days, and I don’t have much hope that they can help me since it seems like every doctor in town has seen this rash and doesn’t know what to do about it. 

The rash is on my arms and legs, throat and face (mostly jawline/outer cheeks and up through my ears), on my chest, between my breasts and all over my back... mostly on the shoulder blades/upper back. It mostly looks like small, irritated red bumps, but when I itch, new bumps pop up right away that are flesh colored and larger, and if I scratch them hard enough, they seem to get a little pointed pustule on top, though I haven’t seen pus come out of any of them. They do bleed fairly quickly after itching, though. 

The only thing that seems to stop the itching is ice. If I keep an ice pack on it, it stops the itching. I itch so badly at night that I can’t sleep for more than small bits at a time. And the ice pack is the only relief that helps stop the itching long enough for me to fall back to sleep. But I can only have so much ice on me at a time before I start shivering and I can only wake up so many times throughout the night to switch ice packs. 

The only other thing I’ve noticed is that the rash is made way worse by any kind of heat. So, if I get sweaty in my sleep at night, or if I even put pressure on it (my face pressed into a pillow, a blanket on top of me, etc) it immediately starts itching. 

Obviously, if it’s some kind of infection of the skin, the lab results will show that, but I’m absolutely horrified at the thought of this rash being some kind of hormonal / immune response to pregnancy, especially considering the OBGYN has no clue what it is or how to treat it. The prospect of living this way for another few months until I deliver my baby is the most hopeless feeling. That simply can’t happen. It’s affecting my mental and physical health and I don’t want it to affect my baby. 

If anyone has any experience with this or any idea, no matter how small, please let me know! I’ll appreciate any leads right now. I feel like I’ve researched myself to death and have come up short.

"2 year old, male, former 34 weeker 2 lb 6 oz preemie, now 22 lbs.  History includes oxygen dependent on 1/4 liter for 18 months because of severe laryngomalacia, has had 3 airway surgeries (2 supraglottoplastys and 1 triple scope), and is set to have tonsils and adenoids removed as well as tubes in his ears due to obstructive sleep apnea and chronic ear infections.  He recently (in September) started going to daycare 3 times a week.  Since that time, he has maybe been healthy enough to complete 2 whole weeks of daycare.  I understand that daycare = germs, and it's normal to get 8 colds a year.  However, this kid barely gets over something to just catch something else.  And the ear infections are ridiculous, though I understand the tubes should help.  He has not been hospitalized for illness since last year, though weve gone to the ER since hes started daycare (once for croup and once for dehydration from a stomach bug).  

His surgery is not scheduled yet as I have to wait for the scheduler to call me, but it will most likely be scheduled for January.  

I have the luxury of keeping him at home with me if need be.  We started him in daycare to help with his speech and general delays he has due to prematurity, as well as general socialization and getting used to routines, etc.  My question is, given his history and with the surgery coming up, should I take him out of daycare?

He loves daycare, and we really like it too, other than the illnesses.  And of course we would either have to pay for the entire weeks he wouldn't go to keep his spot or risk losing his spot entirely, if we took him out, so just taking him out of daycare temporarily may not be an option.

"My 12yo son has some weird med history and lab results - trying to see what labs and/or referrals I should ask about at upcoming appointment.

History:
Easy pregnancy & delivery. Considered SGA at birth (in the 4th percentile). APGARs 8 and 9. Placenta had ""fatty deposit"" and umbilical cord was abnormal - more straight than twisted, one part came away for a small portion then came back in (like it made the letter P). Pathology of placenta was normal, but they did not test for CMV. Doubled birth weight by 2 months, met all milestones, no concerns other than being a really rashy baby/kid.

Age 6:
- Diagnosed with combined type ADHD.
- Diagnosed with Benign Rolandic Epilepsy, started Keppra 

Age 7: 
- Diagnosed with ESES/CSWS epilepsy, treated with Keppra and high dose Valium. Brain MRI normal
- Diagnosed with Premature Andrenarchy. Doctors blame epilepsy.
- Significant behavioral issues at home, too much anxiety at school to act out.
- Still very rashy. New rash begins: hives when exposed to cold.
- Starts taking daily Zyrtec for cold urticaria and general hay fever.

Age 9:
- Declared epilepsy free. Stopped all epilepsy meds.
- Significant behavioral issues continued. 
- Eval'd for autism. ADOS-2 score came back slightly on spectrum, but was instead diagnosed with Mixed Expressive-Receptive Language Disorder and Generalized Anxiety.
- Still very rashy

Fast forward to within the last year:
- Two random incidents of joints swelling (wrist and knee) with no known injuries. Labs for JRA came back normal.
- Complains of frequent stomach aches. Requested Celiac panel. Gliadin IGA antibodies came back slightly elevated TWICE on panels a month apart. IGG levels and the other IGA level all normal on both panels.
- Still very rashy
- Still lots of behavioral issues at home. Starts intense outpatient program and psych gives several lab orders, some of which come back abnormal:
        - Vitamin D very low (not a shock, we are in the Midwest)
        - Ferratin very low
        - Iron toward lower end of normal range
        - Transferrin Saturation level low
        - Hemoglobin low, but not too far from normal range
        - RBC low, but not too far from normal range
        - Lymphocytes are slightly high (one percent over the normal percentage range given by lab)
        - Eosinophils slightly high (one percent over the normal percentage range given by lab)

We follow up with our regular ped in two weeks and the psych has suggested we have labs redrawn to see if they come back abnormal again. I feel like there's a diagnosis that we're missing (even though it might not tie ALL issues together).  What other tests or referrals should I ask for? I am thinking Vitamin B levels and all immunoglobulins. Anything else?

Duration: 5 days

On Tuesday, I took a pregnancy at home. Test was positive. Scheduled ob appointment on Sept 10. Wednesday, I had cramping with no spotting. Thursday, I continued to cramp and went to the ER to be checked. My hcg level was 350. My ultrasound results were put as: “Possible 3 mm intrauterine gestational sac near the fundal portion of the endometrium without definite fetal pole or yolk sac. Differential possibilities would include early gestation, nonviable pregnancy versus non visualized ectopic pregnancy. Recommend continued biochemical and sonographic follow up. A small amount of free pelvic fluid may be physiologic. Heterogeneous mixed echogenicity 2.2 cm nodular structure with some peripheral blood flow in the left ovary may represent a corpus luteal cyst.”
Saturday morning, I had my hcg drawn again and the level was 434, which is about a 28% raise in around 42 hours. I’m still having back pains and slight cramping along with feeling lightheaded and winded easily. I still have not had any bleeding or cramping. Just recurrent diarrhea. I’m unsure if I should be more worried about a possible ectopic and should get checked again, or if my doctors office would have already called me if my blood levels/symptoms were warning signs to them.

"Last night my daughter (2 F) injured her right foot while twirling to show off her new dress, the toes on her right foot caught on the carpet and her foot/ankle/knee got twisted up under her as her body continued around. She immediately screamed in pain and grabbed her foot. She’s not great at communication yet but it appears that most of her pain was (and still is) to the medial portion of her right foot proximal of the great toe. She refused to bear weight on the right foot and screamed any time she tried (despite any swelling or bruising) so we took her to urgent care for some xrays to make sure there are no obvious fractures which there are not (I’ll add that the films are not great as she would not stay still).  She was splinted and sent home.

We took her to her pediatrician this morning as she still has point tenderness and will only walk on her foot in a supinated position for a few steps then gets down to crawl. Her pediatrician said that typically small fractures can’t be seen on plain films immediately following an injury so we are doing a course of rest, ice, and Motrin for a few days with a re-evaluation if she is still having pain. 

Obviously she is under the care of her pediatrician so my question is if any of the providers here have experience or insight with an injury similar in a toddler. I’m curious about what bone/ligament/structure she could have 
injured. If there is a small fracture in a metatarsal, how would it be treated?

"My son is 14months/M, born 3 months premature (so 11 months adjusted age) switched from breastmilk to formula at about 4 months old and since then he has been pretty constipated (around 10 months). Around that time our pediatrician recommended miralax, about 1 tsp daily. He is also taking 44mg Flovent 2x a day. Other than that he eats mostly formula, some cow milk (we've backed off the cow milk because of the constipation), as well as oat cereal mixed with fruits, almost always peaches and pears. And some dissolving puff/crackers. He is between 18-20lbs, very active, walks/crawls. He has never had any GI problems. He does drink some water, I'm not sure how much but probably not more than a couple ounces a day.


The miralax does fix the problem. The doc assures us that it's safe and harmless to do every day continuously. However I asked her when he will not have to take it anymore, and she said it's hard to say. She told me her own 5yo daughter has been taking it ever since 4 months of age. To me that does not sound right!!! I thought this was a temporary thing and that his body would fix it on its own. I don't want to have to give my child laxatives for years. Whenever we stop giving him miralax, his poop becomes really solid and he has a really hard time passing stools.


So I just really want to know if it is possible that my kid is or could become dependent on Miralax to poop? 

I read somewhere that a 1yo should drink about 8oz of water a day, is this correct? (I don't think he's drinking close to that amount right now.) If so, will that help the constipation?

"Hi there,

I am a 30-year-old woman, who has suffered from a long string of supposedly hormone-related symptoms since puberty. I have seen several endocrinologists, all who diagnosed me with PCOS, say they can't explain my more irregular symptoms but tell me not to worry about them, and send me on my way. I am wondering if there is the possibility of something more going on.  I weigh 55kg at present and am 161cm tall. I have fallen pregnant twice, but haven't gone through with the pregnancies. Apparently no hypothyroidism and no diabetes.

**My typical symptoms:**

*  irregular periods, sometimes painful (have been years without menstruating, currently getting period every two weeks)
* male pattern hirsutism (was classed as severe however I have had thousands of dollars of laser hair removal and is now somewhat reduced. Hair still returns on my upper back, face/neck, and buttocks irrespective of laser treatment)
* hormonal acne
* extreme mood swings and severe insomnia which appears to be cyclical
*  cysts on ovaries 
* issues with weight loss/management. At my highest, I have been 75kg. To lose weight, I have to reduce my calories to below 1200cal per day. 

**My less than typical symptoms:**

* severe melasma on the upper lip
* constant slight lactation from one breast for the past 6 years (have been tested for Prolactinoma and breast abnormalities both with negative results)
* hypertrophied inner labia (currently 6cm and apparently progressing)
* tubular breasts
* darkened patches of skin around the groin
* osteopenia diagnosed in my last BMD test, with subsequently elevated levels of blood calcium consistently
* moderate vitamin D deficiency

**'unrelated' medical issues:**

* Factor V Leiden deficiency
* congenital acetabular femoral impingement and have been recommended for surgery to repair a torn labrum
* Hypermobile joints and some skin hyperelasticity, not enough to diagnose as Ehlers-Danlos
* ADD for which I am medicated with dexamphetamine
* Long term issues with depression/suicidal tendencies, which I personally attribute to my health issues. 
* idiopathic urticaria
* scoliosis

**Treatment so far:**

* lifestyle changes, low carb diet, laser hair removal, etc.
* Implanon several times - discontinued
* spironolactone 100mg for hirsutism and acne for 2 years which led to elevated liver enzyme levels, edema, and dehydration issues. During this time my period stopped completely, but my doctors believed this was due to malnutrition when trying to lose weight. Discontinued
* **currently** metformin 200mg per day for the past 6 weeks - again to regulate the period and reduce hirsutism/acne. Was decided to try this instead of spironolactone. 

I have asked for a most recent blood test panel copy to post here - should be available tomorrow. The consensus seems to be: elevated prolactin is stress-related, most hormone levels are within 'normal' range, testosterone is only slightly elevated, consistently high levels of blood calcium isn't necessarily cause of concern. 

I understand PCOS causes the majority of my symptoms however the genital abnormalities, constant lactation, and melasma cause me to think that there could be something else going on. Could it be just a particularly unfortunate case of PCOS or something more? I understand there is probably not a treatment to reverse some of my symptoms, however, a definitive diagnosis beyond ""it's probably related to your PCOS"" would be of much relief to me.

Finally, I appreciate whoever has taken the time to read this post.

(discontinued) Adderall regular 10mg up to 3x a day weaned off over about a month

I have a history of anxiety, adhd, severe depression, post partum depression from my last pregnancy. 

Current conditions 26 weeks pregnant (due in July) and have been on pelvic rest and light duty since late December due to bleeding and losing blood clots. OBGYN checked thoroughly and ultrasounds show health cervix, no issues, and a visual examination of my cervix and vaginal walls are intact and no tearing, so it was ruled a ""leaky blood vessel"". Amniotic fluid is great, and anatomy scan showed a very healthy, organs all in place with good blood flow, baby boy. 

Bit of back story - I found out I was pregnant in December when I was further along than I realized because I was still having a ""period"" (the spotting and bleeding I was experiencing that ultimately put me on pelvic rest a few weeks later). Okay so I have been on Prozac since before I gave birth to my second child in Nov 2016, I want to say I started it in late September because my depression was making me go a little crazy. Our home flooded in Louisiana so add that to the stress of a new baby. That baby did great, and I stayed on my low dose of Prozac for almost a year claiming things were fine but was really dealing with serious PPD. I finally stepped up and got help and since then I am now up to 60mg of Prozac daily. My insurance does not cover any name adhd medications or XR, so I have been on 10 MG Adderall up to 3x a day for about 2ish years. 

When I found out I was pregnant, I didn't want to just stop taking the Adderall so I decided it was best for me to slowly wean off. In the past if I abruptly stopped I had some really angry withdrawal symptoms, so I talked it over with my OB and Pysch and while understanding the risks, I weaned off much slower than I maybe should have. But I'm finally off of it. However after what happened during my last pregnancy I felt it was safer for me to stay on that treatment, because if I tried to do without medication again I was terrified of what I'd do to myself or my unborn baby. I had full support from both doctors. Well, the support that is tied with their cautions of course.

Okay so I stopped taking the Adderall around January/February-ish, but still on Prozac. I know both can cause the baby to withdraw once he's born. How long would the Adderall be effective in his system if I stopped taking it in January and presumably go full term to July, is there a risk he would still have any in his system to cause him to withdraw? Would the Prozac exacerbate anything or bc the Prozac is still in my system so it would be in his, would that affect how the Adderall leaves? And with the Adderall being a low dose to begin with then wean down to, does that make a difference as to whether he may withdraw at all from it? How many weeks does it take to clear their system in utero? I've seen reports that some women are going into preterm labor when they got sick so if I somehow deliver early could the Adderall still be there? 

I figure there's a chance he will withdraw from the Prozac, and I feel ashamed I still have to take it but I can't put my family through that again. My 7 year old son was terrified of me for weeks after. I just know amphetamines can be worse when it comes to withdrawing in infants so to combine the two now is really scaring me. Thank you for any help.

Okay so I have been on Prozac since before I gave birth to my second child in Nov 2016, I want to say I started it in late September because my depression was making me go a little crazy. Our home flooded in Louisiana so add that to the stress of a new baby. That baby did great, and I stayed on my low dose of Prozac for almost a year claiming things were fine but was really dealing with serious PPD. I finally stepped up and got help and since then I am now up to 60mg of Prozac daily. My insurance does not cover any name adhd medications or XR, so I have been on 10 MG Adderall up to 3x a day for about 2ish years. 

When I found out I was pregnant, I didn't want to just stop taking the Adderall so I decided it was best for me to slowly wean off. In the past if I abruptly stopped I had some really angry withdrawal symptoms, so I talked it over with my OB and Pysch and while understanding the risks, I weaned off much slower than I maybe should have. But I'm finally off of it. However after what happened during my last pregnancy I felt it was safer for me to stay on that treatment, because if I tried to do without medication again I was terrified of what I'd do to myself or my unborn baby. I had full support from both doctors. Well, the support that is tied with their cautions of course.

Okay so I stopped taking the Adderall around January/February-ish, but still on Prozac. I know both can cause the baby to withdraw once he's born. How long would the Adderall be effective in his system if I stopped taking it in January and presumably go full term to July, is there a risk he would still have any in his system to cause him to withdraw? Would the Prozac exacerbate anything or bc the Prozac is still in my system so it would be in his, would that affect how the Adderall leaves? And with the Adderall being a low dose to begin with then wean down to, does that make a difference as to whether he may withdraw at all from it? How many weeks does it take to clear their system in utero? I've seen reports that some women are going into preterm labor when they got sick so if I somehow deliver early could the Adderall still be there? 

I figure there's a chance he will withdraw from the Prozac, and I feel ashamed I still have to take it but I can't put my family through that again. My 7 year old son was terrified of me for weeks after. I just know amphetamines can be worse when it comes to withdrawing in infants so to combine the two now is really scaring me. Thank you for any help.

"My 12yo son has some weird med history and lab results - trying to see what labs and/or referrals I should ask about at upcoming appointment.

History:
Easy pregnancy & delivery. Considered SGA at birth (in the 4th percentile). APGARs 8 and 9. Placenta had ""fatty deposit"" and umbilical cord was abnormal - more straight than twisted, one part came away for a small portion then came back in (like it made the letter P). Pathology of placenta was normal, but they did not test for CMV. Doubled birth weight by 2 months, met all milestones, no concerns other than being a really rashy baby/kid.

Age 6:
- Diagnosed with combined type ADHD.
- Diagnosed with Benign Rolandic Epilepsy, started Keppra 

Age 7: 
- Diagnosed with ESES/CSWS epilepsy, treated with Keppra and high dose Valium. Brain MRI normal
- Diagnosed with Premature Andrenarchy. Doctors blame epilepsy.
- Significant behavioral issues at home, too much anxiety at school to act out.
- Still very rashy. New rash begins: hives when exposed to cold.
- Starts taking daily Zyrtec for cold urticaria and general hay fever.

Age 9:
- Declared epilepsy free. Stopped all epilepsy meds.
- Significant behavioral issues continued. 
- Eval'd for autism. ADOS-2 score came back slightly on spectrum, but was instead diagnosed with Mixed Expressive-Receptive Language Disorder and Generalized Anxiety.
- Still very rashy

Fast forward to within the last year:
- Two random incidents of joints swelling (wrist and knee) with no known injuries. Labs for JRA came back normal.
- Complains of frequent stomach aches. Requested Celiac panel. Gliadin IGA antibodies came back slightly elevated TWICE on panels a month apart. IGG levels and the other IGA level all normal on both panels.
- Still very rashy
- Still lots of behavioral issues at home. Starts intense outpatient program and psych gives several lab orders, some of which come back abnormal:
        - Vitamin D very low (not a shock, we are in the Midwest)
        - Ferratin very low
        - Iron toward lower end of normal range
        - Transferrin Saturation level low
        - Hemoglobin low, but not too far from normal range
        - RBC low, but not too far from normal range
        - Lymphocytes are slightly high (one percent over the normal percentage range given by lab)
        - Eosinophils slightly high (one percent over the normal percentage range given by lab)

We follow up with our regular ped in two weeks and the psych has suggested we have labs redrawn to see if they come back abnormal again. I feel like there's a diagnosis that we're missing (even though it might not tie ALL issues together).  What other tests or referrals should I ask for? I am thinking Vitamin B levels and all immunoglobulins. Anything else?

"Background info:

When I was in high school, I was in a car wreck that I should not have walked away from. I had lateral compression and vertical shear pelvic fractures that were treated by open reduction and internal fixation, i.e. two screws through my pubic symphysis and one through left iliac.

I am 14 weeks and 3 days pregnant today with our first kiddo. I’ve had a total of 4 miscarriages before this pregnancy. I have a retroverted uterus, along with the abdominal scar tissue you would expect from having the surgery discussed above. I don’t smoke or drink, my blood pressure is 116/71, I am 30 years old, and my BMI is normal. I am 5’9” and weighed 9lb 2oz at birth. My husband is 6’1” and weighed 10lb 1oz at birth. Large babies run in both of our families, and everyone is tall. I am O negative, hubs is A positive.

I’m including all of that because I honestly want to know if my knee jerk reaction/gut feeling is accurate and reasonable based specifically on my situation.

I had my first OB visit at 9 weeks and the doctor was a tiny bit dopey, but whatever. I don’t have a choice who my doctor is because my health insurance is through the military, and I’m being treated at the Naval hospital on base. I told her I just wanted to do the best thing for the baby given my past medical history. Whatever the best thing is, I would do. I’ve had more than one doctor tell me vaginal birth isn’t in the cards because of the pelvic fixation. The OB and I discussed that surgery, and I asked what the delivery plan would be, specifically if I would be scheduled for a C-section, or they would wait until I went into labor and then perform one, etc. She told me “we know that the best thing for the baby is a natural, non-medicated, vaginal birth,” and I asked her how that would be possible to accomplish in my case since my pelvis is fixed. She told me that they could “try like a trial of labor first” before doing the C-section, because “sometimes the baby might not be too big to fit.” My initial reaction was thinking that that seems like a completely unnecessary risk! I didn’t argue with her because it didn’t seem worth it at the time.

She has since done other somewhat infuriating things, such as forgetting more than once to order the lab work we’ve discussed at the same time, which means that I have to go back to the lab days later for the forgotten panel or two after the initial draw. Ignoring the potential inaccuracies this may create in the various results, it’s kind of a pretty big inconvenience to have to keep going back because something was left off. The only reason the forgotten panels eventually get ordered is because I’ll look at the lab order while I’m in the lab and realize she forgot to include a test, like a liver and kidney function panel she wanted to have done, and sometimes the tech catches it because the lab order doesn’t make sense. Then they or I have to try to get ahold of her and wait for her to put the order in, usually days later. I asked to have nuchal thickness screening done with the bloodwork, and her nurse told me that they don’t routinely order those, despite the particular screening lab work not being as accurate without it. another time, it took two weeks to get ahold of her to remind her that the test she promised she would order the day of my appointment still hadn’t been put in. There have been quite a few similar incidents since she has been providing my care.

So again, my question is basically is it reasonable to be wondering about her competency? Is her “birth plan” appropriate? Advice?

TL;DR: I had internal pelvic fixations after a car wreck. Am now pregnant with first kid after history of complications, doc wants me to try to deliver non-medicated, vaginally first before performing a C-section. Same doc has made a series of mistakes so far that worry me that even if I agreed to a trial of labor, complications or a crisis that came up during said labor wouldn’t be quickly/appropriately recognized or addressed.

"This pregnancy has been hellishly complicated. Check my post history for more details but long story short: HG so severe it requires a Zofran pump and weekly IV fluids, gestational diabetes with fasting numbers that we keep chasing with higher doses of insulin but can’t get under control, slow growth turned big belly and polyhydramnios, chronic hypertension. Yeah, all the fun shit. 

I’ve had an irritable uterus since about 25 weeks. I’ve had multiple trips to L&D due to consistent, timetable contractions with no cervical change. I’ve had several instances of bright red spotting. The BH became baseline, I learned to ignore them because I had serial cervical checks that weren’t showing any change even when having contractions every 2-3 minutes. 

On Sunday, I picked up my toddler when he woke up from his nap. He weighs about 34lb. Immediately after doing it I got a sharp, shooting pain in my lower abdomen. I then began having consistent BH and intermittent sharp cramps in the abdomen. I figured I had just pulled a muscle or my round ligaments and just took it very easy the rest of the day. 

Monday, the BH had never stopped. The cramps were still intermittent but got sharper. I also began having a burning pain in the side of my bump that felt like something tearing. I tried all the tricks - chugged water, took a warm bath, laid down. By 5:30pm when my husband got off work, it was still happening and I was having some more bright red spotting. Baby was still moving but I called L&D and they told me to come in to be safe.

The monitors picked up pretty consistent contractions. Usually my BH are tiny little hills, but some of these were big old spikes. Baby looked great. They checked my cervix and it was mid position, soft, 25% effaced but closed. They monitored me for 2 hours and my cervix didn’t change so they basically told me as long as I’m not dilating, there’s not anything they can do. The doctor did tell me that my uterus is measuring 6 weeks ahead and that this puts me at risk for preterm labor because it can make my body think I’m further along than I am. 

So if I’m not dilating, why am I worried? Because last week when I had spotting I got a cervical check. And it was described as hard, long, and closed. So within a week it has softened up and began to efface. I’m only 30 weeks. I’ve had a gut feeling from the start that this pregnancy was going to end early. Delivery is currently planned for 37 weeks and I’m afraid we won’t make it there. I have polyhydramnios and am terrified my water will break at home, the cord will prolapse and my baby will die or be brain damaged. That’s not paranoia - it’s a very real risk with poly. When I had it with my son, I was told if my water broke at home I was to immediately get on all fours and call 911. I’ve dealt with the shitshow that is this pregnancy very well - I’ve only cried twice, even when I was in excruciating pain from pulled muscles from vomiting 70 times in one day.

"White female, 163, 70 kilos (currently 6 months pregnant), non smoker. Dad suffers from bradychardia- and has a pacemaker (fitted when he was 55). Uncle passed away at 50 from a heart attack in his sleep.

&#x200B;

2 years ago I suffered from anxiety and stress. I remember waking up at the time with my heart rate shooting up (then found out it was going 160 + when it happened), sweating, feeling dizzy. I went to the ER who did tests such as EKG, XRAY etc and said that the heart rate was fast but regular- and said it was anxiety related. One EKG done at the GP surgery came back as atrial flutter so I went back to hospital- the consultant again said that the GP read it wrong because the heart rate was so fast but that it was totally regular and fine. I decided to trust her- she gave me beta blockers that I never used. I decided to work on my anxiety as a result and got better.

&#x200B;

My heart rate can still shoot up to 160 if I'm panicked- so anytime a nurse or GP takes my pulse, if I have to do public speaking, etc. It comes back down nicely as soon as I breathe and calm down. Some nurses freak out and say this is REALLY high to just be anxiety related- but then see I went to hospital etc so just leave it.

&#x200B;

My slight worry is that I noticed that my heart rate was 176 going up stairs (they are quite steep), when it was 110 when I was walking (quite fast). Is this normal? Again, the heart rate drops back down quickly and nicely within minutes. No chest pain experienced. Am I just out of shape then?

I also noticed that my heart rate went from 90 to 120 just standing up- not sure how much I trust my fitbit but could it be PTOS? None of the GPs mentioned it to me.

&#x200B;

I'm currently pregnant with my first baby and was assured by the midwives that it would be fine during labour- my main worry was around the epidural and whether my heart could cope with this? and cope with labour in general? I'm just worried it will be crazy high and that they will give me an emergency c section as a result?

&#x200B;

"I’m F but never been pregnant and am not too familiar with the hormonal changes and stages. I have now had 2 different pregnant friends (who I had fallen out of touch with, so much so that I didn’t even know they were pregnant) reach out to me in their last 4-6 weeks of pregnancy to reconnect. They are both women I’ve know for 25+ years and used to be super close best friends with, but have just kind of grown apart in recent years.

Is it a known hormonal thing to feel emotional and want to reconnect, feel close to people, etc. or is it just that these pregnant ladies have huge milestones coming up and they want to share it with everyone? Maybe a mix of both?",40.0,5.300296640431787,40.0,0.021,0.772,0.206,0.9804,669,2,0.10193679918450561,0.8400000000000001
"White female, 163, 70 kilos (currently 6 months pregnant), non smoker. Dad suffers from bradychardia- and has a pacemaker (fitted when he was 55). Uncle passed away at 50 from a heart attack in his sleep.

&#x200B;

2 years ago I suffered from anxiety and stress. I remember waking up at the time with my heart rate shooting up (then found out it was going 160 + when it happened), sweating, feeling dizzy. I went to the ER who did tests such as EKG, XRAY etc and said that the heart rate was fast but regular- and said it was anxiety related. One EKG done at the GP surgery came back as atrial flutter so I went back to hospital- the consultant again said that the GP read it wrong because the heart rate was so fast but that it was totally regular and fine. I decided to trust her- she gave me beta blockers that I never used. I decided to work on my anxiety as a result and got better.

&#x200B;

My heart rate can still shoot up to 160 if I'm panicked- so anytime a nurse or GP takes my pulse, if I have to do public speaking, etc. It comes back down nicely as soon as I breathe and calm down. Some nurses freak out and say this is REALLY high to just be anxiety related- but then see I went to hospital etc so just leave it.

&#x200B;

My slight worry is that I noticed that my heart rate was 176 going up stairs (they are quite steep), when it was 110 when I was walking (quite fast). Is this normal? Again, the heart rate drops back down quickly and nicely within minutes. No chest pain experienced. Am I just out of shape then?

I also noticed that my heart rate went from 90 to 120 just standing up- not sure how much I trust my fitbit but could it be PTOS? None of the GPs mentioned it to me.

&#x200B;

I'm currently pregnant with my first baby and was assured by the midwives that it would be fine during labour- my main worry was around the epidural and whether my heart could cope with this? and cope with labour in general? I'm just worried it will be crazy high and that they will give me an emergency c section as a result?

"31 female, white
About 200 pounds, 5'1.
Never smoker, occasional drinker but not since AI got pregnant.
Medications are: Prozac 60mg, ambien 2.5mg-5 MG as needed for sleep. Tylenol as needed, famotadine and tums as needed (but daily almost), and I've had to take vistaril 25mg for a break through anxiety attack a few weeks ago. (discontinued) Adderall regular 10mg up to 3x a day weaned off over about a month

I have a history of anxiety, adhd, severe depression, post partum depression from my last pregnancy. 

Current conditions 26 weeks pregnant (due in July) and have been on pelvic rest and light duty since late December due to bleeding and losing blood clots. OBGYN checked thoroughly and ultrasounds show health cervix, no issues, and a visual examination of my cervix and vaginal walls are intact and no tearing, so it was ruled a ""leaky blood vessel"". Amniotic fluid is great, and anatomy scan showed a very healthy, organs all in place with good blood flow, baby boy. 

Bit of back story - I found out I was pregnant in December when I was further along than I realized because I was still having a ""period"" (the spotting and bleeding I was experiencing that ultimately put me on pelvic rest a few weeks later). Okay so I have been on Prozac since before I gave birth to my second child in Nov 2016, I want to say I started it in late September because my depression was making me go a little crazy. Our home flooded in Louisiana so add that to the stress of a new baby. That baby did great, and I stayed on my low dose of Prozac for almost a year claiming things were fine but was really dealing with serious PPD. I finally stepped up and got help and since then I am now up to 60mg of Prozac daily. My insurance does not cover any name adhd medications or XR, so I have been on 10 MG Adderall up to 3x a day for about 2ish years. 

When I found out I was pregnant, I didn't want to just stop taking the Adderall so I decided it was best for me to slowly wean off. In the past if I abruptly stopped I had some really angry withdrawal symptoms, so I talked it over with my OB and Pysch and while understanding the risks, I weaned off much slower than I maybe should have. But I'm finally off of it. However after what happened during my last pregnancy I felt it was safer for me to stay on that treatment, because if I tried to do without medication again I was terrified of what I'd do to myself or my unborn baby. I had full support from both doctors. Well, the support that is tied with their cautions of course.

Okay so I stopped taking the Adderall around January/February-ish, but still on Prozac. I know both can cause the baby to withdraw once he's born. How long would the Adderall be effective in his system if I stopped taking it in January and presumably go full term to July, is there a risk he would still have any in his system to cause him to withdraw? Would the Prozac exacerbate anything or bc the Prozac is still in my system so it would be in his, would that affect how the Adderall leaves? And with the Adderall being a low dose to begin with then wean down to, does that make a difference as to whether he may withdraw at all from it? How many weeks does it take to clear their system in utero? I've seen reports that some women are going into preterm labor when they got sick so if I somehow deliver early could the Adderall still be there? 

I figure there's a chance he will withdraw from the Prozac, and I feel ashamed I still have to take it but I can't put my family through that again. My 7 year old son was terrified of me for weeks after. I just know amphetamines can be worse when it comes to withdrawing in infants so to combine the two now is really scaring me. Thank you for any help.

"Background: I was prescribed 10 days of Clarithromycin during a visit to my ENT today (due to suspected tonsillitis, only one side is infected). He said it was important to start immediately but didn't note that it could conflict with my Pravastatin regimen (which was listed on my recent medication list).

I was just notified of the possible negative interaction by my pharmacist when I picked up the prescription.  However, I can't reach the doctor and won't get an answer until Monday at the earliest.

 I have read that I can take the Clarithromycin as long as I pause the Pravastatin but I am not sure how long the statin stays in my system. Should I wait a few days?

Any advice from a physician or PA would be greatly appreciated.

I am diagnosed by evaluation hypomanic bipolar, severe depression, anxiety and insomnia (not related) and, not PTSD/ not an ""official term"" diagnosis, but I have ""trauma based coping inability"", apparently just long-term mental shit from traumatic situations that mess with me (I have never heard it beforehand)
In July, I was put on 10mg adderall XR after trying a non stimulant that caused severe side effects. 2 months later he put me on 15mg Adderall XR. A month later, 30mg Adderall XR and talked about continuing raising my dosage and taking an afternoon IR when we hit my correct IR dose. I was in college and had 2 separate medical issues and per instructor and medical advice, dropped out because of issues. 
Immediately after, doctor began expressing the idea of taking me off of ADHD medication altogether because, word for word, ""I don't think patients should be taking stimulants if they aren't in school because that is the only excuse to need to regularly focus""

I have had my ADHD symptoms since as far back as I can remember but grew up with medical neglect, wasn't diagnosed (it was a total surprise) until December 2018). Doctor would not medicate me initially, then put me on a non stimulant and I had severe side effects, and then prescribed me Adderall XR. There is no high to my medication after my first week of being on it when I started at 10mg (in July) for the first time ever. While each dosage increase has shown medically/mentally recognized progress by my doctor, and I have no heart problems or current/past drug addictions and my blood pressure is freaking amazing, he refuses to continue adjusting my dosage any higher to my ideal dosage like we previously talked about BECAUSE I am not currently in school (had to drop out for medical reasons he diagnosed that inhibited my ability to attend, he also acknowledges and supports/suggested my dropping out but refuses to write administration a letter that would excuse my debt, saying he refuses because ""education is not his profession"" , can't get back into school without the letter unless I pay $1500)

I'm on 30mg Adderall XR once a day immediately in the morning, a dose he says he prescribes to children so ""it's no wonder it isn't working anymore"" and ""I just personally don't think you need it enough anymore since you aren't in school"". Progress growth has stopped. He prescribed 2 more months of my prescription at 30mg XR and then will take me off of it.

I work 5 days a week, I have a child, I have daily tasks, I have classes while not being enrolled to make up for my dropping out (probational classes I have to complete required by my program dean to be able to re-enroll after my debt is resolved), I need to normally socialize daily (ADHD severely affected that), it has not had any side effects on my Bipolar.
I have for the first time been able to clearly function normally, and focus, and my brain is no longer a clouded ""dazed"" confused mess.

"Me: 27F, 5'0, 185lbs, no history of significant medical issues. No recent falls or head trauma

Since Christmas, I've had a host of weird symptoms. Nausea, some confusion, becoming overheated easily, excessive fatigue, and some constipation issues. When the nausea surfaces, I have this weird back of head pain that permeates down into my neck and upper back. It's not a headache but more feels like I've pulled a muscle. It's dull and more annoying than being actually painful. It usually happens in the mornings. No, I'm not pregnant (doctor tested me twice and I tested myself once 😅)

On Christmas, the symptoms were really bad to where I didn't eat at all and did a lot of dry heaving into the toilet. I slept a lot too that day. I got a little better the next couple of days to where I could eat but then that following Sunday night after Christmas, I was vomiting and had diarrhea. Same weird head pain too. I only vomited twice but had the chills and a fever of 100.8 at my highest. The duration of symptoms lasted 48 hours. My husband, two days later, then exhibited similar symptoms (chills, fever, vomiting and diarrhea) and we both chalked it up to bring the stomach flu. My husband recovered completely within 36 hours. I got better too, but my nausea, weird head pain, becoming overheated and some constipation persisted to some degree so I saw my PCP at the end of that week (Jan 9 actually). Blood work showed markers for possibly an acute viral infection and my doctor advised me that if symptoms persisted, I head to the ER. That weekend, I felt better than I had since before Christmas so I didn't go to the ER. However, that following Tuesday (Jan 14), my symptoms of nausea and head pain (decreased but still present) returned and then subsided by the end of the day so I didn't call my doctor or go to the ER. I felt good the rest of the week until the following Tuesday (Jan 21), where I felt the same symptoms again, albeit the head pain even less so this time. I did call my doctor this time and she advised that I go to an urgent care. At the urgent care facility, I got checked for the third time for pregnancy (since I didn't have my period, which should have happened the week prior; negative again). My urine test though showed signs of a UTI, which I'm currently being treated for with antibiotics.

I haven't had symptoms since 1/21. Could a UTI have really caused my month-long weird symptoms? Anything else it might be? I didn't have my usual symptoms of UTI which, before when I had them and it's been awhile, I would only get the urgency to pee a lot. I'm really hoping that the UTI was the culprit all along and that my symptoms don't resurface. Also, I'm thinking that having the stomach flu in the midst of this weird illness was just a coincidence (my mom said she had it before me, so I probably just caught it from her)

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated :)",14.0,8.907980428358343,14.0,0.116,0.801,0.083,-0.9461,2915,2,1.397421997349717,1.624

5'4, 120 pounds

social drinker (1-2 beers or glasses of wine, twice a week or so)

diet: thanks to my mediterranean husband who loves to cook, I eat a lot of food considered to be in the med diet- lots of olive oil, tomatoes, salads, lentils, olives, veggies, fish, chicken and turkey. When I do eat red meat (1-2 times a week?) it could be pork or beef, but usually a good quality one from a fresh market. However, let's be honest, I am still eating sweets or fried food from time to time. I drink espresso every day in the morning with 2% milk, I sometimes have a small glass of milk in the evening. I eat regular bread, cheese, etc. I haven't tried cutting any particular food groups out of my diet (no doctor has asked me about my diet.)

living in Spain (with both public and private insurance)

I am looking for advice on how I could take a more holistic approach on my health issues, and whether they are likely connected. Currently, I have visited dermatologists (3 different ones to get multiple opinions) and other general doctors for these issues, but when I seek advice on **how to treat the ROOT of the problem**, and whether anxiety is likely the root, it seems that my doctors have been reluctant to discuss anything outside of their specialty. **Can anyone suggest the type of specialist that I could visit that would take a look at my health issues more holistically?** I am hoping to find an area in medicine that would look at my diet, lifestyle, stress and anxiety management, etc. in relation to the health issues I am experiencing. I have public and private healthcare here, so I should be able to locate something, my problem is that I really don't know where to search.

Additionally, does anyone have a suggestion for an alternative to Accutane that has fewer side effects? Before this flare up happened, my husband and I were planning on starting to try to get pregnant soon. Obviously, we wouldn't be able to do that anytime soon if I follow this treatment. How is cystic acne affected by pregnancy hormones? :)

A brief explanation of my medical issues:

**Acne**: I have had acne since I was a teenager, but it became cystic in my early 20s. It shows up on my chin/jawline and cheeks only. Between the ages of 24 and 27, I have had three separate severe flare ups and was prescribed antibiotics each time by my dermatologist. During each of the 3 flare ups, I was taking antibiotics for about 3 months (yikes!) This third flare up, which I am currently still going through, has not responded much to oral antibiotics OR the same antibiotic applied in a topical tonic solution. Additionally, the third flare up seems different than the first two- I have acne in my T-zone as well and on my nose, a few on my forehead, etc. Basically all over and lots of small, hard ones in addition to several deeper cysts. Now, my dermatologist wants me to start taking Accutane, but I am worried about starting such an intense treatment.

**Bruxism/TMJ**: This is something that I have struggled with on and off since my early 20s. I grind my teeth at night during certain stressful periods. Recently, during this acne flare up, I realized that the soreness and stiffness in my jaw was not going away for several days, so I went to an otolaryngologist who advised me to take Valium 5 mg for 5 nights to relax my jaw. This helped out a lot, and for the past two months I have taken the Valium a couple of times before bed when I have tension in my jaw.

**Anxiety**: its something that runs in my family, I have never gone to a therapist about it and mostly just deal with it on my own (going to yoga, exercising, deep breathing, stretching, resting, hot bath, etc.) I sometimes feel my skin on my cheeks or neck getting hot when I notice I am getting anxious. I also feel that I am keeping tension in my body, in my jaw and hands gripping too hard on something, etc. I am an elementary teacher, so high stress job, and am living in a different country where I am still struggling to learn the language- a lot of my anxiety comes from situations where I need to speak in Spanish or times when I feel like an outsider here. Socially, if I am out with friends/coworkers who speak English, I feel much more comfortable and become much more outgoing.",14.0,9.76619394963324,14.0,0.066,0.866,0.068,0.7406,4315,4,0.9704455227172475,0.924

Primary Complaint: I found a hard painless lump on the left of my urethral opening. It displaces the location of my urethral opening to the far right.

Duration: Uncertain, possibly between 1 and 7 days days. Discovered last night early this morning 12/1/19

Existing medical issues: obesity, irregular periods (one period about every 3-5 months)

Medications: None currently. Last took hydrocodone for one week gallbladder removal in  April 2019.

Drink: On special occasion (holidays) and never in between. Apx 2 - 4 12oz beers per year. Last drank on thanks giving. One 12oz 5% alcohol craft beer.

Smoke: Never. Irregular smoke last smoked 4 years ago.

Drugs: Never. Last smoked weed and took unprescribed xanax 5 years ago. 

Description:
I noticed there was a lump on the side of my urethral opening early this morning. It doesn't hurt at all and I have no idea how long it has been there. It most likely wasnt there longer than one week but it is possible since its painless. 

Other than that my last sexual contact was over 3 years ago and I was tested for STDs after more than once. I have had a normal vaginal birth, full term with an epidural and natural tear. In the past 2 years I have gained 60lbs.

I was breast feeding exclusively for 2 years up until august 2019. My period was nonexistent for 2 years because of the breast feeding. Came back monthly for 2 cycles and then disappeared until October and continued again with a regular cycle (30 days).

The lump by my urethral opening extends from under my labia minora to the urethral opening its maybe about the side of a dime and is round like a ball. I press it and it does not hurt and it is very smooth. I cannot feel it from inside my vagina. It is so large it has displaced my urethral opening from the center to the far right almost tucked under my right labia minora.

My cervix is very low but I have a short vaginal cavity and it hasnt been abnormal for me to feel it this low before. I don't feel anything I hadn't felt before on the inside. 

Is this something I should be concerned about or is it one of those things that just happens sometimes and resolves on it's own. Right now I'm worried just because any lumps kind of worry me but at the same time it doesn't hurt so I'm not really sure if I should be co concerned. Should I be?

As the title states, I missed an entire week of bc pills. I don't bother to take the last week since they are the ""fakes"" and I guess I preemptively stopped this month. I have no idea how I didn't catch that, but I did have my period, normal and on time in relation to the last pill taken. 

I started a new card today and when I pulled out my old one, with a row of placebo pills AND a row of real pills left, i realized my mistake.

" 25F, 5'3 170lbs, Non smoker/non drinker/THC consumer via edibles from a legal dispensary. Medical history: 21-hydroxylase deficiency, PMDD, flu turned bronchitis. Medications and drugs in the past 30 days: generic Seasonique while skipping placebo week and jumping into the next pack, Albuterol inhaler, THC edibles, Nyquil, Mucinex

I take birth control continuously to prevent periods. I have PMDD, and the hormonal changes during my period and right before it frequently put me in the psych ward. With generic Seasonique and skipping ""placebo week"" as directed by an OBGYN, I have successfully avoided both menstruating and pregnancy since February 2019.

This week, it was time for a new 90-day pack. I was given the same meds, same doses, but a new generic label. I have never missed a pill and I typically take them about 24 hours apart. Last night, I got light bleeding along with lower back aches, abdominal cramps, and after already being extra stressed since Sunday. This is when I'd be getting my period if I was taking placebo week, but it shouldn't have happened.

So what DID happen? If the meds are truly the same, why am I responding to them differently than before? Most importantly, is there a chance that this new label may not work at all on me despite it having the same meds and doses in them? Since I'm sexually active, does this mean continuing this med as a contraceptive puts me at risk of a pregnancy, even though the only difference is it's called Daysee instead of Seasonique?

"I have never posted here before and am fairly new to reddit and this thread. On Mobile. I gave birth last week on Wednesday and had a beautiful little girl.  I was in labor for 3 days before needing an emergency c section. I wanted to breastfeed her one because I wanted to but also because I promised my husband that I would breastfeed.  I wasn't and am always sick so we wanted to try to help her with that. Unfortunately she doesn't latch. After a week of bottle feeding and generally pissing her off by try in to get her to latch we went to see a lactation specialist who gave me a shield to try. She latches to it but with much difficulty and will only try for a short period of time, so has to be finished by a bottle.  My problem other than dealing with the guilt of failing my promise is the clots. I have very large breasts. Before pregnancy was a G cup. I have 2-3 clots in each breast with the smallest being the size of a gumball and the largest the size of a orange. The orange sized one is now infected and while I am doing everything I can think of to help I cant get it to go away.  I use hot/cold compress, showers,  immersing whole breast, massage both by hand and percussion massager.  I still cant help it. Failing all of this is making me feel depressed.

"Backstory: It started when I went to take my tampon out but realized its not inside. The forgetful person that I am, I knew I must have taken it out earlier. And rightly so. But while I was probing, my fingers caught on to something unusual. It was a line of bumps on my cervix. It felt exactly how a tampon string feels. So my first instinct was that I had retained a piece of tampon string inside. Upon closer inspection though, I felt 4 distinct bumps. That was clearly not a string. I panicked and went to the doctor for a pelvic exam. My pap smear came back normal. My doctor said they were just harmless follicles probably formed during child birth/delivery. I told the doctor I never had a normal delivery. I had a C-section some 11 years ago and 2 D&C’s for miscarriage. My doctor was still unconcerned. But I am worried.

My cat (100% indoor cat, never been outside, but overdue for rabies vaccine, all other animals in home UTD) clawed the shit out of my arm, profuse bleeding. The dorsal side of my hand got it the worst, and there is a puncture wound on the fleshy part between index finger and thumb. This part swelled up very quickly (less than 2 minutes) to the size of a ping pong ball chopped in half. Immediately put it on ice and rushed to ER. ER doc said the swelling was likely some minor internal bleeding, as it had gone down but spread out and begun to bruise. He also began to advise “following vaccine” and was interrupted mid-sentence by two GSWs across the hall, and understandably, rushed to assist.

"Hey everyone. My first post in this forum. I am [23F], 5’3 and currently 197lbs, not the healthiest, and have been on psychiatric medications for a long time. I am also currently 30 weeks pregnant. Not looking for treatment, just looking for answers on what the hell this migraine could be. 

Health conditions: type 1 diabetic since 9mo old, 30 weeks pregnant with a healthy but larger percentile baby (80th); two compression fractures in my lowest vertebrae/chronic back pain, gastroparesis and a minor traumatic brain injury from a horseback riding accident when I was 16. Complex PTSD and anxiety/depression, BPD traits. My doctor believes I got PANDAS from strept throat when I was 12 as well. 

Meds: Wellbutrin xl 450mg, lithium carbonate 150mg 2x a day, humalog insulin (dose varies by insulin pump daily), reglan, Zofran, tums, prenatal vitamin, fish oil vitamin. 
I also drink between 8-11 17oz water bottles a day, so certainly not dehydrated. 

So. I’ve only had this migraine once before, about a year ago. I got very stressed out and suddenly it felt like I got sucker punched in the entire left side of my head right behind my temple. The pain lasted 1 1/2 - 2 weeks last time, and was debilitating, and no one could figure it out, and just threw me on Tylenol with codeine which didn’t even help. Headache doesn’t hurt if I keep my head down, basically chin to neck looking at the floor. But if I lift my head to look eye level or above, it’s like excruciating shocks of pain go through the top and around the back of my head, but not completely to the right side. Sometimes down my left sinus too, which is sometimes accompanied by the scent of blood in my left nostril. 

It’s really weird and painful and sucks, and randomly happened again yesterday and now I am suffering and praying that it doesn’t last as long as the last time last year. I find myself irritable too, but who’s to say if it’s only from the pain, or being 30 weeks pregnant with chronic back pain too. My pregnancy has been very stressful because of social reasons/drama, but the past few days have actually been really nice and relaxing so I’m not sure if stress triggered it this time. 
I called my OB and they weren’t sure what it was but told me all they can tell me to do is take Tylenol, and if I need stronger meds to go to the ER or L&D. 
When I was in the ER last year because of it, they did an MRI or CT scan because I told them that occasionally I would smell blood in my left nostril when I would lift my head with this migraine. They told me they couldn’t see anything like DVT/stroke or anything, which I guess was what they were worried about. 

I should also add that when I was 16 and had the horseback riding fall/accident, I was thrown from the horse across the full sized ring and landed/impact on my left side and then rolled until I hit the fence at the other end. Brutal basically. So I landed on my left hip, shoulder, and side of my head (in a very expensive safety helmet that cracked in half from the impact). I’ve noticed throughout my pregnancy that sleeping on my left side has been painful because of my hip and shoulder, but never my head.

What the hell is this migraine? 
It really sucks and nothing seems to make it better. Pain medications are limited for me because of pregnancy and being on lithium.

I have had no miscarriages, the only time I have been pregnant was successful, I had hyperemesis gravidarum and she was born at 35+4 (4-5 weeks premature. It’s a real estimate though because my periods were so out of whack the doctors basically guessed when implantation etc occurred based on the size of the embryo). 

I breastfed for 2.5 years. Since stopping breastfeeding my cycles have been very consistent. I experience changes in cervical mucus, libido, acne, and bowel movements like clockwork every cycle which is something I’ve never experienced before.

"I was induced for labor in January and after a couple of days and “failure to progress” I had an emergency c-section. Baby is healthy and great. While I was in labor I had an epidural, so after the c-section the nurse assigned to me said she would remove the epidural catheter from my spine. 

However, it got stuck and only part of the catheter came out. The doctor came by and told the nurse she should have called him if she felt resistance, though she said she hadn’t felt any.

I had a CT scan that afternoon and the following morning had a laminectomy (spinal surgery) and the rest of the epidural catheter was removed.

The incision is mostly healed and I am able to move about pretty well. However, I am wanting to know what the potential effect of having this spinal surgery is for my body in the future. Are there chances of increased back pain at the area as I age? Is it more susceptible to injury in the future?

For a few years now, perhaps 3 years, I have had extremely painful pelvic or period cramps before, during and after my period. I haven’t given birth but it feels akin to what I imagine that feels like. My pelvic region feels like it is breaking apart. I also have buttock pain (close to my anus and middle of left buttcheek) and ovary pain. I can really feel my ovaries. They feel tender. The entire left side of my pelvis wraps around in pain. I also get strong rectal spasms and radiating (butt downward) leg pain. 

The pain is so strong I literally bend over my bed and groan, unable to move. My entire body is tense as it washes over me. Boiling hot showers used to help but no longer does. I have cried while holding onto a desk, unable to move. It varies but I can be in pain up to 3 weeks out of the month. I would say it is fairly consistently an 8 on a scale of 1-10, assuming natural childbirth is a 10. Don’t know, haven’t experienced. 

I have been to a gynecologist 2 years ago. She ran all the blood tests, ultrasound, even an endometrial biopsy (which should not be allowed to be performed without going under it was that painful). NOTHING. No cysts or fibroids. No hormonal issues. Endometrial biopsy showed nothing. There was a passing mention of a tilted uterus. Nothing to worry about. Obviously the only thing they couldn’t really test was endometriosis. She gave me a wack ass prescription pain medication for period cramps. It did not work. I take 4 Advil’s which take about an hour to kick in and stops working 4 hours in. I take another 4. This continues for weeks.  I have a heavy period for 2 days, large clots, then it tapers off quickly. Period ends at 4-6 days usually, the pain continues. It is so bad I have often considered going to the ER multiple times, except I know they will just give me pain meds and a bill. 

I went to a gastroenterologist. I did not get a colonoscopy but they took a stool sample and said it was fine. I have self diagnosed myself with ibs. I alternate between C and D it appears. 

My left hip clicks/grinds. So does my right knee and my left ankle. My buttcrack is tilted to the right a bit. Short leg on the right I assume. Possibly fallen arches as my feet are flat. I only carry my bag on my leg shoulder. Right calf is an inch larger than left. Can’t tell if this means it is stronger or weaker. Pelvic tilt? Gait issues affecting my pelvis?

I’ve googled for years and cannot understand what is wrong with me. Mittleshmerz? kidney problems? Piroformis? Sciatica? All the ibds? Anterior pelvic tilt? Have I developed fibroids or a cyst out of nowhere?  It may be endo. No one seems to believe that is real. What do I do next? 

I suspect passing the overly large clots (way larger than a quarter at times), or possible severe constipation has something to do with the pain during my period. It does not explain why I get cramps before and after. I am highly stressed but I work out a few days a week, varying intensity.  Is there a blood thinning type of medication that would prevent the heavy clots or make them easier to pass?

I could really use some help even if it’s just a direction to go in. I welcome all ideas. Since I have no health insurance, I cannot visit multiple specialists.

"Info- 21 Female 5’6 170lbs white, question about pregnancies, never been pregnant and am not currently pregnant. 

Hi all, I have a question because I’m in quarantine and have been watching a lot of pregnancy videos for god knows what reason. 

I was just thinking about my family history of difficult childbirth. My grandmother had two stillborn children, and my mom almost died having my sister and I. I think it has to do with no dilation and small hips (the latter of which I thankfully did not inherit) but I am wondering about when I do get pregnant if I can have an elective C section. I know they are not very popular, but I do not know why. I have a lot of anxiety around childbirth, even though I love kids and definitely want at least a couple in the future. The idea of a vaginal childbirth sounds horrific to me, with all the tearing and stretching and whatnot, in addition to my family history of things not going smoothly. 

Are c sections easier? What are the side effects? Why are elective c sections not more common?

My friend has had symptoms of a non viable pregnancy for a week, ever since her levels went down. She was given a biopsy Tuesday and it confirmed the baby wasnt in the uterus. The ob told her to wait it out for a little longer. Yesterday night she started having horrible pain. She went to the er and they told her ""miscarriages happen"" and gave her pheytonol after she told them she didnt want it. This morning she went back and was told ""well I dont know what to tell you, miscarriages hurt and you cant just go around getting narcotics for it. "" she left crying and called me crying that they think shes drug seeking. She went back to her job and he said she is having a ectopic pregnancy and its serious and there are too many traumas tonight so she needs to go home and wait until they call her tomorrow. When they call her she must go in asap.

My thing is isnt this an emergency? I told her to go to the other hospital (it's a county hospital that handles trauma surgeries mostly). That hospital tends to be better when I go there also. 

Should she wait or is it really serious and she needs to go get treated at the other er.",14.0,7.597032522233006,14.0,0.114,0.847,0.039,-0.9519,1316,1,2.9223276083055625,1.596

"Toddler seizures? Or something else?

(Copied from r/epilepsy as I didn’t know this was a sub that existed at the time)

Hello, I hope this is ok to post, I’m just looking for a bit of advice. 

My son is 18 months old [1M] and I have noticed he has been doing some things that I’ve found slightly concerning. Namely, he will randomly roll his eyes upwards and (sometimes, not every time) shake his head or similar movements. It only lasts a second or a few at most. He also “spaces out” sometimes but I never really paid much attention to it until recently so I’m not sure if it’s just normal toddler behaviour or if it’s something else/excessive. Likewise, I’m not sure if there’s any other ‘warnings’ that he does as I’m a first time mum and always just taken everything as ‘normal’ as I haven’t had any reason until now to suspect otherwise. 

My partner thinks I’m over reacting, and says that it’s just him being “nutty” - admittedly he is a ball of energy so I wouldn’t be completely surprised if it was just a quirk, but something in me is telling me it’s not just that. He was also born 2 months premature at 32 weeks, had a 3 week NICU stay but touch wood, no lasting effects (he’s been walking for months, babbles and says a few words, is very aware and I have no reason to be concerned about any of his development) so I m not sure if that makes a difference, like the possibility of it being more common in premature children? 

Anyone who can give a bit of insight would be thoroughly appreciated. Please feel free to tell me if I’m being just a paranoid mother, and in the same breath please don’t refrain from being blunt if you think it’s a cause for concern.

"A little back story... I’ve been on Citalopram +/- Xanax since shortly after my daughter’s birth 5 years ago.  I’d dealt with anxiety for years prior to that and finally had the courage to ask for help after going through child birth. 

Well... pregnancy and those meds are not recommend by my OB so I’ve been off them since I found out at 5 weeks and am now 13 +4. I asked my doctor about alternatives at my first appointment and she seemed a little avoidant of them so I said I’d try and tough it out.

It just feels worse and worse the more pregnant I get.  I feel like my partner is trying so hard to be patient with me but my anxiety just has these moments where it’s through the roof. I have this irrational fear he is going to get sick of dealing with me. I keep worrying about every little thing and most importantly my fuse is SO short I blow up over minor things. After I snap I feel terrible and end up crying or feeling depressed. I know some is normal pregnancy stuff but it’s so frustrating feeling like I felt pre-medication. 

I’m debating on asking for medication that is safe during pregnancy but then I get insecure that I’m being a titty baby. Any experience with this or advise on how to cope?

I went to an urgent care and they attributed it to stress and gave me ondansetron sublinqual prn. 
A few weeks ago I started having episodes of severe burning pain in my chest, sweating, light headed and severe nausea. Sometimes, instead of the burning, I will have cramping pain in my abdomen. So far the only thing that helps is lying down for 20-30 minutes. There does not seem to be a trigger and it does not happen exclusively after eating. In fact it's usually completely random.
I work in a hospital as a student nurse and I've been having these episodes. I can't exactly go lie down so I have to power through it. Usually I can go sit and chart which helps. My nausea is getting worse and worse to the point I need to find a bathroom bc I am sure I will throw up (I usually don't, only once or twice). These symptoms are really starting to affect my life. 
I want to know if anyone had ideas. If I can avoid going to a specialist I really need to, at least until I graduate in May.

"For a long while now I have felt like my breathing has been labored, but my parents work long hours and I have anxiety which I think may either cause this or make me blow it out of proportion. Just now I've gotten really curious and searched for causes and symptoms of shortness of breath and found a page ***(Link at bottom)*** which describes most of my tendencies pretty well. I saw a few pages and quickly made links between my symptoms and theirs and I have a pretty shot memory so I don't know if I have started to struggle more over time. As I made the links I flared up my anxiety and here I am writing this.

I am 14 years old male, around 5'8'' and 60kg. I experience this everywhere but mostly at home. I take Ritalin LA and regular Ritalin pretty much daily for my ADHD and Melatonin occasionally to help me sleep.

Before you ask, no I'm not a smoker, I haven't had illnesses diagnosed in the past that are related and I am not aware of myself being an asthmatic. The only other problem I have currently is an unconfirmed intolerance to lactose which gives me these foul tasting burps and occasionally nausea. Also, this part might just be the teenager in me, but I have zero motivation to go to sleep and spend most of my nights up until early morning.

The symptoms the site read that I present are:

* High heart rate with chest heaviness
* Chest pain, pressure or palpitations
* Paleness
* Dizziness or sinking sensation
* Fatigue
* Fainting (rarely)symptoms from: [https://www.unitypoint.org/livewell/article.aspx?id=cd526f2e-26d4-4b6c-845a-c215a9ce8aee](https://www.unitypoint.org/livewell/article.aspx?id=cd526f2e-26d4-4b6c-845a-c215a9ce8aee)
* Sudden and random shortness of breath
* Constant Swallowing
* Breathing manually when it occurs
* Worsening when lying down
* Strange floating/sinking feelings/sensations

I have also experienced strange feelings I cannot describe when under stress, seeing specific things or hearing sounds.

I hope this is in depth enough for somebody to know what I'm experiencing so I can find some closure and clarity in this situation. Thank you for your possible help in the future.

"Hello all. I have been suffering from this for years. I genuinely just want opinions rather than a diagnosis. I'd like to be prepared for my visits with the doctor and specialists.

My symptoms started when I was 20. I first had knee pain then shoulder pain and pain in my upper back and neck. I put this down to working out and old pains from sports. I first noticed the pain when I was working out. I left it alone and saw a chiropractor and Physio during this time. I was tol/generally told that I had muscle imbalances, muscle activation issues and compensation issues. It seemed to make sense at the time.

Fast forward 3 years. I begin to develop pain in my hips and elbows. Now my problem joints start to make noises and grind. I begin to worry and my doctor sends me for an mri of my most painful joints. Both of my shoulders have signs of early osteoarthritis, cysts and snall osteophytes.

I put this down to overuse and continue with regular activities... Fast forward about 2 years later and my pain gets worse. I now feel pain in my hands and fingers and thumbs. Now all of these joints are painful, crack, grind and cause me trouble. I have definitely noticed a significant loss of strength. For example, I can't even hold up a piece of paper without my shoulders burning.

Most of my pain is with movement. The more I do the more it'll hurt. The thing is, even at rest I sometimes notice random jolts of pain and aches to different joints. I don't have much swelling and stiffness is usually fine. I definitely do have osteoarthritis in some of these joints... The thing is why?

I have not done any sort of intense labor. I haven't fallen or been in a major accident but so many of my joints hurt. The key here is that my symptoms are bilateral and they were discovered as such. For example when my thumb pain started, It was in both thumbs. It wasn't one side of the body. I'm at a complete loss as to how I have so much joint pain and damage at such a young age without any traumatic history.

I have done a bloodtest for rheumatoid arthritis. It was clear according to my doctor. My RF says ""<10"" and my CRP says 4.6. In my opinion it has to be something attacking me because so much wear and tear all over the place at such a young age is NOT normal",37.0,8.171327436057224,37.0,0.144,0.808,0.047,-0.9921,2281,1,3.0631780472239947,5.327999999999999

8 infections since June 2019, presenting as Pain in lower left abdomen & pelvis. Is an aching pain and hurts on my perineum when I wipe after using the bathroom. Hurts to put pressure on abdomen. 

I would love any help i can get to figure out what is going on with my chronic lower abdominal pain.

October 2018, At 41 weeks pregnant i was induced, resulting in a csection after 20 hours of labor. It was a traumatic birth, the epidural wore off and I could feel an intense burning when they started the procedure, started to scream and they knocked me out. Baby was 9pds 13oz and healthy. I never had any health issue until after the birth. I have had 7 infections since then without explanation. Here is a breakdown of the past year: 

I recovered from the csection and all seemed relatively fine until June. I had an intense pain in my lower left abdomen, right above my pelvic bone. It feels swollen to the touch. Pelvic exam looks good. Doctor said it was a UTI although I had no other classic symptoms. In house test came back clear, but culture at the lab came back as ‘Greater than 100,000 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus saprophyticus’. I’m given antibiotics.

A month later I have the same pain, again in house comes back clear but lab says ‘ 10,000-50,000 CFU/mL of Escherichia coli’ and I’m diagnosed with another UTI and sent home with antibiotics. 

A month later i have same pain, and doc calls me in antibiotic over the phone with refills to take after intercourse. 

Primary refers me to obgyn, who sends me to pelvic floor therapy (Tens unit kind). 
No improvement and another infection. Just given antibiotics and no culture sent to lab.

Obgyn sends me to obgyn urologist. He does a cystoscopy, which looks good. Sonogram looks good. Sends me to pelvic floor PT with a certified pelvic floor therapist. No improvement and still another infection. I went to my primary to get a culture but the Doc forgot to send it to the lab for testing.

I get pregnant but miscarry at 6 weeks. 

I go to see a new obgyn in hopes new insight can help. Sonogram comes back clear. Pelvic exam is good. He has a Laparoscopic planned for later in the month. He thinks this could not be a UTI at all, but not sure what it could be. 
I have another currently but am waiting for lab results.",9.0,8.461379118793378,9.0,0.098,0.815,0.087,-0.3034,2402,0,1.1263073209975867,0.882

"Hello. I'm looking for some suggestions regarding a long term issue with a male turning 3 years old VERY soon. In the interests of keeping things summised & concise I'll bullet point some facts / routes taken / symptoms etc, so there is overlap but I want to provide the full picture as concisely as possible. Please ask me to elaborate if you would like more in-depth details. I would be very grateful of any diligent readers to share there opinion / suggestion on where to go next.

To today the child has consistent issues with laying flat - and wakes on average 2 to 4 times a night unless upright. Though wakes much more frequently when fighting an infection (for up to 7 weeks often).

Ideally I'm looking for suggestions on investigations or theories. I'd like to state plainly that I'm just looking for avenues of consideration here. Or even additional suggestions on where else to try posting this - or individuals to contact who may have an interest in this case.

ENT have essentially reached there options here, with only an adenoidectomy left to offer (though this was supposed to have been done last year, read on for full details). Could another discipline offer more investigations?

* 6 months: tongue tie identified and separated. Very quick recovery but no real change to aforementioned unsettling.
* 6+ months: GP suggests cows milk intolerance, mother goes vegan, baby predominantly breast feeding but is supplemented with very occasional prescription specialist formula without dairy.
* 9+ months: child begins to develop a clockwork routine of severe congestion. Each bout lasts for 7 weeks, with scarcely a week of lessened symptoms between. These run back to back, like a well run train, including to today (child is nearly 3 years old).
* 18 months: engaged with general paediatrics & ENT. Behavioural ruled out & sleep study undergone. Deemed not to be full sleep apnoea, but there is evidence of obstruction. Adenoidectomy planned, but instead tonsillectomy is carried out.
24+ months: brief respite from back to back congestion / infections, but have returned by now until almost 36 months.
* Child has been on antibiotics 5 times in the last 18 months.

I'll end this here, though I reiterate: please do ask for greater details on any of these points. I'm happy to provide as much information as possible. This has effected the child so deeply for so long and I fear the current department either haven't grasped the extent of this, or the focus has been too great on one area, and perhaps somebody here reading this will have a fresher perspective or an idea of another department to seek referral to.

"I have a friend (who I'll call Sally) with whom my relationship is quite complex at the moment, but it's all on my end. The issue is that she considers us to be much closer than I feel to her, and I know that what contributed to this is that I tend to be a people pleaser. I've gotten much better about this in recent years, but because I still struggled in this area when I first met her, our relationship was set on a precedent where I pretty much said yes to a lot of her initiatives to hang out with some degree of regularity. This, of course, in addition to me engaging in frequent conversation with her via text message contributed to her perception that we are very close friends. What made it harder for me to say no to her is that she is high maintenance in that she is very sensitive. 

Anyway, over the past year or two, I've gradually realized that she and I are more different than are similar, so I never feel like I can be my true self when around her. It's become clear to me that it's not fair to her to be in this more one-sided friendship. In the past 2 weeks, I've been trying to figure out how to best handle this situation, and then lo and behold, I find out that I'm pregnant exactly one week ago.   
I have another friend who got her BFP two weeks before me. This friend and Sally do not know each other at all, so I casually mentioned to Sally that a friend of mine just got her BFP.  Sally's response was, ""I'm glad she told you. It's so important even in those early days.""   
Based on this, I know she'd be hurt/offended if I waited until 12 weeks+, but then again, if I tell her at the 5 or 6 weeks mark or so, will this just be another thing to cement into her mind that she and I are as close as she perceives?   
I may be stressing about this unnecessarily, but I'd love some advice on how to handle this situation.",14.0,6.954264777142966,14.0,0.034,0.799,0.168,0.9961,1852,1,0.20236890661270163,0.47600000000000003
"Hi all,
Posting for my wife.
Our due date is supposedly in 2 days.
However her cervix hasn't opened and the baby hasn't dropped.

Last night she has started cramping frequently and painfully, and it hasnt stopped all day. 
We went to the ob this afternoon and he checked and her cervix is still closed and the baby hasn't dropped. 
So he said these aren't real contractions.  I guess they are Braxton hicks. 

Tonight They seem to be coming faster. 
I'm starting to write them down.  They might not be 5 1 1 but I bet it is close.  But It's hard to believe things shifted that much in 8 hours. 

If these are just frequent Braxton hicks, does anyone have any recommendations/advice? It's tough to just sit here and watch. 

Any advice is much appreciated.


EDIT:  We hit 5 1 1 and went to the hospital.  The baby hadn't dropped,nor had her water broken.  We tried to walk for several hours and no change - we went and got checked every few hours.  During one of the checks they noticed that the baby's heart beat started dropping a bit during some contractions   We did a c-section and the umbilical cord was wrapped around the baby's neck, which was holding the baby up.

It’s a long story so I’ll keep it simple. My girlfriend and I were having sex until the condom broke on us and we immediately started considering what to do.  We decided on getting a plan b from the cvs down the street. Once we got it however we thought we might as well try sex without a condom if were going to use the plan b anyways. Long story short I finish (not inside her), we clean up and she takes the plan b within 5 minutes. The next day she got her period and is lying down naked on the bathroom floor with excruciating stomach pains with her mom right next to her. She said it was the worst pain she’s experienced in a long time. Along with the abdominal she has no appetite and is very sore among her abs from working out, which is why I believe the pains could have been so painful. Last night she was at work going to the bathroom and found a piece of the condom in her vagina. She immediately called me and I tried to calm her down and say we did everything we were supposed to do and she will be ok. Right now she is still very nervous and uneasy about the whole situation. I’m trying my best to calm her down and assure her nothing bad will happen as there was no actual cum involved in the raw sex only precum (not to mention I barely went in as I was unsure about doing it), she got her period the next day and is still on it, and we took a plan b as soon as we could after having unprotected sex. So, do you guys think there’s anything to worry about or should we set it aside and not stress over it ?",21.0,7.77225120271329,21.0,0.128,0.815,0.057,-0.9774,1623,1,2.245220136818102,2.688
"Hi all, 

24F, 5'5"" approx. 200lbs. Former smoker, quit over a year ago. No history of chronic physical illness aside from heart palpitations/tachycardia episodes. Take 50 mg Labetalol daily for this. 34 weeks + 4 days pregnant, due May 25. Normal, healthy pregnancy but baby previously measured large. 

The issue is that, for the last 4 weeks, I have felt like there is someone sitting on/squeezing my chest. It starts each day anywhere between 1 and 3 hours after I wake up and continues indefinitely throughout the day. I've been home due to covid-19 and my pregnancy, I'd previously worked directly with the community. It's the most I've been home since we moved into our apartment a couple months back. 

Some details: 

• I live in Wyoming. 

• I've become allergic to my guinea pig because pregnancy is weird. Our place has a lot of dust too so we thought maybe allergies. Tried Claritin and Benadryl. I take both daily. Mixed results.

• My former OB had recommended I try an inhaler so I did. It does not offer relief. He brushed me off otherwise. 

• Sitting up or lying on my back makes it worse. Laying on my side on the floor helps somewhat. Lying in front of a fan usually helps.

• I have been tested (negative) for flu and RSV at Urgent Care. This was the last time anyone listened to my lungs/heart. 

• I have a long history of anxiety and panic disorder. New OB suggests I take Benadryl for anxiety. It makes me tired but does not help otherwise. New OB does not want anything to do with helping the mental health issues; suggested seeing a psychiatrist. 

• Seeing a psych Monday.

Does anyone have any ideas? Anything? I'm losing my mind here with this and it seems like every medical professional I've seen shrugs me off after giving me a half-assed response. Thanks guys.

Date of last menstrual cycle: 11/1/2019 - 6 days

Previous menstrual cycle: 12/13/2018 - 4 days

Quick mention because I've been asked before: I have not had menstrual cramps since my early teen's and my cycle started at 9 years old.

In March of 2019 I was checked for PCOS and they didn't find anything. I had a very healthy pap smear, and ultrasound check up which showed among everything else a healthy follicle produced. 
My husband and I have been trying for another baby for 3 years. No fertility specialists seen or fertility meds taken. 
Prior to May 2019 I was taking 6mg of Risperidone daily and lactating heavily. I still take 80mg of fluoxetine daily. No issues with sex drive or having sex. No vaginal discharge, smells, itching, etc. No issues with dryness or discomfort.

Other than the missed cycles, I've been doing fine physically. Mental health, not so much. I see my psychologist twice a month and my psychiatrist every 10 to 12 weeks. However, in July, I began having intense sobbing sessions 2 to 3 times a week. Crying for so long and hard I had impaired vision for a bit afterwards. No angry or irritable outbursts, no impulsive or manic episodes, just sobbing. My depression dipped once in early September and I stood for an estimated 15 minutes with a loaded sig sauer 226 pressed to my temple but, talked myself down. I have not talked to my mental health professionals about these issues as I already don't enjoy my visits and I know these would make them worse. I am very aware that this is the wrong thing to do and they need to be informed. 

Also, I am normally very tidy and clean. I really enjoy cleaning and organizing but lately, I can barely bring myself to sweep my floors. In general, I find no joy at all in anything. I also ballooned from 250 in August of 2018 to 360 in August of 2019 and have stayed between 359 and 362 since. I do have a scale that weighs up to 400 lbs and I do weigh myself twice a week on Monday and Friday. 

My pregnancy was uneventful. I had difficulty getting pregnant but took no fertility meds, etc. Very healthy baby born, completely natural and I actually impressed (at least I think they were) the medical staff when I was up and walking and using the bathroom without assistance roughly an hour after giving birth. So, if that means anything? IDK.

For the past three years at least, I’ve been having a very hard time dealing with emotions. My main issue is when I get emotionally worked up. It really started when I was scared about my drivers ed class in school. I know it sounds like regular jitters, but I was in physical pain before I had that class every day. I would begin to get anxious and then it would feel like someone was running burning ice over my bones.

"A virus has been making its way around my work and home that I assume is some (super-) strain of flu.


My own symptoms began as watery eyes, runny nose, fatigue. Then came waking up with a truly, all consuming, awful headache which I could not properly think and function with until taking a double dose of ibuprofen, along with a scratchy throat and cough that hade me needing a breathing treatment (diagnosed asthmatic at 5 yo; use albuterol; it happened the last 3 days as soon as I woke up- those days, no more tightness or wheezing for the rest of the day).


Today started off the same, but went on to get worse every hour. At this point, I feel like I have been hit by a train, my headache won't go away with meds, exhausted, swollen and painful throat and lymphnodes, fever of 103.6, eyes watery and burning, sinus congestion, chest pain, my head feels like a balloon detached from my body with tingling and random instances of spinning (like when you're extremely drunk), blackness creeps into my vision, my ears suddenly feel as if they're underwater, cough, sweating and chills, difficulty thinking and somewhat impaired motor skills, horrible nausea, vomiting every sip of liquid I try to take in.


From what I remember, and just my own personal ""knowledge"", most of that is typical flu and likely some dehydration. - BUT- I have this tingling and numbness in my arms, hands, legs, and feet. The sensation comes and goes like waves crashing, though since a couple of hours ago, coldness/tingling/numbness is constant in my fingers and part of the underside of my forearm. It is definitely in both hands, but stronger on the right side.


I have asthma, like I said; severe seasonal (something diff in every season); every few months I end up spending a couple of weeks in the hospital having to be given breathing treatments every 1-2 hours (sometimes more), antibiotics, and steroids--it happens 2-3 times a year, always starts off as a cold and quickly becomes bronchitis or pneumonia, treatment is the same every single time; o2 usually hovers around low 50s to mid 60s for a few days (that's *with* treatment).... And I have allergic reactions to penicillin, amoxicillin (sp?), and levoquin (sp?) 


I also have schizoaffective bipolar disorder; OCD; anxiety w/panic attacks; adhd


I have advanced lumbar stenosis and 2 ruptured disc's (also lumbar) ; I had 3 facial reconstructive surgeries (the last one was sometime before 2005); and I have had 3 natural births (second was a complicated pregnancy and complicated birth; third was one month premature); no recent physical trauma/injury


Used heavy drugs (all of them-wasn't picky) from a young age, picked up drinking hardcore in 2012; was physically dependant on opiates, benzos, and alcohol until 2016-ish (went through many cold-turkey withdrawals that were accompanied by seizures and other really great stuff)


Currently, daily, take: zyrtec, geodon, zoloft, suboxone, klonopin, and adderall, *have taken one breathing treatment /day for 3 days in early morning (tbh I just take the treatment until the asthmatic symptoms are gone, then save the rest of the solution for next time. I am running low and it is expensive) - - - have taken ibuprofen once a day for 3 days (mornings)


That is everything that I can think of that anyone might want to know about my health... It has taken most of the evening to be able to complete this post because I just feel like I'm dying...


If you need anymore information, just ask. Idc what people think about me anymore regarding my medical and substance abuse history. It is what it is.



Just for clarification : my biggest worries are the extremity numbness/coldness/tingling, and also just the severity of all of my symptoms. I have extensive experience being sick, and have had the flu before, but this is just really intense and frightening. No one who I know who has been sick with similar symptoms recently has  been affected this severely.... (if you are going to basically tell me I am a crybaby or just not able to handle the same severity of symptoms as most other people, just save it. I am a pro at powering through and this is not typical + I have a few things going on, like the spinning head and blackness in my vision and the numb/cold/tingle extrems, that no one else I know has had).

"Hello doctors and fellow sick folks. You can call me Strider, Strides, SickBish, whatever. 
Im a 23 yr old female, and a year ago I was pretty healthy. At least I felt I was. Never got that sick, flus and infections lasted very little time, always bounced back quickly. Aside from a few issues here n there (Insane allergies, a bought of ammonia poisoning from cleaning a guys house that broughton a HORRIBLE migraine) I have been HEALTHY. 
now? Oh boy. 

I'd say it started in July 2019. I first started noticing weightloss. Granted at first I assumed it was because its summer and I am more active. However this weightloss continued, its now November, and I have dropped from 130lbs to barely 102lbs. Well over the normal rate and with no signs of stopping. This includes symptoms such as: Hair loss, Heart palpitations, night sweats where i wake up freezing, headaches (behind the left eye) that are sharp and very painful, im now coughing up brown spotted phlegm (i just quit smoking because of this too. WebMD is terrifying and I regret looking)

 EDIT: i am coughing up more brown spotted, thick phlegm, sometimes its just straight up brown and very dark. Its definitely phlegm/sputum, not mucus from my sinus, and I have been told its old blood trapped in my lungs. Is this true??? 

 my appetite is ruined. Im fatigued, nauseous, puking randomly, pale as all heck, and when I do eat, I get sweaty and sick. Because of the weightloss I have been forcing myself to eat, but it makes me ill and upset everytime. I am 5'1"" at MOST and usually weigh 120-130lbs. I can see my ribs. My collarbone. My hipbones. My pants dont fit and I have NEVER been this small except when i was 19 and diagnosed with Severe Depressive disorder. This is being managed VERY WELL and I gained my weight back in two months after starting proper medication. 

My old GP just kept sending me for pregnancy tests (3 of them and then insisted on an STI check. Ive been celibate for 2 years and Im a lesbian) and then sent me to an entirely different doctor. I live in northern BC and the NHS is lacking in my area, and the new GP was going to make me wait a month for results on the 20th of november. I said screw that and drove 2hrs to a NEW NEW gp. He ran a bunch of brand new tests and it came back clear within this week. xrays, ekg, bloodwork for my glucose and thyroid all came back normal. Im waiting on a scope now but my nagging fear is that we missed something. Is it in my mouth? my lungs? my throat? Now the gp is now bringing up colon cancer, so i have a stool sample to do as well. However if the scope and the sample come back clear, this new new GP wants to chalk it up to stress. ""Just stress.""

I really don't believe this is just stress. I have had medical issues in the past that were chalked up to ""oh you have an anxiety disorder, its That."" (Ie my migraines from cleaning a hoarders house. surprise; i was actually sick.) I dont seem to have a deficiency. Im really scared its going to turn out to be something worse, however Im even more scared these tests are going to be nonconclusive and yet again, im going to be told to change my meds or ""you just need to learn to relax."" I have already talked to my paych and my CM, I have been managing my mental health better than ever. Sure I am stressed now, but of course I am, my health is failing and my hair is falling out. Im wasting away and no one knows why. I am going to be devastated if yet again I'm told ""oh well you're just stressed and didnt realize.""

Should I find a specialist? Get more tests? Im at a loss and I'm waiting on this scope and stool sample but I don't want to give up here when I'm certain something is wrong with my BODY, not my mental health. and im certain its my BODY. I really am.

Today I [M, 21, 5'5, 200 lbs] went in for a colonoscopy today to see if there was anything wrong with my colon. The doctor said everything looked normal and they're going to do some biopsys.

However before the procedure started the nurse noticed that the rhythm of my heart was off. He mentioned to the doctor before she started and told me that I'm having PVC but it does not affect the procedure. They proceeded with the colonoscopy. 

The doctor told me to get an EKG with my primary doctor, however, I'm pretty busy the rest of the week and already missed a couple days of school due to the scheduled colonoscopy. I was concerned about the PVC and how cautious and concerned I should be. Any advice is appreciated.

"Good evening! I want to ask after a friend of mine who has been suffering from chronic gastric pain for nigh on 5 years now. He's been to four gastroenterologists so far and had his gallbladder taken out with no success and no results, but I recently convinced him to go take a test for porphyrias and got an interesting result back! Regarding relevant patient info, I can tell you that he is 23-24 years old, male, white, obese/overweight (281 lbs, down from 350 when he was first diagnosed), height over 6"" and lives down South. He's taken **Elavil** (amitriptyline) but stopped after he didn't feel any different months into the treatment. He also smokes weed regularly in order to cope with the pain symptoms, but he's also quit and gone cold turkey for a month before in order to see if it was related to the weed. According to him, there were no major changes.   


So first of all, he says his problem has been going on since he was 18. He has suffered from **chronic, diffuse stomach pain** around his core area, centering on the right-hand region his gallbladder had been. It doesn't seem to move beyond his stomach. He describes it as burning and ranging from 3-8 on a scale of 1-10 in terms of pain. In combination with this pain, he has **fatigue**, **bloating**, **chronic diarrhea**, which is either bright yellow and loose or dark, smelly and condensed, nausea (also on a level of 3-8) and connected with a hospital visit he had to go to in 2018, a ""**weirdly high heart rate**"". I personally also believe that whatever he has is tied to his **depression**, either causing it indirectly or directly influencing his mental health. Some days he seems pretty alright, but other days it's very very bad, which is why I'm asking your help.  


He has told me that he has some triggers, but avoiding them isn't enough to stop the pain. He has told me that the nausea is present the strongest in the morning and after eating or on an empty stomach. He vomits until there is bile, and there is occasionally blood in that vomit. He has also mentioned heat, pressure, stress and drinking too much water being triggers for greater chronic pain; and from past accounts of his, I'm inclined to believe that sickness is a trigger as well. The hospital/ER visit he went to in 2018 was tied to salmonella, and a cold that a friend gave him severely triggered whatever it was that he was suffering from.

On his journey, he's attempted several treatments--an anti-nausea pregnancy wristband which worked until it didn't. A TENS unit which did not work. Gallbladder removal, Elavil, and a low FODMap diet. According to him, the FODMap diet has helped him somewhat with his diarrhea, which is why he's still on it. 

The concerning thing is that he has not been able to find anything out about whatever he's suffering from for a long time. All tests come back normal. He's had an abdominal MRI, multiple stool and blood tests, gastroscopy and colonoscopy, as well as an intestinal biopsy. The doctors apparently have not found anything aside from the fact that he has no inflammation and does not guard his stomach when touched. They have apparently definitely ruled out IBS and Crohn's.  


His current diagnosis is one of exclusion; his doctor believes he has Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome as no other tests have returned anything thus far. I don't think that's the right diagnosis, and I recently got him to take a 24-hour urine test specifically for porphyrias. According to that test, he has high COPROPOR I and COPROPOR III levels, although not enough to be multifold. **CPI is around 30ug where the reference interval is 0-24ug, and CPIII is around 88ug where the reference interval is 0-74ug.** I think it might be related to his liver but I'm not sure if there's anything specific.   


He just wants to know what it really is; and I do too. He'll be visiting his fifth gastroenterologist on Monday and I'm really anxious about making it a productive visit. Please help us!",40.0,9.647175140431994,40.0,0.134,0.792,0.074,-0.9941,3991,0,1.8105661397108501,5.36
"A virus has been making its way around my work and home that I assume is some (super-) strain of flu.


My own symptoms began as watery eyes, runny nose, fatigue. Then came waking up with a truly, all consuming, awful headache which I could not properly think and function with until taking a double dose of ibuprofen, along with a scratchy throat and cough that hade me needing a breathing treatment (diagnosed asthmatic at 5 yo; use albuterol; it happened the last 3 days as soon as I woke up- those days, no more tightness or wheezing for the rest of the day).


Today started off the same, but went on to get worse every hour. At this point, I feel like I have been hit by a train, my headache won't go away with meds, exhausted, swollen and painful throat and lymphnodes, fever of 103.6, eyes watery and burning, sinus congestion, chest pain, my head feels like a balloon detached from my body with tingling and random instances of spinning (like when you're extremely drunk), blackness creeps into my vision, my ears suddenly feel as if they're underwater, cough, sweating and chills, difficulty thinking and somewhat impaired motor skills, horrible nausea, vomiting every sip of liquid I try to take in.


From what I remember, and just my own personal ""knowledge"", most of that is typical flu and likely some dehydration. - BUT- I have this tingling and numbness in my arms, hands, legs, and feet. The sensation comes and goes like waves crashing, though since a couple of hours ago, coldness/tingling/numbness is constant in my fingers and part of the underside of my forearm. It is definitely in both hands, but stronger on the right side.


I have asthma, like I said; severe seasonal (something diff in every season); every few months I end up spending a couple of weeks in the hospital having to be given breathing treatments every 1-2 hours (sometimes more), antibiotics, and steroids--it happens 2-3 times a year, always starts off as a cold and quickly becomes bronchitis or pneumonia, treatment is the same every single time; o2 usually hovers around low 50s to mid 60s for a few days (that's *with* treatment).... And I have allergic reactions to penicillin, amoxicillin (sp?), and levoquin (sp?) 


I also have schizoaffective bipolar disorder; OCD; anxiety w/panic attacks; adhd


I have advanced lumbar stenosis and 2 ruptured disc's (also lumbar) ; I had 3 facial reconstructive surgeries (the last one was sometime before 2005); and I have had 3 natural births (second was a complicated pregnancy and complicated birth; third was one month premature); no recent physical trauma/injury


Used heavy drugs (all of them-wasn't picky) from a young age, picked up drinking hardcore in 2012; was physically dependant on opiates, benzos, and alcohol until 2016-ish (went through many cold-turkey withdrawals that were accompanied by seizures and other really great stuff)


Currently, daily, take: zyrtec, geodon, zoloft, suboxone, klonopin, and adderall, *have taken one breathing treatment /day for 3 days in early morning (tbh I just take the treatment until the asthmatic symptoms are gone, then save the rest of the solution for next time. I am running low and it is expensive) - - - have taken ibuprofen once a day for 3 days (mornings)


That is everything that I can think of that anyone might want to know about my health... It has taken most of the evening to be able to complete this post because I just feel like I'm dying...


If you need anymore information, just ask. Idc what people think about me anymore regarding my medical and substance abuse history. It is what it is.



Just for clarification : my biggest worries are the extremity numbness/coldness/tingling, and also just the severity of all of my symptoms. I have extensive experience being sick, and have had the flu before, but this is just really intense and frightening. No one who I know who has been sick with similar symptoms recently has  been affected this severely.... (if you are going to basically tell me I am a crybaby or just not able to handle the same severity of symptoms as most other people, just save it. I am a pro at powering through and this is not typical + I have a few things going on, like the spinning head and blackness in my vision and the numb/cold/tingle extrems, that no one else I know has had).

"28yo female 5’2 220lbs(working on it have lost 15 already)

Today I had a stress test due to these strong palpitations after exertion, every other beat or sometimes 5 in a row, continually for at least an hour, which have been going on almost 3 years now, with no pattern disturbance, happens like clockwork after any exertion, couple times a week. Of course they didn’t happen until I got in my car to go home. Decided to just drive next door to the ER, the doctor there didn’t even look at the monitor and just said to call my cardio. Cardio suggests beta blockers but I’d rather continue searching for the cause of this until I’ve exhausted all possibilities.

I guess my questions are these:

1. Could a hiatial hernia or stomach dislocation cause heart palpitations only from exertion? I ask this because it gets better if lay down, and comes right back if I sit up. It also gets worse if I drink or eat anything after activity. Sometimes also if I bend down not during activity I get some strong palps. I also have a history of bulimia and these attacks started after pregnancy which I gained a lot of weight, a lot.
2. I was anemic after birth, and they did start directly after birth. My iron and rbc levels were normal not long after. I never had my ferritin tested until a few weeks ago and it was 40. My saturation in April was 45% everything else normal. What chance do you think the low ferritin level is causing this?",1.0,7.2282824555425265,1.0,0.065,0.847,0.088,0.8317,1438,2,0.738552437223043,0.065
"Okay, I'll try not to make this super long while trying to include relevant information. I've been dealing with a handful of symptoms, off and on, for a couple of years now. I am 31F, white, 5'8 140 lbs, mom x 4. No meds, couple drinks every other weekend, no smoking/drugs. Decent exercise.



January of 2018, I went to my family doctor for first time in 6 years. Mostly for joint pain and stiffness in my hands, knees, feet - ongoing 2.5 months. Hands were worst-felt like a rubberband holding fingers tight. Also complained of always being tired and bad headaches daily. Dr. said to exercise more and I was tired because I had 4 young kids. Ran blood work and calls me and says ""Your blood work is in, it looks like you have lupus. I'm sending you to a rheumatologist."" Positive ANA and positive for Anti-DNA (DS) AB QN @ 13 (reference range was 0-9). RNP antibodies was .9 with reference range of 0-0.9.



Symptoms that MAY be of note: headaches (pain stems from my jaw and wraps around the back of my head), always 2/day. Horrible hip and back pain (assumed this was just my life now after 2 babies back to back). One hip tends to get kind of stuck with certain movements, and I have to work it back in place slowly. A couple of my ribs move out of place (a low one on each side) when I bend certain ways (super painful, but I can push them back in and they will just be a little tender for a bit after) - only maybe once a month. Pain in my fingers, wrists, feet, knees, shoulders (mostly dull ache or stiffness, nothing I can't live with).



Random other things of note: a couple of small spots inside my nose that will not heal up and go away. They scab over, eventually the scab will break free when I blow my always semi-runny/stuffy nose, and then they are just a sore again. My rheumatologist said I probably have Hidradenitis Suppurativa, due to two boils on my butt that never completely heal (and 2 smaller ones on panty line). Horrible face acne for the past few years. My husband thinks the redness on my face looks like the butterfly rash (only red sometimes, not usually bothersome). A different rash that would come and go but I never thought much of it. Anxiety/depression have been a battle off and on for years, but I had been pretty good on that front for years until all of this kind of brought it back.



Saw rheumatologist and that appointment was kind of humiliating. Most symptoms had settled down significantly since appt with family doc. I felt like a fool. He didn't read my list of symptoms (and disregarded many that I told him), but prescribed meloxicam 10mg and ordered blood work. Told me right off that my family doc shouldn't have said lupus, because it was probably false positives. This was March 2018. 

His blood work came back, ANA negative - titer <1:40. RNP antibody negative, >20 EIA value. Only positive was HISTONE ANTIBODIES @ 3 EIA value (>1.5 is strong positive). That and signs of a UTI. He didn't answer when I asked about the Histone antibodies (I hadn't been on medication to indicate drug induced lupus). He said I could have an autoimmune disease, but we may very well never know what. But definitely didn't look like lupus.



Next winter, I had been dealing with a rash. It was sporadic and only came on at night (except for like 3 times), multiple nights a week. It was deep red, clear lines, and after it came on it didn't spread. It didn't itch, but I would have labored breathing every time (just like I couldn't catch my breath). Rash would last about 2 hours and be gone. Changed everything we could think of in case of an allergic reaction. No change. This went on for about 3 months while some of the joint pain and stiffness returned. 



Went to see a rheumatologist/allergist in Jan 2019 to try to sort out the rash. She was pretty sure it was the wine I drank a couple nights a week. But it wasn't only when I drank wine. And it wouldn't always happen then. She didn't think it was anything else. But she did order an AVISE CTD test through exagen labs. 



ANA IgG Positive @ 35 units (reference range on testing says ELISA 20-59 - Positive). The Titer was left blank. No nuclear pattern and no cytoplasmic pattern observed.

Anti - carbamylated Protein IgG Positive @ 35 units (reference range says ELISA >20 - Positive). Everything else negative except for UTI-looking #s in urine again. I've had UTI half my life, usually not bothered.

Metabolic panels, CBC, etc all within normal ranges. Hand X-Rays showed no signs of significant abnormalities. 



Lost my insurance in early 2019. Just got on government insurance. Hands are getting very painful and stiff again. Pain in first knuckle of big toe often again. Fatigue is constant again. Rashes barely coming up any more. But my damn hands hurt!! I just want to know if it is worth going back to the rheumatologist based on my blood work or if I am a hypochondriac. If I am a hypochondriac, I can accept that and deal with it and live through the aches. No big deal, I've done it for years. But if my blood work looks like there could be a real problem with me, I want to see another dr so that I can be a better mom and wife. The rheumatologists I've seen didn't seem concerned with my blood work, but my anxiety is telling me to point it out to someone!

"Hi!

Premature rupture of membranes, GBS positive, midwife directed augmentation attempts X11 hours failed to start labor, transfer to hospital. Pitocin overnight by 8 am (\~24 hours PROM) had not had a break from the contractions in over 1.5 hours was trying not to cry. Intrauterine pressure monitor inserted - determined that uterus was not relaxing between contractions. Got epidural and they dialed back the pitocin a lot. Rested a few hours - complete, complete by early afternoon. Attempted to labor down the rest of the day. pushed 1.5 hours, rested 1 hour pushed almost 2 hours. Foreceps attempt - unable to get one of the paddles in between the baby and my pelvis Agonizing experience even with the epidural. All this an he only got down to +1 station. 

C-section key statements from report paraphrased:

low transverse - midline extension and far lateral extension to ""within millimeters of right uterine artery."" No imbricating layer (not exactly sure what that means but she told me she could only do 1 layer of sutures). Hemostasis eventually achieved (900 ml loss). 

What I want to know:

How common is it to need to do both a T and a J incision in the same uterus/delivery? 

Was it because the PROM with OP positioning?

How common is it to have only 1 layer of suture?

How safe is it for me to try to have any more babies?

	Are these studies enough to merit having an ultrasound to monitor wound healing?

5’5” Weight steady at 174lbs (pre pregnancy and up until 4-5 weeks ago). Now 163lbs.

8 months postpartum, healthy pregnancy, c-section delivery due to fetal distress. Baby on solids but continues to breastfeed 5-7 times a day.

Exercise 3-5 times a week. Dairy free diet due to baby having an intolerance, but have started to reintroduce it into my diet within the last 2 weeks. Not a lot of snacking or eating out due to pandemic.

PMhx: Depression & anxiety (well managed with therapy and 75mg sertraline OD), migraines rarely (no meds). Otherwise healthy. No known allergies.


I have lost 11 lbs in the last month unintentionally (was planning to wait until finished breastfeeding to try to lose weight). While I am happy to be heading to a healthier weight, I am concerned as I haven’t been attempting weight loss. I’ve had night sweats off and on since giving birth (currently getting them nightly) and the last couple weeks I’ve been very nauseous. I have thrown up a few times, and feel sick after eating most meals. I don’t have much of an appetite currently.

I have taken many pregnancy tests and they’ve all been negative.

I just had my first postpartum period 2 weeks ago and around that time also started slowly reintroducing dairy into my diet. Before and during my period my appetite definitely increased.

I don’t want to go to the doctor if it isn’t needed due to the current climate, but it’s always been drilled in my head that unexplained weight loss and night sweats = trouble, so I’m a little nervous.

Other than the nausea issue and night sweats I feel well. No fatigue, no other symptoms I’ve noticed.

I would love to know if this can be explained by hormones and/or diet and/or pandemic stress, or if I should see my family doctor (and if so can it wait).

I was told by two different doctors in my youth (once at ~10 and once at ~18) that I do not have Marfan's. They had me do the wrist and thumb tests, but nothing more.

My PVCs started in 2018. I had an echocardiogram done when getting my PVCs investigated (in 2018). They said my valves and etc were all looking normal.

However, I keep hearing about these ""signs"" that I posted photos of, and wonder if I really *do* have it.

I am: slim built, long-fingered, long-faced, long-everything'd, high palate, combined scoliosis.

But I also have: high foot arches (not flat), not flexible in my legs (can't touch my toes), not *too* bad eyesight (I don't need my glasses when reading or at the computer, half my family has much worse).

Speaking of family: My dad's side is ALL extremely tall and lanky. My female cousin has Ehlers-Danlos. My dad has detached both his retinas and has ""a big heart"" and a murmur- but he is not diagnosed with anything (he avoids doctors).

I wouldn't be worried about it except for the whole ""your heart could literally explode at any minute"" thing.

I'm also looking to have kids in the near future, so I am also concerned that if it goes undetected, it could end badly there.

General Anxiety Disorder/Postpartum Anxiety  

FDLP: unknown; neg pregnancy test using Mirena

Overall Feeling:  

Feel well, have been tired and fatigue but figure it is related to mental health. Dealing with anxiety and some seasonal depression.   

Concerns with random bruises but assume it would be related to low iron  

GI Issues (PCP suspects IBS-D, but wants to focus on addressing my anxiety to see how/if GI issues improve)  

No fever/No Flu-like symptoms/Feel healthy overall (temp at time of blood draw was 97.7 F)

I went in last week for my annual physical as well as to discuss wanting to lose weight and family history of heart attacks with PCP. Have not had an established PCP in approximately 10 years so do not have any baseline blood work to compare. I requested that my OB send all the blood work from my pregnancy in 2018 to new my PCP, (not sure if this is relevant but I had HELLP Syndrome, severe anemia (had two iron transfusions prior to my delivery) and gestational diabetes during my pregnancy.

Anyways I got the lab results back from the appointment there are some abnormal results in my bloodwork, and I am curious if I should be concerned about the results. My PCP said no news is good news but since there are some flags about abnormalities I don’t know if I will be getting a call. I am not asking for a diagnosis, but I am curious if these abnormal results point to areas of concern and should I anticipate hearing from my doctor?

"hi I’m 18f, 5’5, 117lbs, white
recently I’ve been having some abdominal pain that hasn’t gone away. I started having them last Friday the 27th. I thought maybe it was me ovulating, bc I normally flush out during ovulation and it was my fertile window at the time, but I rarely get related cramps. A day later however I noticed maybe it wasn’t ovulation cramps but my colon, so I took some Dulcolax in hope maybe I’m just constipated. Well it didn’t work until the following day, the 29th, yet it’s still there this morning (30th) and I can’t sleep bc it’s still painful. 
I can’t seem to determine where the pain is coming from. I feel it everywhere in the abdomen and pelvic region. I’ve been letting out gas but it’s not enough. 

Some background is that I had unprotected sex March 7th, 4 days before my period. I did end up getting my regular length period (7 days). Though due to stress I have different flows, but with some of the worst cramps ever. It’s typical for me. My bf didn’t even finish and we only did it for a couple minutes bc I thought I might pass out, so I know my possibilities of getting pregnant was low. Even then i don’t even think it’s possible to get pregnant with no ejaculation, plus an egg that’s already going through the process of shedding with the lining. I can’t go out and get a pregnancy test due to city lockdown, but idk if it’s necessary. 
Also since lockdown I’ve been missing breakfast. Probably my most important meal when school was going on, but no longer wake up for it. but food consumption has been alright, I’m not overeating and not taking in as much junk food. 

What could this pain be from? 
Ovulation? Constipation? Pregnancy? They all seem to blend together with what I’m dealing with. I truly don’t know and it’s been keeping me up for the past 4 days. 
I appreciate all advice and comments, just trying to eliminate my options here. Thank you.
I will go to the doctor soon if this doesn’t clear out btw.",18.0,7.792702760901031,18.0,0.103,0.834,0.063,-0.9537,1971,4,1.6346611648944611,1.8539999999999999
"Hello, first I need to say english is not my first language so I might not use the proper words to describe my problems here, feel free to ask me for clarifications when needed.   
I'm a 43yo female, I don't drink, don't smoke, I'm not obese (5'7  163lbs) I exercise regularly, I have a genetic disposition to diabetes which causes me to control my diet since very young and I take metformin (slow release 1g/day) for insulin resistance. Over the past couple of years I have been experiencing a spike on my blood pressure during my period, I've always retained a lot of liquid during it ever since I was young to the point that ppl would comment on my ""weight gain"" during it and on my ""weight loss"" when it was over, never bothered me until it started to cause this spike on bp, I've been to a cardiologist that asked many tests done, he deemed my heart healthy and dismissed me, I've been to a gynecologist who wanted me to go on the pill which I declined because it always makes me feel worse, I've been to a endocrinologist who asked me for tests and also couldn't find anything wrong, my hormonal levels are always normal (except for vit D which I'm currently taking and triglycerides which sometimes comes slightly over the normal I imagine due to the insulin resistance and spironolactone for my water retention on my period. It doesn't seem to have anything dangerously wrong with me but I have no quality of life, I experience frequent heart palpitations, I wake up in the middle of the night with the heart racing, I'm constantly feeling an uneasy sensation in the chest that I can't describe, and I fear I'll end up having a heart attack even though every test suggested I have a healthy heart. I'm on my last straw here and I want to know if anyone can suggest me another specialty I can look for or another approach to a doctor so I can figure out how to make this symptoms go away (heart palpitations, heart racing, extreme headache even with low bp, spikes in bp - I have a machine and often during these times it can go from 150/90 to 12/90 in one minute) 

Another informations about me: I had a pregnancy at 34 (c-section delivery), don't have any allergies or take any other medications besides metformin and vitamins. My mother is diabetic and has high blood pressure, she went through menopause at around 45 (I think this could be where I'm heading too)   


Any help is appreciated, I fear sleeping now.",17.0,7.965099996652641,17.0,0.07,0.806,0.124,0.9849,2431,0,0.5644706072090961,1.1900000000000002
"Background:

My mom (65F) has had migraines with auras since puberty.  I don't know her medication history.  I (38F) began getting migraines in my early 20s with auras a few years after starting the pill. I'm wondering the likelihood estrogen will be an issue for my child.

I recall taking orthotricyclen and mircette in 2000-2005 before starting nortrel around 2006. While on nortrel, I had weird neurological symptoms including feeling like gravity was too strong -- I fell in an elevator when it went up and it was really hard to go up stairs. Switching to taking it at night helped, but I eventually stopped it entirely to conceive. I had two children - 2007 and 2010, but can't recall what I used for birth control between them. My second delivery included tubal ligation, but I used nuvaring to even my moods until about 2012 or 13. 

Not including pregnancy, I averaged one ""migraine"" with auras per year. I believe they began while taking nortrel, but they were mild at first - only auras, then a nap. Then I began having a ""bruised"" feeling after the nap. But each was worse than the last and they were severe by 2012. That's when a friend mentioned that if I get auras, I shouldn't be taking hormonal b.c.  My ob/gyn was horrified that I hadn't mentioned my migraines and discontinued the hormones immediately.  I haven't had any auras or light-sensitive headaches similar to the migraines since then. PMDD has been terrible, but I'm given to understand the risk of stroke isn't worth benefits to mood. (I'm already on an SNRI.)

Now my child (12, assigned male at birth) has come out as transgender. Personality-wise, this kid is my mini-me. We've always been on the same wavelength. We are similarly neurodiverse in that we're both aspie (child has formal autism dx, but I do not.) 

Should I fear estrogen for my child, when ready? I worry that the hormone replacement therapy necessary to transitioning medically will lead to debilitating or risky neurological effects. But I don't know differences in dosages, etc. Or how heritable this sort of thing is.  High blood pressure runs on both sides of the family, as well.",17.0,8.137175083298217,17.0,0.093,0.856,0.051,-0.9533,2144,1,1.8231719270731228,1.581
"20F, 5""4 (163cm), about 130 lbs (59 kg) 

I drink about 5 glasses of wine a week now that quarantine has started, depending on the week. 

2 months ago I had the following procedures:
- Hysteroscopy with currettage (they wanted to collect samples from my uterus)
- Not sure what it's called but they put blue dye through my fallopian tubes to check for blockage. No blockage was found
- Laporoscopy with excision of 2 endometriosis lesions on a ligament holding the uterus and in the douglas pouch.

2 months before the surgery, I stopped taking visanne (0.2mg dienogest), as instructed by the specialist. I had my regular (horrible) periods again, with my 28 day cycle. My first period after surgery was right on time and business as usual (lots of blood and pain yay).

I was having pain after surgery due to overgrowth of Ureaplasma parvum and gardnarella bacteria. My gyn (specialist post OP appointment was cancelled due to Covid) perscribed me a 7 day course of Doxycycline and Dalacin V. I finished the course about 2 weeks ago. That pretty much cleared up the issue. I am thinking this could be the cause, since this has been the only change since my previous period. 

My 2nd period after the surgery should have happened 10 days ago. But nothing happened. No PMS, no ovulation cramps, nothing.... I had mild spotting (like a couple drops/smear) about 5 days ago but nothing since then. I was worried I could be pregnant, but 3 pregnancy tests have come up negative now. My partner and I only had sex a few times since the surgery, and are relying on condoms. The last time we had sex was 3 weeks ago, so tests should be showing up positive if I was pregnant.

There hasn't been any major changes since my last period. Quarantine has been going on a while, even during my last period. No weight change. No change in stress, or routine or anything in the last couple months. Tbh i'm super happy not to have my period but I am worried what could be causing it. 

Should I be contacting my specialist ? Or my gyn ?

"Hello. I’m 34 weeks pregnant and within the past month my entire body has become extremely itchy and it’s getting worse. I’ve already been tested for cholestasis and preeclampsia and both came back negative. I’ve tried so many different lotions and creams (eucerine, suave cocoa butter, burts bees mama belly butter, straight coconut oil, curel medicated itch cream, aveeno oatmeal lotion, Shea butter) gold bond itching powder, aloe Vera gel, witch hazel etc. My OB prescribed me 2.5% hydrocortisone cream which I’ve admittedly only been using for a day. She also had me try 0.05% betamethasone diporpionate lotion for a week twice a day. None of those have worked at all. She has me taking Zyrtec in the morning and Benadryl every night as well as spraying my nose with Flonase twice a day in case it’s seasonal allergy related (edit: I can’t take the medication that usually is the most effective for my allergies because it’s not pregnancy safe)

I’ve been taking ice cold showers and using frozen peas on the itchiest spots. My entire body head to toe is itchy (I mean including my labia, in the shells of my ears, between my fingers etc the worst being my stomach, legs, butt and recently my back near my armpits) and I don’t know what to do. I’m writing this in tears because I’m so uncomfortable. I wake up with bloody from scratching in my sleep. I get colorless bumps on my skin when I finally give in and scratch but I think it’s just from [irritating my skin so badly](https://imgur.com/a/KNqhEb3)I’ve had no change in diet, soaps, detergents, activity, hygiene, regular medications etc. I’m at a loss. I want to be tested for cholestasis again because I’m scared it was wrong and will cause complications to my pregnancy.

I’m meeting with a dermatologist tomorrow for advice but it’s a video conference so I don’t know how helpful it will be. Hopefully she has some ideas. Does anyone have any ideas on what else this could be and how I can relieve this?

Other medications I’m on for mental health issues, hypothyroidism and pregnancy that I’ve been on for years:

I'm hoping someone here can help me. My main problem right now is I have this ""whooshing"" pulsing sound in my left ear. I've had this problem on-and-off for the past few years. This sound tends to occur around the same time as when I'm having major headaches, which will be daily and usually last weeks or months. I also used to have painless ocular migraines quite frequently, but I haven't had one in a while. I started another ""headache flare"" (for lack of a better word) a few weeks ago, and have been treating with tylenol to get through the day. Today when I started hearing the sound again, for the first time in a while, I realized I think its my heartbeat, it seems to match my pulse. It is extremely annoying, and makes it very difficult to fall asleep.

My last headache flare was last winter, and it probably lasted a few months. I also had the whooshing sound in my ear quite often (usually left ear, I think), but I didn't know how to describe it to anyone. I went to an urgent care one day when my headache was unbearable, and the doctor said it was probably birth control and gave me some muscle relaxers. I didn't mention the ear thing because I didn't know how to explain it.

A few months later I became pregnant. I lost the baby at 20 weeks June 1, and two sets of blood tests indicate that I have Antiphospholipid Syndrome. I don't know if this is relevant. Hematology is full until December so I don't really have a ""go-to"" person for this other than my OB.

I am seeing a PA on Saturday at my primary care office, but should I be concerned about anything in the short term with this? Could it be related to Antiphospholipid Syndrome, or is it something else entirely? I hate stressing about my health, but I also don't want to visit the doctor more than I need to.

- no fecal incontinence
- some very mild urinary stress incontinence
- 3A tear I think occured due to positioning and baby size. I had a midwife assisted delivery in a midwife run unit within a hospital. Baby got a bit stuck and I think was in distress so I was encouraged to squat over a birth stool. Then they said something about him being a bit stuck (not sure if it was a shoulder) but they used their hands to pull him out. Baby weighed 4.2kg. (I think if I was in a normal labour ward I probably would've had an episiotomy or some sort of instruments).
- 6 week check up at the hospital an obstatrician said I should never give birth naturally again due to high risk of worse damage. I've had no other follow up except for recently seeing a pelvic floor physio
- advice so far has been a bit inconsistent. Some of the health professionals have been suggesting I may have a slight increased risk of a tear again but not necessarily, others have been giving me more strong warnings against the idea of a natural birth
- not had anorectal manometry (and may not be able to, the hospital unit where they perform them have said they don't like to do this on pregnant people due to a risk of miscarriage
- current pregnancy IVF due to suspected endometriosis (1st pregnancy spontaneous, thought is hormonal birth control controlled the endo and I never went back on it after birth of my first child)
- maybe also relevant is that I have anxiety. This isn't generally very obvious to others or even to me most of the time these days, but interacting with health professionals I find triggering



Can't fully articulate why but I am really uncomfortable with the idea of a c-section. Maybe the recovery? Maybe feeling detached from the birth? Not sure. First birth I felt really strongly about having as intervention free natural birth as possible, and I still feel a bit attached to this vision. I've always perceived natural birth to be very beneficial to the baby. But, on the other hand, obviously a little scared of a future of feacal incontinence!


My question is am I crazy for even considering a natural birth? I feel like I'm clouded with anxiety right now and can't make a decision. I've got a few months to go but I don't want to be obsessing over this the whole time.

"34F

5’5” Weight steady at 174lbs (pre pregnancy and up until 4-5 weeks ago). Now 163lbs.

8 months postpartum, healthy pregnancy, c-section delivery due to fetal distress. Baby on solids but continues to breastfeed 5-7 times a day.

Exercise 3-5 times a week. Dairy free diet due to baby having an intolerance, but have started to reintroduce it into my diet within the last 2 weeks. Not a lot of snacking or eating out due to pandemic.

PMhx: Depression & anxiety (well managed with therapy and 75mg sertraline OD), migraines rarely (no meds). Otherwise healthy. No known allergies.


I have lost 11 lbs in the last month unintentionally (was planning to wait until finished breastfeeding to try to lose weight). While I am happy to be heading to a healthier weight, I am concerned as I haven’t been attempting weight loss. I’ve had night sweats off and on since giving birth (currently getting them nightly) and the last couple weeks I’ve been very nauseous. I have thrown up a few times, and feel sick after eating most meals. I don’t have much of an appetite currently.

I have taken many pregnancy tests and they’ve all been negative.

I just had my first postpartum period 2 weeks ago and around that time also started slowly reintroducing dairy into my diet. Before and during my period my appetite definitely increased.

I don’t want to go to the doctor if it isn’t needed due to the current climate, but it’s always been drilled in my head that unexplained weight loss and night sweats = trouble, so I’m a little nervous.

Other than the nausea issue and night sweats I feel well. No fatigue, no other symptoms I’ve noticed.

I would love to know if this can be explained by hormones and/or diet and/or pandemic stress, or if I should see my family doctor (and if so can it wait).

"I am 41, female, 5'5"", 150 lbs and no underlying health conditions other than PTSD and anxiety. I'm allergic to everything in the avelox family as well as lexapro and prozac (and doc said to just avoid all SSRI's since lexapro and prozac cause tachycardia), and need to avoid caffeine because it also causes tachycardia (particularly from drinks like Bai and beachbody pre-workout powder).

I had a telehealth appointment with my doctor on Monday (in place of my annual physical until I can safely reschedule), and she told me to take either 2 pepcid/zantac or 1 omeprazole per day for 2 weeks. I am wondering if these drugs actually heal my stomach or simply mask symptoms, a la tylenol not actually healing injuries but instead just masking the pain. I'd rather not take anything if it's just going to mask the symptoms and not actually heal anything. 

I did read this morning that Zantac has been recalled due to increased risk for cancer-causing properties the longer it sits on a shelf(?). I have 4 leftover bottles of omeprazole from when she previously prescribed it to me to take regularly for several months several years ago. Two bottles expired in December 2019 and two expired in February 2020, so I'm using those first. I took one pill yesterday morning on an empty stomach, and one pill this morning on an empty stomach waiting 30 minutes to eat thereafter. So, I'm wondering if I should be ordering a brand new box of pepcid instead of the expired omeprazole. 

I tend to start to get ulcer like symptoms after consuming acidic foods and beverages, which I've had more of lately since I'm not able to be too picky about what food we have in the house now. But I did have a glass of wine and a few ounces of hard cider last week, and a sip of my significant other's coffee, so that probably kicked this into high gear. 

I've been having issues with my food getting stuck in the back of my throat while I'm eating and having to cough it back up a little and take a sip of water to properly swallow it. I mentioned this to my doctor Monday, and she said this is caused by acid reflux. I don't feel particularly refluxy, so I was surprised by this, but happy to try the medication for 2 weeks to see if it helps. She also told me to stop eating fatty foods, cheese, simple white carbs and spicy food, and sugar. 

Doc also prescribed me 0.5 mg of loreazepam, but I can't pick it up, since ""controlled substances"" do not qualify for pharmacy delivery.

"Hey there,

Ok, first I'm a 31yo female, 167cm, 120kg, I have PCOS along with the following. I have a child who was born naturally almost 10 years ago, and do have problems with a prolapse due to birth (36h labour, 2.5h pushing, episiotomy and suction assisted birth). 

So I'm pretty medically sufficient due to having long term and short term health conditions and having a strong interest in anatomy and physiology.

Relevant medical history for this particular issue is Degenerative Disc Disease which has caused nerve root compression from a herniated disc at L4-L5 and nerve root compression from osteophyte formation at L5-S1. This has caused severe chronic pain, severe Sciatic pain and mobility issues. 

So far I have tried several different medications to have with the pain, including Targin and Endone together, however have found an effective regime with Panadeine Forte and Naproxen. A list of all meds I take are:
Panadeine Forte (2 x 4-6 time a day)
Naproxen (1 tablet twice a day)
Esomeprazole (40mg x day)
Sertraline (200mg a day)
Endep (2 tablets at night)
Diazepam (5-10mg as needed)
Ural (urine alkaliser, two sachets I've a day when needed).
I have also had a spinal nerve injection (corticosteroid I think) at the L5-S1 level as a diagnostic tool for the neurosurgeon and spinal specialist team. It didn't help the pain at all, in fact it made it worse for 7/8 days, then my pain lowered to its usual level.

I think that's all of it. OKAY into the issue. 

I have what I can only describe as an irritable bladder - the feeling is the same as a UTI but without the other symptoms; there is no fever, no burning on urination. It just feels like a full bladder all the time. 

Ural, a urine alkaliser available over the counter, seems to help settle the feeling down, but otherwise it's 24h a day, and has been going on for about two months. It started before the nerve injection. I do recall noticing a slight improvement in the bladder issue after the injection for a day or two, then it returned.

The problem is, I have this stupid anxiety/fear about urine and stool sample tests. I did mention to my doctor a month or so ago and he gave me a dose of antibiotics which didn't seem to help. I know my doc will need a urine sample and is likely to ask me to do a 24h urine test... But even the thought of that is terrifying to me for some reason. It's irrational, I know. 

Is there anyone on here who can help me? I do see my Dr every fortnight (I'm in Australia) so I will mention it, but I just need to know if there's anything else I can try at home. I've tried increasing my water intake (2-4 700ml bottles a day) which hasn't helped.",10.0,8.669502205278526,10.0,0.083,0.858,0.059,-0.9112,2689,1,1.40654126419251,0.8300000000000001
"I hope this is the right place for my question/quandary.

My wife (29f) and I (33m) are preparing to start reproducing in the very near future.  Like many persons in the developed world, we both spent a long time developing our personal and professional lives, at the sacrifice of intentionality delaying our plans to reproduce.  Like many in similar situations, she is now starting to feel ""under the gun"" to get the baby making done sooner than later.

I want to provide the best possible life my offspring, and we are prepared in many ways to enable this, however one lingering concern remains for me: my wife's current physical condition is not exactly what one would describe as ""fit"".  Reading scholarly articles [like this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983896/) has made me particularly concerned about the potential life long neurological and metabolic effects on a prospective child.

I am also aware of the widely known fetal development risks related to maternal age.  Therein is the quandary.  Do we push to make babes as soon as possible to preempt any age related difficulties, or do we focus on her fitness until she's no longer obese or overweight before conceiving?

I understand that this can be an especially sensitive topic for many, so I will reiterate for absolute clarity: my sole concern in this line of inquiry is to ensure the best possible long term health and quality of life outcome for any prospective future children.


**TL;DR**

33m and 29f planning for near future conception;  29f is currently overweight or obese, but urgently wants to ""beat the clock"" on age related pregnancy complications, while 33m is hesitant due to evidence-backed concerns about potential fetal development issues and lifelong negative health outcomes for offspring due to maternal obesity during gestation.

My child was diagnosed with Croup, almost 2 weeks ago. He had the classic croup cough, and I had laryngitis. Told by GP to just monitor him. He was given two doses of a steroid. During this course, his cough started to change and he started struggling to breathe and would vomit constantly due to the coughing. I brought him into the hospital as he was using his accessory muscles to breathe. Doctor told me in ER that he was using his accessory muscles but it was because his nose was congested, so recommended saline and nose frida. My husband and I did that, but our son continued to worsen with his cough. He would have huge coughing fits that would cause him to struggle to breathe. My last straw was when I was home with him and his lips started going blue because he was choking. I flipped him over on his stomach and started hitting his back and he puked up a lot of mucus. I rushed him to the hospital. They swabbed him for RSV, Influenza and Pertussis. Paediatrician started him on an antibiotic while we wait for the the pertussis results. He is admitted to hospital, with low fever, high heart rate and low sp02. He requires sp02 when sleeping but never when awake. We stay 3 days and then the last day he was napping on his own without requiring oxygen. My husband and I have an owlet that monitors heart rate and oxygen. We hadn't used it before but thought this would be good. The nurse told me if he fell lower than 90 to bring him in immediately as once they fall, they can really fall. No alarms go off in the night, baby is sleeping in our room. A few coughing fits but nothing bad. I look at the results over night. His average sp02 was 92. He was typically 91-97 for most of the night, but there was an hour over night he went from 86-89, then back up to 91.

For context - I have some issues with anxiety, a lot revolving around illness and lateness, so if I think something is wrong with me or I'm waiting for something like test results (or my period...) I can become nervous and distracted, not usually to an extent that affects me physically.

Essentially my period is well over a month late, almost at the point where I have skipped the period and the next one should be due soon. I've been feeling gassy/nauseous at different times of day and nervous, and sometimes my boobs/nipples feel a little sore - obviously pregnancy could be the answer but I use a contraceptive implant and my partner and I also use condoms. I have taken four pregnancy tests from different brands, two this week and two last week - all negative - but nothing seems to make me feel better or reassure me I'm not pregnant. I know it's highly unlikely but every day my period doesn't show up I become more convinced. Could anyone give a second opinion on the symptoms and let me know if this is usual for people using implants? Is it possible? I know stress can impact the menstrual cycle and I am sometimes irregular but it's rare I skip altogether. I would appreciate any advice or feedback that might make me stop worrying a little.

This may get wordy... To begin, I have the Mirena and it has been in place for two years. On August 11th I had the sex. The following occurred: One week after sex- Started having dizzy spells. Felt gross. About week and a half after- Dizzy (fainting) got so bad I was sent to the ER. Diagnosed with vitamin deficiency (pregnancy test taken and was negative.)

It was on and off for days. My gut told me to take a pregnancy test (about two weeks post sex). It was negative. I didn’t consider a pregnancy possible, not with an IUD, so I let the idea leave my mind. I was spotting for a few more days. This spotting was fairly heavy. My boobs were so sore. I threw up a couple times. I continued spotting lightly for over a week. I was extremely tired, would have waves of vertigo and hot flashes, and bouts of nausea. I began cramping (this is now about 5 weeks) and had really painful lower back pain. I (sorry ladies) don’t ever, ever have cramps. The back pain was a surprise as I hadn’t done anything to cause it. Then, diarrhea. Then, the most heavy period I have ever had. Extreme clots. This lasted five days, which is where I am now. I went to Planned Parenthood and I tested negative (urine test) for a pregnancy. The doctor said that because I have an IUD and I never had a positive pregnancy test, that it was unlikely this was a chemical pregnancy. She also said she wasn’t sure what was happening. She put me on a high dose of progesterone and told me to pay close attention to my flow and if it gets heavier I should go to the hospital. Guys, when I say heavy flow I mean heavy flow. Clots. I can literally push them out.

I want to add one more thing, you can dig it or not. I got pregnant and had a very healthy baby in 2016. About a week before I found out I was pregnant with my daughter I had very extreme emotions. Not just depression (which I have) but some serious anxiety and a desire to put myself in a secure and healthy environment, which I was in, but this was a desire to care for my body. The night before I took my positive pregnancy test I, who was a heavy drinker at the time (I’m 9 months sober now. Heyooo!) took a chug of Whiskey and I was absolutely disgusted. The next morning I took a pregnancy test. I had absolutely no reason to believe I was pregnant. It was just a weird gut feeling, and sure enough it was positive.

I have had this exact feeling for the last two weeks. I didn’t put two and two together until I started bleeding so heavily. I know this sounds silly, but I am very active in keeping mindful and working on my mental health, and when these feelings arose I felt very uncomfortable, unmanageable, and I packed a bag and went to my parents to “get healthy.”

"Hi all, 

29 female

live in the Southwest USA. 

Had a baby 18 months ago with pretty significant episiotomy (early labor was rapid due to a placental abruption). Stopped breastfeeding about 1 month ago. 

No meds currently aside from OTC allergy meds. 

History of IBS, but no symptoms since I got pregnant (it’s a miracle!) 

History of Bipolar type II. Currently very well controlled. 

Edit: I’m 5’5”, 130 lbs. I also have an IUD and have not had a true period since Sep 2017 when I got pregnant. 



Problem: so, a few days ago I developed a painful “bump” in my perineum area. It’s almost more like a “flap” of skin/tissue than a bump. It’s very painful and sensitive. It also is causing itching. 

No bleeding, and does not LOOK like images of hemorrhoids I see online. It’s more of an elongated “flap” I guess and it extends from my anus towards my vagina. It does not reach all the way to the vaginal opening though. There do appear to be some smaller bulges around my actual anus, but not large and those don’t hurt. 

It’s also not red or purple like images of hemorrhoids online show. It’s just kind of flesh colored like all the other skin around it. But maybe a little red in an irritated or inflamed way. My husband has had an internal hemorrhoid since birth that sometimes bulges out and he looked at mine and said it looks totally different. (I’ve never looked at his anus. Lol). 

In looking online, honestly the closest thing I could find that looks similar is “perineal pyramidal protrusion” but everything I read says that occurs only in young children. That’s what it looks similar to, though. 

The most concerning thing to me is that I now also have really tender lymph nodes on both sides of my groin. The right one may be slightly swollen, but they’re both very tender. 

The right lymph node does occasionally swell randomly (maybe once a year for a few days) and I’ve had it looked at via ultrasound in the past (maybe 6 years ago) and was told it was normal. Was told as long as it was just one side and not persistent it was ok. But now both sides are tender and it’s coinciding with the appearance of this super uncomfortable ... lump ... in my perineum. 

Could this be a hemorrhoid? Do hemorrhoids get infected (causing the lymph node symptoms)? 

Could it possibly be something related to my hx of episiotomy? It doesn’t extend all the way to my vagina, but it does KIND OF look like it could be scar tissue that’s really inflamed/swollen?? Is that even possible 18 months later? 

Google is scaring me with all the potential episiotomy complications! 

Treatment: so far I’ve been applying hemorrhoid cream for a few days and it doesn’t seem to be helping. It seems to be getting worse. Definitely more painful. Today I added in Gold Bond on top of the cream to help with some of the pain. 

I can’t get into my PCP until next Tuesday so I’m trying to tough it out but just want to make sure I’m not ignoring something that may be more serious?

Edit: I also have none of the risk factors for hemorrhoid I don’t think. Have not strained to have a bowel movement, no excessive diarrhea,  no pregnancy or obesity, no anal sex.  We did have regular vaginal sex the evening prior to this showing up, but it wasn’t anything crazy. I’ve had some vagina pain with sex since giving birth, but this time it was not out of the ordinary.",11.0,9.086073368284524,11.0,0.118,0.784,0.098,-0.9436,3402,7,1.2039587797163553,1.298

"35F, 5'9"", 273lbs., no medication, non-smoker, two pregnancies (c-sections), one appendectomy, current ventral hernia (2cmx3cm) causing a lot of pain on a weekly basis. 

I have a surgery scheduled this week to fix the hernia (laparoscopic). My concern is I have white coat hypertension (it is high at the beginning of appointments and drops to either normal or prehypertensive ranges by the end of my doctor visits). I'm assuming this means I experience periodic blood pressure spikes when I'm anxious/stressed. 

My surgeon is aware and he performed my appendectomy a few years ago. During presurgical testing this week, the PA said this would preclude me from having surgery if I am not relaxed enough the day of surgery (""They won't let you have the surgery if your numbers are like this""). When the ECG reading came out, she said it ""looked good""  so this wasn't a concern for me until I just read the results. All other presurgical testing was normal (blood counts, metabolic counts, etc.). My ECG has the following reading. When I see my GP's office, what are the chances they won't medically clear me? Should I just cancel it and not go through the embarrassing rigamarole? Thanks in advance.

I have lingering weakness possibly from being in the ICU 5 years ago, what should I do?

Before the ICU stay, I was finding it difficult to stand for a long time, I guess starting when I was 42-43ish. If I did, I found that I got stiff. Often, I would wake up in the morning, stiff. So I started doing stretches at work when I had a bit of a break, because I sit a lot at work.

So I had a baby 5 years ago, I had acute fatty liver of pregnancy, so I had liver failure causing them to deliver him at 36 weeks. After a rough first day in the NICU he is doing great. I had a lot of blood loss and they debated doing a liver transplant. I was in ICU for 3 days and another 10 days in the maternity unit while they waited for my liver to go to an acceptable level.

So from when I recovered, and was back at home, I found that it was difficult for me to go from sitting on the floor, to standing up.

I got a frozen shoulder when my baby was an infant, and did a lot of physio for that and it's okay now. I still do my arm physio exercises most days, and I also do ballet-style stretches with my legs. I asked my physio person about my back stiffness and those exercises I do not do regularly - lie on my back, bend my knees and tilt my legs to one side then the other. I get about 6000 steps in, in an average day, of getting to and from work and walking on my break.

Five years on, I still find it difficult to go from sitting on the floor to standing. I find it difficult to lean forward washing dishes at the sink, doing other things that involve bending to pick things off the floor etc. These things make me tired and achy. I was trying to listen to my body and rest and wait and kind of make my energy last longer. However I am really frustrated because I can't get my stuff done this way. I am not THAT old yet.

My doctor tested me for rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. But now she is suggesting that I take an SSRI. I disagree with this. I am depressed to a certain degree but I am able to manage my depression after all these years. I think I need a way to get stronger, or rule out other medical conditions. She thinks I need to do aerobic exercise. She is probably right but I have no energy to do this. I have a low thyroid and she does not want to discuss adjusting my medication for that, she won't tell me my levels when I ask. I don't know if that is pertinent. She tests my liver levels every year or so but I don't know what they are.

I think I need either a personal trainer, or a physiotherapist, to help me get stronger, but I don't know which one.

I need more detailed instruction than ""get aerobic exercise"" I know nothing about working out. Maybe I need to eat more protein. I don't want to hurt myself if I pick the wrong physical exercise professional. If I get a personal trainer, will they know if they are in over their head with me? What do you think?

"I work for a delivery company & I got bit on 1/30. The bite is 3 puncture wounds from the front teeth. The dog snuck up on me completely unprovoked & aggressive. There were 5 other dogs on the property (all Springer Spaniels) & they kept their cool. The punctures are about 1/4 inches deep & I saw a medical professional yesterday who wants me on antibiotics so an infection doesn't pop up. The police officer I was in contact with regarding the incident has confirmed that the dog has never been vaccinated. They live on a farm so it is possible for the dog to be scratched or bitten from a wild animal & is in the beginning stages of rabies. The officer also will not get back to me about if the dog is being quarantined or not. I'm in a situation where I have to decide if cautious is the right answer (I think it is) & if I'm being overly dramatic. This is all coming out of pocket for the expense so it would be about $3,000 for the full dosage. 

Should I get the vaccine? Is it too late for me to receive the proper treatment? What should I do? I'm terrified.

I don't know how to add a photo to show the bite wound. If you'd like to see it I can figure out how to add it for you.

"28F, Hispanic, 5ft, 117lbs. 

No current medical issues. Occasional drinking, no smoking or drug use, but I do take clonazapam (prescribed) occasionally for sleep issues, as well as birth control. I have been taking omeprazole for the past week, but it hasn’t really helped. 

I do have a history of GERD and stomach issues, as well as my mom and brother. 

I am planning to go to to the doctor, after I get short term health insurance, but if the pain/symptoms get worse, I’ll just have to go without.

I had my gallbladder removed about 6-7 years ago due to it not working properly and sludge (it wouldn’t close all the way). Things have mostly been fine and when they’re not, avoiding greasy foods usually helps and I’m okay.

I think it started maybe 2 weeks ago, but I’ve been vomiting after eating most foods, sometimes even when it’s blander food. I get full fast and then get stomach pains and need to throw up. The area between my ribs is also swollen.

There’s also just random stomach pains and it feels like spasms and if I move, it stretches and hurts more.

My mom also had her gallbladder removed years ago and said her doctor told her gallstones could still form in the vein that’s left after removal. Is this true?

There is also some lower back pain, I need to pay more attention and see if it’s on the same side or if it moves. Current pain is on lower right side of my back. 

I did take a pregnancy test and it’s negative. I’m not sure if this is related, but I’ve been having severe headaches as well.",5.0,8.044921278906944,5.0,0.139,0.782,0.079,-0.9669,1541,1,1.7592709783571703,0.6950000000000001
"Okay, I'll try not to make this super long while trying to include relevant information. I've been dealing with a handful of symptoms, off and on, for a couple of years now. I am 31F, white, 5'8 140 lbs, mom x 4. No meds, couple drinks every other weekend, no smoking/drugs. Decent exercise.



January of 2018, I went to my family doctor for first time in 6 years. Mostly for joint pain and stiffness in my hands, knees, feet - ongoing 2.5 months. Hands were worst-felt like a rubberband holding fingers tight. Also complained of always being tired and bad headaches daily. Dr. said to exercise more and I was tired because I had 4 young kids. Ran blood work and calls me and says ""Your blood work is in, it looks like you have lupus. I'm sending you to a rheumatologist."" Positive ANA and positive for Anti-DNA (DS) AB QN @ 13 (reference range was 0-9). RNP antibodies was .9 with reference range of 0-0.9.



Symptoms that MAY be of note: headaches (pain stems from my jaw and wraps around the back of my head), always 2/day. Horrible hip and back pain (assumed this was just my life now after 2 babies back to back). One hip tends to get kind of stuck with certain movements, and I have to work it back in place slowly. A couple of my ribs move out of place (a low one on each side) when I bend certain ways (super painful, but I can push them back in and they will just be a little tender for a bit after) - only maybe once a month. Pain in my fingers, wrists, feet, knees, shoulders (mostly dull ache or stiffness, nothing I can't live with).



Random other things of note: a couple of small spots inside my nose that will not heal up and go away. They scab over, eventually the scab will break free when I blow my always semi-runny/stuffy nose, and then they are just a sore again. My rheumatologist said I probably have Hidradenitis Suppurativa, due to two boils on my butt that never completely heal (and 2 smaller ones on panty line). Horrible face acne for the past few years. My husband thinks the redness on my face looks like the butterfly rash (only red sometimes, not usually bothersome). A different rash that would come and go but I never thought much of it. Anxiety/depression have been a battle off and on for years, but I had been pretty good on that front for years until all of this kind of brought it back.



Saw rheumatologist and that appointment was kind of humiliating. Most symptoms had settled down significantly since appt with family doc. I felt like a fool. He didn't read my list of symptoms (and disregarded many that I told him), but prescribed meloxicam 10mg and ordered blood work. Told me right off that my family doc shouldn't have said lupus, because it was probably false positives. This was March 2018. 

His blood work came back, ANA negative - titer <1:40. RNP antibody negative, >20 EIA value. Only positive was HISTONE ANTIBODIES @ 3 EIA value (>1.5 is strong positive). That and signs of a UTI. He didn't answer when I asked about the Histone antibodies (I hadn't been on medication to indicate drug induced lupus). He said I could have an autoimmune disease, but we may very well never know what. But definitely didn't look like lupus.



Next winter, I had been dealing with a rash. It was sporadic and only came on at night (except for like 3 times), multiple nights a week. It was deep red, clear lines, and after it came on it didn't spread. It didn't itch, but I would have labored breathing every time (just like I couldn't catch my breath). Rash would last about 2 hours and be gone. Changed everything we could think of in case of an allergic reaction. No change. This went on for about 3 months while some of the joint pain and stiffness returned. 



Went to see a rheumatologist/allergist in Jan 2019 to try to sort out the rash. She was pretty sure it was the wine I drank a couple nights a week. But it wasn't only when I drank wine. And it wouldn't always happen then. She didn't think it was anything else. But she did order an AVISE CTD test through exagen labs. 



ANA IgG Positive @ 35 units (reference range on testing says ELISA 20-59 - Positive). The Titer was left blank. No nuclear pattern and no cytoplasmic pattern observed.

Anti - carbamylated Protein IgG Positive @ 35 units (reference range says ELISA >20 - Positive). Everything else negative except for UTI-looking #s in urine again. I've had UTI half my life, usually not bothered.

Metabolic panels, CBC, etc all within normal ranges. Hand X-Rays showed no signs of significant abnormalities. 



Lost my insurance in early 2019. Just got on government insurance. Hands are getting very painful and stiff again. Pain in first knuckle of big toe often again. Fatigue is constant again. Rashes barely coming up any more. But my damn hands hurt!! I just want to know if it is worth going back to the rheumatologist based on my blood work or if I am a hypochondriac. If I am a hypochondriac, I can accept that and deal with it and live through the aches. No big deal, I've done it for years. But if my blood work looks like there could be a real problem with me, I want to see another dr so that I can be a better mom and wife. The rheumatologists I've seen didn't seem concerned with my blood work, but my anxiety is telling me to point it out to someone!

"Me: 27F, 5'0, 185lbs, no history of significant medical issues. No recent falls or head trauma. Currently on Junel for birth control and Zofran for the nausea that has surfaced 

Since Christmas, I've had a host of weird symptoms. Nausea, some confusion, becoming overheated easily, excessive fatigue, and some constipation issues. When the nausea surfaces, I have this weird back of head pain that permeates down into my neck and upper back. It's not a headache but more feels like I've pulled a muscle. It's dull and more annoying than being actually painful. It usually happens in the mornings. No, I'm not pregnant (doctor tested me twice and I tested myself once 😅)

On Christmas, the symptoms were really bad to where I didn't eat at all and did a lot of dry heaving into the toilet. I slept a lot too that day. I got a little better the next couple of days to where I could eat but then that following Sunday night after Christmas, I was vomiting and had diarrhea. Same weird head pain too. I only vomited twice but had the chills and a fever of 100.8 at my highest. The duration of symptoms lasted 48 hours. My husband, two days later, then exhibited similar symptoms (chills, fever, vomiting and diarrhea) and we both chalked it up to bring the stomach flu. My husband recovered completely within 36 hours. I got better too, but my nausea, weird head pain, becoming overheated and some constipation persisted to some degree so I saw my PCP at the end of that week (Jan 9 actually). Blood work showed markers for possibly an acute viral infection and my doctor advised me that if symptoms persisted, I head to the ER. That weekend, I felt better than I had since before Christmas so I didn't go to the ER. However, that following Tuesday (Jan 14), my symptoms of nausea and head pain (decreased but still present) returned and then subsided by the end of the day so I didn't call my doctor or go to the ER. I felt good the rest of the week until the following Tuesday (Jan 21), where I felt the same symptoms again, albeit the head pain even less so this time. I did call my doctor this time and she advised that I go to an urgent care. At the urgent care facility, I got checked for the third time for pregnancy (since I didn't have my period, which should have happened the week prior; negative again). My urine test though showed signs of a UTI, which I'm currently being treated for with antibiotics.

I'm currently experiencing nausea again, the first time since 1/21, but this time theres no weird head pain. Could a UTI have really caused my month-long weird symptoms? Anything else it might be? I didn't have my usual symptoms of UTI which, before when I had them and it's been awhile, I would only get the urgency to pee a lot. I'm really hoping that the UTI was the culprit all along and that my symptoms don't resurface. Also, I'm thinking that having the stomach flu in the midst of this weird illness was just a coincidence (my mom said she had it before me, so I probably just caught it from her)

"Basic info- 33, female, had one healthy pregnancy with vaginal delivery. 5’4” and 113 lbs.
Medications are Lexapro and Wellbutrin.
Don’t drink, don’t smoke. 

This may get wordy... To begin, I have the Mirena and it has been in place for two years. On August 11th I had the sex. The following occurred: One week after sex- Started having dizzy spells. Felt gross. About week and a half after- Dizzy (fainting) got so bad I was sent to the ER. Diagnosed with vitamin deficiency (pregnancy test taken and was negative.) Soon after- Began spotting, spotting in a way I had only ever experienced one time before, when I was pregnant. But this was a bit different. It fit right between spotting and a light period. It was on and off for days. My gut told me to take a pregnancy test (about two weeks post sex). It was negative. I didn’t consider a pregnancy possible, not with an IUD, so I let the idea leave my mind. I was spotting for a few more days. This spotting was fairly heavy. My boobs were so sore. I threw up a couple times. I continued spotting lightly for over a week. I was extremely tired, would have waves of vertigo and hot flashes, and bouts of nausea. I began cramping (this is now about 5 weeks) and had really painful lower back pain. I (sorry ladies) don’t ever, ever have cramps. The back pain was a surprise as I hadn’t done anything to cause it. Then, diarrhea. Then, the most heavy period I have ever had. Extreme clots. This lasted five days, which is where I am now. I went to Planned Parenthood and I tested negative (urine test) for a pregnancy. The doctor said that because I have an IUD and I never had a positive pregnancy test, that it was unlikely this was a chemical pregnancy. She also said she wasn’t sure what was happening. She put me on a high dose of progesterone and told me to pay close attention to my flow and if it gets heavier I should go to the hospital. Guys, when I say heavy flow I mean heavy flow. Clots. I can literally push them out.

I want to add one more thing, you can dig it or not. I got pregnant and had a very healthy baby in 2016. About a week before I found out I was pregnant with my daughter I had very extreme emotions. Not just depression (which I have) but some serious anxiety and a desire to put myself in a secure and healthy environment, which I was in, but this was a desire to care for my body. The night before I took my positive pregnancy test I, who was a heavy drinker at the time (I’m 9 months sober now. Heyooo!) took a chug of Whiskey and I was absolutely disgusted. The next morning I took a pregnancy test. I had absolutely no reason to believe I was pregnant. It was just a weird gut feeling, and sure enough it was positive.

I have had this exact feeling for the last two weeks. I didn’t put two and two together until I started bleeding so heavily. I know this sounds silly, but I am very active in keeping mindful and working on my mental health, and when these feelings arose I felt very uncomfortable, unmanageable, and I packed a bag and went to my parents to “get healthy.”

Could this have been a chemical pregnancy? Could I have taken the first pregnancy test too early to detect HCG and the last one too late to detect HCG?

It got a little better with time... but even in my last relationship, it just felt like something that I simply would never do.

In my current relationship... I knew from the get-go that my husband values having a family. He even broke up with his last girlfriend because she said she wouldn't ""have time"" to have kids (there was, of course, more to it than that, but it was a big catalyst). I came into the relationship knowing this (he and I have been friends for... 13 years now?), and I was, by then, somewhat open to the idea.

Fast forward to now... we've been sorta trying since December. I was even the one who said ""We should start now, because we're never going to have a better time.""

I have an anxiety disorder, as well as PTSD, Depression, and ADHD. It's an interesting mix. But, the hardest part for me right now is the fear: I'm terrified. I have moments right now where it really \*sinks in\* and for a brief moment, I feel excited... and then terrified. Terrified. And then it goes away, because I return to denial. It's easier there.

There are so many things about this process- mostly, about the medical system around the process -that I am scared of. I feel completely unprepared. I can't even say it out loud, ""I'm pregnant."" I've put myself in to get a Midwife, because it's very difficult to get one where I live, and the usual rhetoric is to get on it as SOON as you know. I would probably have done it yesterday if they were open. I'll find out soonish if I can get one. 

Err, so... any advice? Has anyone else struggled with this kind of fear early on?

"In light of the increasing COVID-19 cases, has anyone's provider recommended early induction/delivery ? I'm 37 weeks. Due for a repeat c-section April 3rd. I'm pretty concerned with how this is all going to play out.

I met my BF in March 1st week and we had unprotected sex several times then. He never came near or in me during that time. Still as a protective measure I took 2 contraceptive pills during that week. I got early periods during second week of March. But I haven't gotten my next periods yet.

We've been under lockdown since then due to COVID. Now my periods are getting delayed. I'm worried sick because of this. Last week, I was also diagnosed with a UTI and started taking medication for it.

What is the chance that my delayed periods are due to pregnancy? Or is it due to stress/UTI?

I know this may sound ridiculous but hear me out. 

So I have a cat that ran out and came back with a strange scab. I couldn't determine if it's an allergic reaction or an animal bite. A trip to the vet later in the week has been set. I must also note that his one year rabies vaccine is overdue by 2 months.

Anyways the other day he decided to grab my leg and bit me. He likes to do this sometimes playfully so it wasn't out of the ordinary. I examined the bite and it did break skin and bled a little.

This is where my fear kicks in. I am now worried that I might get rabies because he might have been bitten by an animal outside and then bit me. Will I get rabies? The cat isn't showing symptoms and is acting perfectly normal but I can't seem to shake it off.

I have ginger blood so I'm very pale as in lightest foundation at the store pale so everything shows up that much worst.

Idk if this will help, but me and my sister were born around a month early due to my mother having HELLPs syndrome. 

One morning I woke up sore, like I slept wrong or something. I went on about my day. I went to bed again, and woke up a little better, with not much  pain. 

Well, I went to volunteer and help set up an Easter Egg Hunt. I was doing fine, spreading eggs around, bending up and down to do so. Now, it wasn't like I was doing hard labor, I was just bending down and spreading eggs out on a flat surface for toddlers to find, not bad. 

Well, eventually the event started, so I was walking around, looking at a snake from the petting zoo, when my dad tried to scare me. You know when people poke you in the ribs and it just feels weird, and startles you? Well, it wasn't one of those times, because all of a sudden my back seized up and was in glorious amounts of pain. Like a lightning bolt smiting my back. Taking a step was like a knife stabbing it, it was awful. 

After an hour or so coping with the pain, we decided it was best to get home. 

We decided to go in and then it was decided that I should get an Xray, since it felt painful when they put their hands where it might have been a break. The doctors and my mother think it was all muscle, and the xrays came up with nothing.

I had to ride home on the bus from school 2 days after, which was really painful as every bump felt like my back was crunching in on itself. I kept myself in a position where my arms held myself up to act as a shock absorber or something. 

The pain lasted a couple more days, gradually getting better.

"I have 3 children. My first was 9 lbs, born vaginally with no complications. My 2nd was an ""emergency"" cesarean due to the fact that I had been in labor for 6 hours and baby was showing signs of distress. I didn't question anything just wanted my baby born healthy. With my 3rd child, I was coerced into having a follow up cesarean, after being extremely adamant about not wanting to have another surgery. After 8 months of being told I could have a VBAC I was informed that my baby was measuring more than 10 lbs and that their professional advice would be to go with a cesarean so to avoid baby getting stuck in the birth canal. Of course wanting my baby to be born healthy I trusted the doctors advice and proceeded with the 2nd surgery, only to find out baby was only 9 lbs. The same size as my first child who I had no issues birthing vaginally. Now I'm dealing with some serious health issues, chronic pain and a hell of lot of frustration, as a result of the trauma to my uterus. Issues I never had to deal with before the surgeries.

I had gone to the hospital 20+ times at 34 weeks. Mostly for real issues. Had actually been admitted for a few days a few times.


Well I had just left the hospital on a Friday and started not feeling right Saturday evening. Sunday morning a poor mother shared her story of not trusting her body and unfortunately losing her child. She was sharing awareness for other moms and I am beyond thankful for her.


She was having a lot of the same issues as me.


Didn't feel baby moving, bad headache, and just a bad feeling.


So I called my ob, told her I was coming in something didn't feel right I hadn't felt baby girl move in over 12 hours. Called my husband to leave work early and come get me because I was too lightheaded to even walk by then.


We get in, my blood pressure is through the roof, my protein is up, my uric acid is up, and they are having a really hard time finding baby. My ob stopped by and told me ""you're a ticking time bomb. I can't send you home"" so I stayed overnight. The next morning my favorite nurse who I knew a bit by then, came in super sad. Informed me she was really sorry but my numbers were rapidly going up. I was going to be induced. We started including at exactly 35 weeks.


I had gone from risky blood pressure to full blown pre E overnight. It took 3 days to get me to dilate. When I started pushing and got baby girls head out I had my ob scream at me to stop pushing. Turns out baby girl had wrapped her cord around her next a few times and that's why her heart beat was down, and she wasn't moving a lot. Thankfully after almost 4 weeks in the nicu she got to come home, and now we have a happy semi healthy 5 month old spit fire.


However if that post wouldn't have convinced me it was better to waste a doctors time and be wrong than not go in and be right, both my daughter and I would be dead. Mama's, listen to your body. Listen to your instincts. Even if you nothing outwardly is wrong if you KNOW something is up go in.

"My unplanned cesarean birth was not natural because we utilized medical procedures to have a safe delivery. I wanted and tried to have a ‘natural birth’ ... A VAGINAL birth, the way your body is designed to release the baby. We tried and tried and she would not come out. It was time to trust the medical professionals who said it was time to do a C-section. Yes, it is not the natural way to have a baby, fine. But every time you post a comment, title, or story and refer to vaginal birth as ‘natural birth’ ... it alludes that my cesarean delivery was an UNNATURAL birth. It’s just not very sensitive. And nothing about me doing anything possible to have my baby safely is unnatural. It’s completely natural to use everything available to you to protect your baby, even if it means getting your own body sliced and diced.

"A disclaimer: I’m not a lurker, I’m also on this journey (for the 4th time!) with y’all! 

On to my message:

I’ve been so thankful to have these groups to keep me entertained, celebrate, commiserate (GD!), and learn about new things! One thing that I keep seeing pop up is about moms not wanting to impose on the nurses during labor, feeling embarrassed about things that happen during labor/pp, or worrying about expressing their desires during the hospitalization. 

I’m here to speak for majority of L&D RNs when I say - WE LOVE OUR JOBS!! We know that with labor and childbirth comes strong emotions, family dynamics, throw up, blood, poop, sweat, and other fluids. And that’s okay! Cause we also know that as part of our job description, we get to be there when little babies come into the world and take their very first breath, when women get to witness just how amazing their own body is to have created a perfect little person, and see their own strength to have gone thru childbirth- whether vaginally or via major surgery. I mean- come on! does it get any better than that?!

We as women often have such complex relationships with our body images, for one reason or another. And to be present when a fellow woman has the opportunity to see that we are made for this... well that is just another perk of the job. 

I know that some of you may have seen us when we are not at our best and I’m sorry about that. We are just people too. We may have walked in the door and been rushed back to the OR to take over a crash c-section, had to support a family who lost their baby, you may be the third delivery of our shift, we may have not sat down for a proper meal for 12 hours, or shifts go by when we’ve literally started the day with a cup of coffee on the drive in and not had a sip of anything for the duration of the shift. So if you see us at that moment, we try not to show it but sometimes, it’s hard not to carry that weight from patient to patient. It doesn’t mean we don’t love our job, it just means we are flawed like everyone else. We love what we do!

So if you are worried about bothering us cause you are nauseous or throwing up, if you feel bad about pooping when you push, if you are nervous about holding it together on our account, I’m here to say: don’t! We have seen it all, cleaned it all, endured a lot, and yet we still *love* what we do! 

I hope this message finds anyone out there who needed to hear this. We are so excited to be a part of your labor and delivery experience!

"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/ici7ez/26f_recommended_for_termination_of_pregnancy_in_a/

First of all I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you not only to the physicians who responded but also to everyone who upvoted and comment-bumped me for visibility. Obviously the physician responses helped on the medical end, but the simple comment bumps helped so much emotionally. I'm in this country without family (except for my husband and toddler) and sometimes it honestly gets really lonely so having even the tiniest bit of online support meant the world to me. I even want to thank the user who posted anti-semitic comments because your comment specifically helped this hella Jewish woman connect with other Jewish women on this forum who offered hands-on support, validation, and rescoures. 

I had a meeting with the specialists in the termination committee today and they diagnosed the pregnancy with cystic hygroma in addition to other serious physical (nasal, respiratory, heart) malformations that would make the fetus 100% incompatible with life. They made it pretty dang clear that I could basically miscarry at any moment, which sounds about right to me as a layman given all this info. We asked about genetic testing/probability of this happening again and they said it's very unlikely, the occurrence of this situation is less than one percent overall. So I've decided to forgo any additional testing like CVS or amniocentesis as a chromosomal defect would just be another issue on the list and not a defining factor in my choice. 

So unless nature takes it course, I'm scheduled for an inpatient termination this coming Monday. I can't really find anything online about inpatient terminations, but they gave me the choice and explained that the outpatient procedure would be started with dilation by osmotic dilators and move quickly while the inpatient procedure would use slow, supervised dilation with less trauma over 48 hours. I'm not 100% sure if they meant physical trauma or emotional trauma, as they mentioned some people find it very uncomfortable and impeding (especially with childcare) to do the outpatient dilation and return to the hospital for the procedure.  I'd read about osmotic dilation earlier and it really freaked me out so I was super happy to have this previously unknown option offered. 

I'm feeling a lot more secure after hearing from everyone in this community, my doctor, and today's specialists. I never in a million years thought I'd be terminating a wanted pregnancy for any reason but I still have thousands and thousands of chances to have another baby just waiting in my ovaries so I'm going to focus on that and also on my toddler who is already my whole world. And I'm thankful in that I've experienced this and can hopefully help women who are in this situation in the future. 
Thanks everybody!

"I enjoyed reading motherly advice on here before I had my girl 8 months ago at 36 weeks/6lb. Here's what stuck with me, YMMV, every pregnancy/baby is different:


1. Hospital bag/Hospital:


 The hospital has everything baby needs, focus on your own comfort. Hormones made me hot and sweaty so feeling clean helped a lot.


Postpartum room essentials: 6' phone charger cable, robe, sleep mask, water bottle, bath sheet, flip flops, soft clothes/underwear (I'm a size 16 and the mesh underwear was uncomfortably small), facial wipes, dry shampoo, gatorade, nail clipper, razor, snacks, folder to put all the paperwork/copy of marriage certificate for the registrar

Edit: Lip balm! Epidural drugs make your lips super dry


The newborn going-home clothes I brought were too big for my 6lb late-term preemie baby, next time I'll pack a preemie outfit.


2. Home prep


I put a mattress protector on my bed around 30 weeks... Good thing since my water broke in my sleep, surprise!


Next time, I will clean and sterilize some bottles and pump parts in advance. You don't want to be reading pump instructions while your hungry baby cries because they're unable to latch onto your breast.


I will also have some freezer meals ready, it wasn't the end of the world, but it would have been nice.


3. Diapering/ Cleaning


I've cleaned a lot of baby messes by now, these work:  
- Dawn blue dish soap for fresh stool stains. 
- Oxy clean soak for yellowed hand-me-downs with oxidized drool stains. 
- Dreft stain remover to pre-treat spit up/milk stains before putting in hamper (I keep the spray bottle near the changing table)


We keep disposable blue underpads for diaper changing, it has mitigated the damage from many pee fountains. They're also great in the diaper bag and in the car, and are useful to contain poopsplosion-baby while you run a bath for them.


We cut a dedicated sponge for cleaning baby dishes and toys. Regular sponge is too big to fit most of them.


4. Random 


I avoid Velcro now, it's loud/startles my baby and gets stuck to things in the laundry.


I will remind myself baby doesn't need to be stimulated all day long.


I'll never have enough bibs and they will save countless outfits


Baby congestion was a big problem for us. It affected her feeding and sleep and we didn't know why at first! Spray saline and a nasal aspirator saved us.


In an emergency sometimes the floor is the safest place to put your baby. No baby has ever fallen off the floor.




5. Finally, these are things from our registry that we use/don't use:


Must (we use these every day multiple times a day): 

- Bouncy seat

- Nursing pillow (for feeding, napping, playing, climbing, protect while sitting on floor...)

- Sound machine (white noise, ocean waves...)  

- Ubbi diaper pail. 

- Dishwasher basket for bottle parts. 

- Bandana bibs. 


Nice to have:

- Wipes dispenser with weight (like Oxo Perfect Pull)
- Haakaa


Not used:

- Bottle brush (bottles go in dishwasher)  

- Too many fitted sheets (guess I was expecting night blowouts on the reg), really only need 2

- Baby monitor (small enough place that we're always within earshot)

Thank you for reading this novel. On mobile, holding a baby, and English is not my first language, sorry if something looks wrong. Good luck!

I have been sharing a room with one mother who had just given birth who also just happened to lose his 7 year old son because of a serious illness midway through pregnancy. She is being discharged today with her new baby but she was being monitored all the way through her stay because she was having panic attacks and anxiety. I overheard the Neonatal doctor telling her  ‘do not let your anxiety and panic attacks get in the way of enjoying your life and your new baby. You will love your new son just as much as you loved your lost son. You will be a great mother. Now go home and be a family.’

"The above pretty much summarizes it.

She's about 5'6 and 237lbs, African American, non smoker, currently on birth control and standard pain medication.

I've been with her for 2 years and we've only recently started seeing this. Just before Covid, she went to the hospital in February because of extremely heavy flow and cramps of lovecraftian proportions, and the doctors told her that she had posterior fibroids. She was prescribed medication to regulate her period and mitigate blood loss (regular birth control pills and something else, possibly pain meds, iirc), but it has since gotten worse. She has been bleeding HEAVY nonstop since the week before Father's day and I. Am. Worried.


She's now experiencing lightheadedness, shaking, and I'm afraid she's going to pass out due to the perfect storm of trying to work retail, dehydration from the heat, and blood loss. Today at work she noticed that her IUD strings were poking out, so I instructed her to leave work and come straight to me. We're headed to Planned Parenthood in the morning for the IUD, but is this caused by the posterior fibroids? Or is it a coincidence? What can we do to stop her from bleeding so much?

"36F, 5'5"", 145#, complaining of difficulty communicating with docs, been going on for a while, sometimes alcohol, no drugs.

I have a genetic mutation called GCK-MODY which is kind of like lifelong prediabetes. The nice thing about it is that it doesn't require treatment, it doesn't lead to the usual complications associated with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and my risk for developing other types of diabetes are the same as the general population. 

But damn, I wish I'd never been diagnosed with this. The problem is that every caregiver I encounter sees ""diabetes"" and thinks they know what that means. This mutation is rare enough that unfortunately, I am often a bit more informed than my doctors and nurses about the condition. I try to let them know I don't need counseling about nutrition and exercise, but I always seem to be put on the diabetes ""conveyor belt"" of treatment. This is extra unpleasant because I'm recovering from body image issues and disordered eating, so I can have irrational reactions to things said in these discussions. 

I understand this might sound like I'm ignoring some good advice, so I'll just put this out there that my A1c has been steady at 6.0 for the last six years, I have a healthy diet, and exercise 30-90 minutes six days a week. 

So it's infuriating for EVERY appointment, even with dentists and dermatologists and eye doctors, to start with a check in about how I'm managing my diabetes. I get my health care through a big organization with a central chart database, so every provider no matter what specialty sees ""diabetes"" before they even see my face. I had one obgyn say she would only manage my prenatal care if I agreed to an elective c-section, which is LUDICROUS even though pregnancy is the only time GCK-MODY might impact healthcare protocols.

When I try to explain about the condition, they might seem to listen to me, but then they'll conclude the conversation with a tip about limiting carbs and getting enough exercise, or a mention of what complications I can expect from poorly managed diabetes. It's depressing and irrelevant. 

So docs of Reddit, could you give me some magic words that will nudge medical professionals off the ""diabetes track"" and into care that's appropriate for me?

And by the way thank you so much for the hard work you do to keep people healthy. I really look up to medical professionals regardless of this complaint.",7.0,8.438369729588146,7.0,0.096,0.816,0.088,-0.2799,2426,1,1.0907851380524942,0.672

"On Thursday, my 15 month old’s babysitter noticed that she wasn’t making eye contact like normal. At home, I noticed the same thing. Normally, if I look at her and smile she smiles back. But it looked like she was looking right past me. Along with that, she was not tracking objects with her eyes.

I took her to the pediatrician on Friday who was concerned and wanted her to see an ophthalmologist right away. So we did that, she had a full eye exam with her eyes dilated and there was nothing wrong (like far sightedness or strabismus etc) with her eyes. The ophthalmologist was concerned too and called a neurologist who wanted us to go to the ER so we could be admitted into neurology over the weekend.

The ER did a lot of blood work, a spinal tap for fluid (I can’t remember the name- I’m sorry.) and the doctors there just generally said they were stumped.

We are on day 2 of being in the pediatric neurology unit. She’s having an EEG done for 24 hours and hopefully an MRI today. The neurologist says he’s fairly confident she isn’t having seizures but wants to cover everything.

I hope one or both of those things gives us an answer but in the mean time all I have to do is think. What could possibly have caused this loss of vision seemingly overnight? She responds to sounds but not objects. She’s had hundreds of lights (from nurses doctors etc) flashed right in her eyes and she does nothing like you’d expect. They shined a light in my eyes to show me how abnormal it was that she did nothing because I instinctively moved my eyes.

Also... no falls, no high fevers, no recent illness, her birth was normal, she’s developmentally normal.

Wife is late bloomer, she went from the shortest in the class to on the taller side.

Was 167 cm several years ago before we got married.

We had a couple of kids early 20s. She gained some weight during pregnancy.

Now she does exercises, a rowing machine and exercise bikes mostly.

Her height is now 171 cm.

Its not a measurement error. She measured 5'6"" or 167 cm several times, they have used a stadiometer.

Now she is 171.

&#x200B;

We also notice her height change as she is taller relative to me than she used to be. Memory and photos.

My doctors notes several ‘severe oddities’ for someone my age in my workup;

At 5 I was diagnosed with bilateral cataracts assumed congenital, no family history of this. 

At 14 I had a kidney stone

At 18 I had severe thinning of hair in the traditional horseshoe pattern. NOTE that while my paternal family does have MPB in the family it comes on usually late 30’s early 40’s. My mother’s side ALL the men including her father,  but one kept their hair their whole lives and the one has only a tiny amount of thinning. This was me at 20; https://imgur.com/a/sxyDcR9

I have ‘cherry angiomas’ on my scalp, something common in elderly but rare in young people even morseo on the scalp

I have macrocephaly meaning top 2% head size 

I take excellent care of my teeth and my dentist always compliments me by saying how clean they are but also says that they look like teeth they look that are as worn as they would expect in a 40 year old not early 20’s. He also said I have gum recession despite great dental care. 

Look I know all of these things can happen as isolated traits even the cataracts, I also know we all have oddities that are ‘rare’ in statistics somewhere but this seems like A-LOT of really off things with no family history. The genetics doc seemed to think because I’m otherwise healthy and active etc without issues there’s unlikely to be anything but my doctor didn’t seem happy with that. I guess any input is appreciated. I’m not expecting a diagnoses but this seems like a lot of coincidental occurrences doesn’t it?

EDIT: through insurance and work I get yearly blood CBC and metabolic tests. Always normal or close to it.

I have also seen neurology and dermatology as well as had an echo and Holter monitor (not due to issues just investigation) and all was normal. Every doc has pretty much said I show no signs of any health concerns. 

Only oddity in blood is low B12 

A BIG NOTE my cataracts were lamellar subtype, meaning that they are either caused by trauma or infection at birth or genetics however my type of cataracts are definitively different and easily told apart from the standard age related cataracts, meaning that them being related to an aging disorder is pretty much ruled out.

Multiple masses spanning over entire left leg
Noticed and sought treatment April 29th

My daughter has multiple masses within her left leg. The size/pressure has caused her to lose the ability to move her foot. She has seen quite a few specialists that determined she had a vascular/lymphatic malformation with multiple macrocystic hygromas. We were referred to The Hemangioma and Vascular Malformation Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and were seen within a month. 
Nine days after her initial appointment she was scheduled for surgery. Her masses were to be drained and then sclerotherapy was to be performed. 
Roughly 45 minutes after entering the OR my fiancé and I were called to a small room to discuss revised treatment options with her radiologist and newly appointed general surgeon. Her mass was unable to be drained as intended because the contents were thicker than intended and contained tissue(s). 
The general surgeon went on to perform her surgery - removing approximately 200mL of fluids, inserted a drain into her calf, and collected samples for pathology. 
During her time in post-anesthesia recovery: her mass had “refilled” and was nearly the same size/fullness as it was prior to surgery; albeit the mass was not as firm. 
The following day her capillary refill rate and temperature improved in her foot. No notable improvements in her foot/ankle movement. However her hemoglobin levels were low prior to surgery, during anesthesia recovery, and dropped further post-op. After being monitored and given IV fluids we were released to go home. We were discharged with orders to visit a local children’s hospital for a CBC tomorrow (05/23) to rule out the need for transfusion. 
Today, (05/22) we received a call from the pathologist. We were told that the mass is not what she was initially diagnosed with: it is not a hermangioma/hygroma/lymphatic or vascular malformation/cyst. We were told that they aren’t certain what the mass is. We were also informed that cancer has not been ruled out. 
She will be seen this week for a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan, hopefully. 

I will include pre/post op photos and measurements. At this point I am just seeking some sort of direction, what we can possibly expect, what we need to be asking doctors, and if there is anything that anyone can do that isn’t currently being done. Myself and my fiancé want to do all we can but we are scared and at a loss currently. 
TIA.

EDIT: forgot to include that upon discovery (7 weeks ago) the largest mass (calf) resembled an insect bite. It was roughly the size of a ping pong/golf ball. It is now easily soft ball sized.

"I just wanted to share my experience because I would have loved to hear from someone like me when I was still pregnant. In the last few years, I’ve become a plus sized girl. When I got pregnant, my doctor told me to try not to gain more than 20lbs max. I can honestly say I did my absolute best. I was eating healthy, tracking it, doing everything I could the first few months because I was terrified of something going wrong with this pregnancy. I gained no weight until the end of the second trimester, and that’s when the weight came in full force. 


I went from only 2lbs gain to 20lbs in no time flat. I stressed, I worried, I bought all the fresh veggies and fruits and threw away all the junk and the weight just kept piling on. I was eating only 1400 calories a day! I also became more and more hungry. After I reached 30lbs I sort of gave up trying, and I felt awful about it. I ate whatever I felt like. My Dr. was amazing and kept telling me to try and eat as healthy as I could but not to make myself crazy with the stress of it. By the end of my pregnancy, I gained 45lbs and felt like absolute ass for it. I cried so many nights thinking I was hurting my baby and myself and I would never get the weight off. 

Now sitting here 11 days postpartum, looking at my healthy little babe, I’m only 6lbs over my pre-pregnancy weight. We are breast feeding and I know that helps with weight loss, but I’m completely amazed how fast the weight came off. My kiddo was 7lbs 12oz when she was born and is eating very well, and I feel silly for all the self hate and stress I piled on myself during those last few months. 


I guess my advice is to listen to your Dr, eat as healthy as you can, but give yourself some credit and love, you’re growing another human. I wish I had spent some of the time just being amazed at what my body was doing rather than obsessing over my weight the entire time. Obviously, this will not be everyone’s experience, but be kind to yourself.",40.0,7.206538982814316,40.0,0.104,0.737,0.159,0.9697,1984,0,0.6540469152883466,4.16
"Female, 33yo, 5'5"" & 280lbs (150lbs two years ago).

On-going conditions/Medication:
- Bipolar (abilify, 2 years)
- Anxiety (lexapro, 3 years)
- Insomnia (trazodone, 3 years)
- GERD (pantiprazole, 3 months)
- Birth control (Apri, 1.5 years total but a 6 month break in the middle)

Issues: 
- BLEEDING: Two yearsish ago, I gained 100+ lbs in a year with no diet/exercise changes, and I had a heavy period for nearly 6 months straight. I went to a Planned Parenthood because I had no insurance then and they said its probably PCOS but did not do any testing so I have no idea how concrete that diagnosis is. I started birth control and the issue stopped for some time, but now I've been lightly bleeding (through my birth control) for about five weeks.
- VOMITING: Since March, I have been vomiting 3-4 days a week, at *least* 2-3x per day. This happens shortly after eating, no matter what I eat. I was started on Rx anti-acids which seemed to help briefly and are great for my heartburn but I'm still getting sick. Its increasing rapidly, I've been vomiting 2+ times daily for a week now. 
- DIARRHEA/LOOSE BMs: at least 3-4 days per week, 4+ BMs a day. It stops if I take imodium but then I'm constipated so i really hate relying on that so heavily. Its mostly shortly after eating, no matter what I eat,

I've had an upper endoscopy done but they said everything is normal. I was just told to lose weight. I've been trying to for months with a max 5lb change. I exercise several days per week for about thirty minutes per day. I eat a balanced, veggie heavy diet with low carbs and low fat. 

I don't know what to do anymore but I refuse to accept that being sick near constantly is ""normal""!

EDIT: I should mention, I have had bloodwork and fecal exams done and they ruled out Crohns/UC, bacterial infections, and parasitic infections. My thyroid is also normal.

EDIT 2: Added my low dose birth control to medications. My tests have also ruled out pregnancy and celiac. I have no abdominal pain.",20.0,8.195229396189507,20.0,0.119,0.827,0.053,-0.9716,2021,0,2.2448594604791547,2.38

"I have graduated at 39+6, baby boy was just 1 day short of the 40 weeks. My husband was joking that I was having all the conversations with my belly about showing up on time and not keep mommy waiting too long lol

It was a usual day for us, we went to Walmart around 3 PM to get more baby stuff ( masks and all with social distancing of course). I felt some cramping that made me sweat, I thought oh well it can’t be the baby yet. 

Once we got home around 8 Pm my cramps went from 3-4 to 8-9 pain wise. I started screaming scaring the living hell out of my partner. The hospital is right across the road for us so I get dressed and start waddling in the hospitals direction while breathing really hard and whimpering like crazy.

We made it to the hospital around 9 PM and got into maternity ward. The nurses said they would examine me and give me shot of Morphein and send me home due to COVID. 

In the examination room while I was waiting for the morphein pain killer, my contraction went from 8 to full 10. I was screaming like a mad woman and they finally showed up with the shot. The nurse checked my Cervix and it was 9 cm dilated, so they noped on the morpheine and transferred me to delivery room while I was screaming for epidural or anything. 

Around 11 PM I was hooked up to a laughing gas which made things a bit better and given an IV and fentanyl. The epidural was getting delayed and by the time anesthesiologist showed up my son’s head was already coming out. The doctor told me to push and after 3 pushes my baby boy came out screaming at 1 AM

I had a very minor tear and a few little stitches and was able to walk and take care of my sweetie right away :) 

Overall my labour took 5 hours with only 30 minutes of pushing and it’s my first child! Everyone out there kept telling me that my baby will be late and that it will be a super long excruciating labour as I’m a FTM. I’m here to tell you that it’s not true and it all between you and your baby :) 

We have a perfect baby boy who started sleeping through the night at 2.5 months and is a happy little guy no purple crying and any of those other things you get warned about :)

"Making a separate post of the comment I posted on the formula feeding thread - because I feel this needs to be said.

All parents - but certainly childbearing and feeding parents - that’s mostly mothers - should organize as a political class. Our systems are so totally family unfriendly, that it’s absolutely counterproductive engaging in trivial judgmental ‘wars’ with each other instead of focussing our energies towards effecting systemic changes.

Mothers judging other mothers is a super wasteful use of our attentional and emotional resources. Getting hurt over ‘judgment’, calling other parents ‘toxic’, those are the petty battles. Just do what’s right for us, judgment be damned. So what if someone calls us a Bad Mom? Let’s do our best act and have confidence in our judgment, they don’t know what battles we’re going through.

For example, it you are in the US — and most posters on here probably are - your system makes you feel like you truly have a free choice between BF and FF and lets you fight it out over what’s ‘best’ - while actually not providing you with the resources to actually spend time figuring it out and making the best decision for you. 6 weeks or 12 weeks or whatever shitty leave you get is not good enough to establish a great breastfeeding relationship, especially if you have problems in the beginning. You should have access to LCs, mental health therapists, healthcare, nutritionists... whatever it is that helps you become better parents. Pumping at work should be a worst case scenario, not a routine that people should be expected to get used to to be more productive 🙄 

The same goes for all those parenting ‘wars’ - how the babies sleep, how they are fed, clothed, diapered and weaned.

I wish we’d have higher standards, and use our energies to demand better systemic improvements to benefit all parents. That’s - a minimum of a year paid leave for mothers or split between parents. When we have the paid time and bandwidth to spend with our kids, we can then decide with greatest latitude what is ‘best’ for our particular circumstances. Without that, we’re just so constrained by our circumstances that nothing is really objectively the ‘best’ and we are all just wasting our energies.

"I am fully insured through United. With my first baby, I could order my breast pump at any time once I had a pregnancy on my medical record, but I was with a different insurance company. United’s policy is that you can’t order more than 30 days before your due date and that, frankly, is bulllllllshit. 

I’m having my baby earlier than my due date due to it being a large baby, so that already cuts down my time. Even with a scheduled c section at 39 weeks on my records, United has told me they’ll deny my claim if I order early.

I know this isn’t a concern for all moms because of the variety of breastfeeding decisions, but my first relied heavily on pumped breast milk early on because of latching issues. It’s giving me so much stress to think my pump won’t arrive in time. 

Also, I’m filled with rage when I think about how this policy would impact moms of multiples and preemies — two groups who are likely to need pumps early on for the benefit of themselves and their babies if they want to pump or breastfeed. (Again, no judgment on breastfeeding vs. formula!!)

"Our son is missing part of his 14th chromosome, and has a very rare syndrome called Kagami Ogata Syndrome... discovered in the last decade, only around 100 have been diagnosed in the world. I had polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid), which is a classic side-effect of this syndrome, and caused my extremely premature labor. He had an omphalocele (intestines and liver were out in his umbilical sac because his abdominal wall didn't close - repaired at 8 months and now has an adorable constructed belly button), small ribcage, and just due to prematurity we dealt with: necrotizing enterocolitis, pulmonary hypertension, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, massive inguinal hernias, retinopathy of prematurity (he had laser surgery), kidney fungus (he had nephrostomy tubes filtering amphotericin b for 3 months), he was intubated for 6 months before receiving a trach (which caused subglottic stenosis), tracheomalacia, g-tube at 8 months, bowel resection due to the NEC (at 8 months... most babies don't survive that without immediate surgical intervention), and now hypertension. At 6 months, we had to transfer him 3 hours from home to a level 4 NICU for a good number of those surgeries... we lived there in Ronald McDonald House for 5 months before transferring him back to our hometown PICU. I've seen him turn purple more times than I can count, I've seen him receive chest compressions, he's been bagged absolute countless number of times, I've done emergency trach changes, and yet here we are... he's more stable than ever. We've been home for two weeks, no emergencies, just a happy baby. He has a trach, ventilator, and g-tube, and we have 24/7 nursing at home (supposed to, anyway... nights are not always covered). Anyway, thought I'd brag on my cutie after a long and hard journey. He's a FIGHTER, and so are we.

"Hello,  while I’m currently not pregnant myself, I’ve seen A LOT of parents have worries (understandably) about preterm birth, survival or potential outcomes, so it feels right, being 22 now, to use my birth as a beacon of hope for parents in similar situations, as I see many survival stories, but none from adulthood/long term. 

I was born in 1998, at 24 weeks, weighing 1lb 5oz. When I was born, they thought I was dead. I had countless blood transfusions, bilateral grade 3 IVH (brain bleed), grade 3-4 are severe. Many times they tried to take me off of the ventilators so I could breathe, and I’d just end up crashing. My parents often walked in to them performing chest compressions. They told my parents that I’d be severely disabled, mentally retarded, unable to walk, talk, see or hear. They offered to take me off of life support. 

I’m here at 22 now, I have aspergers (which runs in my family) and ADD/anxiety (also genetic), and dyscalculia (maths dyslexia) That’s it. No movement issues at all, not even asthma. I’ve grown up around second hand smoke. Now, I know not every story is like mine, but the point is to never lose hope. In the eyes of the doctors, I shouldn’t be able to write any of this to you.

"1. Gestational age VS gestational weight? Which is better as far as prognosis.

A: Gestational age is better, but low weight makes it more challenging. She doesn’t expect him to gain much more weight but she doesn’t really know. She has seen babies as small as 1 pound survive, she’s been a NICU doctor for 26 years. 

2. What would be a good goal weight/age to get to for the best prognosis?

A: A pound or a little more would be better than under a pound. 


3. What can we expect as far as ventilation, feedings, oxygen support, time in NICU, etc..?

A: Baby will likely need ventilation support, feedings will start very small and he will get a few drops of breast milk, if the feedings aren’t working they will switch him to intravenous feedings. Time in NICU will depend on how he is growing and any issues that arise and how well his lungs develop.

Afterwards I went to cower on the couch, laying on my side to allow my backside to recover from that trauma. Little did I know...

About an hour later, 9:45, I returned to bathroom to get ready for bed. I opened the toilet lid to see what looked like some toilet paper that hadn’t gone down. I though, “no problem” and attempted to empty my bladder for the night (ha ha). When I went to flush however, it became clear that it was not just toilet paper - no, I had apparently butt-birthed a cement monster that absolutely refused to budge. 

I got out the plunger, to no avail. Our toilet has a weird bottom step so the plunger can’t make a seal. I tried to add hot water to the bowl - why? Desperate times, desperate measures? I kept trying to flush - the saving grace here was that the water was not overflowing. 

Eventually/slowly, all the TP went down, but the behemoth was still there, ignoring all my pleas for it to vacate the premises. As I continued to attempt the plunge and flush method, I imagined that it would just be our new pet and start pondering what we’d name it. 

I messaged my husband that I broke the toilet and we needed a new, bigger plunger and that I was moving permanently into the bathroom. He begged to help me but I refused - it’s not about the poop, or being embarrassed - I was just not about to be defeated by this thing. 

He advised me to get aggressive with the plunger, “like you’re stabbing a MF’er” you know, as you do. Which of course reminded me of the classic Reddit poop knife story... 

Husband had recently put an old, extra long shampoo pump into the trash (now I was grateful that I didn’t take it out and put it into the recycling). I grabbed that and started to use it to break up the lingerer, which took another 15 minutes and 6 more flushes to chip away at it enough for it to FINALLY go down the pipe. 

My husband again begged to help, I told him he could open the back door so I could immediately put the trash with the bastardized shampoo pump into the bin outside. And that he could sanitize the plunger and the entire bathroom in the morning. I finally emerged, triumphant, around 11pm (way past my bedtime).

After barely sleeping, haunted by my toilet nightmare, I have committed to reviewing my diet, eating more fiber and less mac and cheese and ice cream. And talking to my doctor about how much Colace I can safely take. And also buying a bigger plunger.",4.0,8.699414401134899,4.0,0.076,0.866,0.058,-0.7769,2809,3,1.310118945009481,0.304

— Now info possibly related to her problem she is totally obsessed with food and extremely impatient with it, so I feel like this is just caused from her frustration from impatiently awaiting the food. But this time she was eating herself, not me feeding her. She did it about three times during this meal and I finally managed to catch it on camera but she did it yesterday as well.

Should I be more concerned about these spasms?

EDIT: so I wanted to edit this with an update in case someone searches for something similar and comes across this post. So her doctor wanted to see her right away when I mentioned possible seizure (if you think your baby/toddler is having seizures you need to get them seen right away, Emergancy room in a good hospital and demand an EEG even!) luckily, once going to the doctor I had another longer and more detailed video than this video and the Dr. immediately told me she absolutely thinks this is just behavioral and that is because her eyes seem attentive and she doesn’t fall forward or cry and it is extremely short. she told me though that she has no issue with sending anything to a neurologist if something still seems off after today. Luckily she hasn’t done it again since the weekend. I feel extremely relieved now. Oh and she also said I can try and startle her while she does it and see if she reacts, because having a seizure, she wouldn’t be able to be startled or reactive to something quick like that. 

I’m so thankful for all the wonderful people who helped me on this post!",28.0,7.362817387310287,28.0,0.077,0.825,0.097,0.9554,1876,1,0.7937326048860942,2.156
"Hi NICU mommas and daddies!

I am officially joining your ranks as of Tuesday. 

Back story: I was due July 8th with our sweet baby Olivia Joy. Last Friday, at 32 and 2, I had some vaginal bleeding. I had started BP meds on 5/12. I had had an OB appointment the same Friday morning and everything had looked good. When I got to triage, they determined the bleeding was nothing. But my BPS were off the charts and they had found protein in the urine. (Ah yes, we know where this is going - hello pre-eclampsia!) They told me that they wanted to monitor me for 24 hours and give me steroid shots to develop her lungs further. The next day they diagnosed and said to get comfy at the hospital and we were going to shoot for 37 weeks.  Monday, I had a scan and they decided Olivia needed to come sooner rather than later. She was measuring 3 pounds and 9 oz and in the 3rd percentile for her gestation and there was cord restriction. I was absolutely terrified and angry feeling like this was all my fault.  They induced me Monday afternoon. 

Tuesday, I labored all day. I had two failed epidurals and between Olivia distressing and me writhing in searing pain - I called for the c-section. It wasn’t worth it anymore. They got my husband suited up and took me back for the spinal tap (lol spoiler alert- it failed too. My spine is the worst). That meant, they were going to knock me out, which meant hubs couldn’t be in the room and see his daughter born. I sobbed as they laid me down. The day, HELL, week had already sucked enough. 

But then, at 7:02 pm, at 32 weeks and 6 days, Olivia Joy was born at 3 pounds and 3 ounces, 17.5 inches long and seriously, just  perfect. 

Since I was on magnesium sulfate, I wasn’t able to see her that night which broke every part of my soul. But I got to see and hold her the next day. And then began the NICU mom journey. 

She impressively was born and could sustain on room air. The CPAP was off before they left the OR. She is the embodiment of the Shakespeare quote,” Though she be but little, she is fierce.” 

She has been doing really well. They’re upping her feeds, she’s taking a pacifier, she’s starting NNS. I feel like she is an absolute rockstar for barely being a 33 weeker. She fluctuated below birth weight a bit this week but as of today is 3 pounds and 3.9 ounces. 

Today, I was discharged and I guess in my introduction, I ask for guidance on how not to fall apart each time you leave the hospital. It’s so hard to leave her. I have no idea when she will get out and all I can focus on is how I don’t get to take her with me. 

Anyway TL:DR. I have a barely 33 weeker, she is a rockstar but I am an emotional hot mess who is struggling to leave her baby after being discharged today and facing all the unknowns. 

Here’s a picture of my cutie 💗

"Hi everyone. I gave birth to my sweet baby boy on July 18th, 2019. He just turned 1. His birthday had sent me spiraling down memory lane. 

To all of you parents who are sitting in a rocking chair next to an isolette right now, feeing like time isn’t even moving anymore: it’s gets better. I cannot begin to imagine what it is like being the parent of a preemie in today’s world, as it is so vastly different from what it was a year ago when I was in your position. I know there are days where you hate everything and days where it feels like a dream. I know there are days where you pray to whatever god will listen, whether you believe in them or not. I know that the emotional toil that it takes to gets through every day can be crushing, but there are better days ahead. The day when you buckle your sweet baby into their car seat and walk out of those doors for the last time. The day when they start taking full feeds for bottle or breast. The days where you can pick them up without waiting for touch time. Those days will come. I don’t want to tell you that a year from now it will all be a distant memory because that didn’t hold true for me, but the experiences you’re going through now with your baby or babies will change you. It’ll bring out a fire inside of you like you’ve never known, and the only ones who truly know that feeling is the army of NICU parents behind you, supporting you however we can. 

To all of you parents approaching the first birthday: whatever feelings you’re feeling are valid. I myself have been a mess this month, reliving the memory of my weeks in antepartum and my sons birth. I know he is home and safe, but the grief cycle is real is and we’re all working past that sense of loss that I know a lot of us feel. While this is your baby’s first birthday, it really is a time to take care of yourself. Do what you need to to get through the day. If you’re happy, be happy. If you’re sad, be sad.

I joined here when my son was born and have posted a bit, mostly lurked, since. I started a virtual support group on Facebook for fellow preemie parents trying to navigate parenting a preemie, because it is so different than parenting full term, healthy babies. 

I wanted to share a photo of my son, Alexander. From 2 lbs to 20 lbs. He is amazing. He has some delays and we’re working on meeting milestones, but he is happy. He knows how to shake his head no when I try to give him something he doesn’t like. He laughs and laughs in the mornings when I go to get him from his crib. He so intently watches the world around him. He was worth every single moment of everything I went through.

"Tonight I watched my husband tell my toddler ""Don't touch the buttons on the dishwasher!"" as he then scooped her into his arms and tickled her with his beard against her neck. And for a moment I felt a flashback to him holding her in the NICU, just 34+5, her little nasal feeding tube and various cords dangling everywhere, one FIFTH the size she is now. And I felt such immense gratitude. Gratitude that she's okay, and I'm okay, and we've got a chunky lil shorty who is sharp as a tack, babbling happily in English and Spanish, saying such clever things like ""La pelela es casa caca"" (the potty is poop house!)  Telling me that the very hungry caterpillar in her book  is ""grande y gorda como Mamá"" (big and fat like Mama) who happens to be pregnant with her sibling at the moment, a baby whom i like to joke is between 50 and 75 percent ""done on the inside"", depending on whether I deliver early again or full term this time. 

I know some situations are more complicated than others, and ours was a relatively short stay of just nine days in NICU, but the experience will stay with me for life. And I just want anyone else going through that unexpected journey at the moment to know that one day you'll have such a mundane moment that will bowl you over in such gratitude, and, in some ways, with enough time, you'll see that the weight was a gift.

"[Baby tax - 9 months out!](https://imgur.com/a/OFcU5wa)


So I had this little cutie back in February. I chose to be induced about a week before due date (gestational diabetes). Very slow dilating but strong contractions. And like with my first delivery, the epidural only numbed half my body. With my first, they simply replaced the epidural and it was fine after that. This time around, they apparently wanted to avoid having to replace it. So instead they injected other pain meds into my epidural. I'm pretty sure there were two different additional pain meds added and one was fentanyl. Still only numb on one side and feeling strong contractions, they then replaced the epidural almost immediately after pumping in all those extra pain meds. It helped the pain, but then I started to feel scary bad. My blood pressure was dropping super low so the nurse was pumping me with the fluids to bring it up. I had never felt so close to death. I felt like my body was shutting down; like I might just stop breathing at any moment. I was having ""the talk"" with myself mentally (you can't die, they need you! Stay awake!) It was terrifying. Slowly my blood pressure rose back up and other than shaking uncontrollably I was feeling better. Right before showtime the pain was back and although I was scared of side effects I agreed to more pain meds. It was fentanyl again, but this time I vomited almost immediately after. Then I had baby and felt everything! I screamed. I pooped. It was ugly and beautiful and I never felt more relief than I did holding him in my arms. I didn't get that experience with my first since he was 2 months premature and went straight to NICU. Anyway, just be careful with the pain meds. Don't suffer through the pain but don't let them overload you either. Best of luck to you all!",40.0,7.5287185986073,40.0,0.216,0.617,0.168,-0.9787,1811,0,1.285637759657163,8.64

"I delivered my son in August at 28 weeks. His original due date was Oct 28th. My delivery was entirely unexpected, I had had an easy and healthy pregnancy without a single sign that anything was wrong, until one day my boy just stopped moving. We went into L&D for an ultrasound and I was rushed into the OR, totally in shock and not understanding. 

So I made the mistake of revisiting my October BabyBumps group tonight and it was filled with people's positive birth stories with full-term or barely preemie babies, and it just filled me with so much sadness and I started sobbing. Every time I go to visit my son and have to see a proud happy mama being wheeled out of L&D with her nice healthy newborn, I cry. When I see pregnant women out in the grocery store...yep, that's right-- I cry.   

 I know it's no good to dwell on the could-have-beens but it's so hard not to. I can't help but think about how I'm ""supposed to be"" super pregnant right now, feeling my baby wiggle inside of me, looking for tips on getting him to drop...all that third trimester stuff. This was my first pregnancy and I was enjoying it, and it just ended 2/3 of the way through. I never even wore the majority of my maternity clothes. I never got to let my mom feel baby moving inside of me. My son is doing ok in the NICU and hopefully will be out shortly after his original due date. I love him so much and am so glad to have him....I just wish things had been different.",1.0,7.110311073520413,1.0,0.069,0.771,0.161,0.9855,1459,0,0.42854481088131174,0.069

Hello,

As the title states, wife is 1 week overdue. For some context, the baby was in breech a month ago, now our OBGYN said she can feel the head down, so she scheduled us for induction. The previous 2 weeks she conducted a membrane sweep.

&#x200B;

 We checked the hospital's reviews that we were scheduled to go to and they were awful. We called our OB about it and she said to go to our planned hospital through the ER saying ""the baby's activity had decreased"" and seeing if they would induce. We did that, and what they did discover that the baby was still in breech position and that we should have had a C section scheduled, the nurse told us they wouldn't induce because the baby's vitals were strong, and to call the OB the next day. I called the OB's emergency hotline and they didn't answer.

We need to get this baby out, it's a week and 2 days overdue and there are no signs of contractions. What should we do?

Edit: We told the OB we wanted a C section and we went to the hospital that she works at through the ER. At 8:06pm yesterday a healthy baby boy was delivered!!! Thank you all for your concern and advice.",30.0,6.682560333701452,30.0,0.032,0.922,0.047,0.5684,1238,1,0.6807062327164433,0.96

Hello, I had an extreme fight with my spouse this morning. I ended up screaming top of my lungs and hyperventilating. I knew I had to remove myself from the situation so I left. The duration of me freaking out was probably 20 minutes. 

To explain why the fight happened is a long story but my spouse has become verbally abusive during my pregnancy. I know I have to address it. 

Will this cause a miscarriage or harm my baby? I can feel baby moving here and there after I removed myself from the situation. I am really scared I harmed my baby.

My water broke and I started bleeding at 27 weeks. I’m in the hospital until I deliver.  The goal is to delay delivery until 34 weeks.

This was a huge shock and I’m totally lost. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.,6.0,5.921524974041369,6.0,0.112,0.686,0.202,0.8507,399,5,0.55442799861393,0.672
"Edit 3: Y'all have been incredible and I am so appreciative of all of you. To those who were hurt by my post - I am so sorry. It was never my intention. In a moment of weakness, I lashed out, and I am so sorry you were caught in the crossfire. To those who offered a different perspective - thank you for reminding me that no experience is the same, and that ""uneventful"" does not mean ""perfect."" To those who sat with me in the frustration and let me know it was okay to feel that way - thank you for being real.

Edit 2: thank you, everyone, for the responses. I have learned a lot and I am grateful for this supportive community. A couple things: 1. This was in no way meant to devalue or invalidate or diminish anyone's experience, and as one person pointed out, a short stay is not the same as having no problems. 2. There are always going to be insensitive people in the world who try to do exactly that. 3. We are incredibly blessed to have a great relationship to begin with - any instances of frustration at others' experiences is kept between ourselves, and we would never DREAM of calling someone out or anything. I just wanted to know that I was not the only person feeling that frustration. 4. I am so glad I joined this group - y'all are all incredibly special and wonderful people and I look forward to gaining more wisdom and perspective from people like you.

I know that the NICU experience is different for everyone, and I'm not here to gatekeep who can be considered a ""NICU parent"" because that's not my call.

But does anyone else get really frustrated by the ""[single-digit] days in the NICU and we're finally going home"" posts? Like, yes, I get it, you went to have your baby early and expected to go home with your baby shortly thereafter, and then were disappointed when you had to wait a week - and that's tough. But like...

My little girl was born 15 weeks early. She won't be coming home for another couple of MONTHS. And I live an hour and a half away. Part of me wants to yell ""GET A GRIP, you're going home after days, try weeks or months and then come talk to me.""

Anyone else with long-term NICU stays get that kind of frustration? Again, I'm not trying to downplay anyone's experience - that's not my place. Nor am I calling any one particular person out about this. I'm just tired, y'all.

Edit 1: thank you for all of the responses. I've read all your comments, but sleepy brain (thanks pumping schedule) says wait till later to respond. I'll at least say this - y'all are all incredible.",1.0,8.348625580626123,1.0,0.077,0.825,0.098,0.8356,2539,2,0.7856341189674523,0.077

"I had just unsubscribed from this subreddit, thinking I’d never be back here again. But here we are. I don’t feel scared, just devastated and confused.

My daughter’s birth was traumatic, and she suffered a brain injury due to lack of oxygen. She was cooled for 72 hours and stayed in the NICU for 14 days. I was in the ICU for the first 7 of those days recovering from severe sepsis (I had chorioamnionitis resulting from an appendectomy at 34 weeks). So my husband had to experience the worst of her NICU stay. By the time I was discharged and able to visit her, she was off oxygen and almost out of the warmer. 

Now it’s my turn to be the main NICU parent, and it is grueling. It started off with a big scare at the pediatrician on day 3 of his life. He was being seen due to having lost 10% of his body weight. They checked his glucose and it was extremely low, so we walked over to the nursery immediately and got him admitted. Right off the bat he needed oxygen and an IV and his body temp was 93. It was so scary to watch this all happening so quickly.

Now he’s on day 5 of his life and still feeding him is like a race against time, as his awake periods are so short and his stamina is almost nothing. The nurse said he’s acting like a much more premature baby, even though he was technically full term. 

They thought maybe he had an infection, but so far all the tests are coming back negative. I’m just so confused as to why my perfect boy isn’t able to wake up and have lots of big meals and get big and strong. I know it’s only day 5, and lots of babies take a week to start putting weight back on. But most babies don’t need this much help. 

So I’m worried he has a huge developmental delay. Our daughter is in special ed due to a delay, possibly caused by her birth injury. I always thought our son would be given an easier start and not have to go through therapies and services and would be able to just be “normal”. But now I don’t know.

"Hi all, long time lurker, first time poster. I feel like my 30 weeker is languishing in the NICU. We’re on Day 44. He’s been off the CPAP for about 2 weeks and is working on bottle/breast feeding. I’m in the NICU from roughly 8am to 7pm and breast feed twice a day (my supply is taking a hit from the prolonged stress I think. That and I can’t sleep- Im typing this at 4am). He still has an NG tube and has been progressing in his feeds, but it’s not linear at all- the first week he was POing 20 percent of his feeds, next week 40 percent, this week 50-70 percent. However this varies from day to day. I think the NG tube is probably contributing to his inability to finish his full feeds and events. He also just gets fatigued. He’s still having a lot of minor Brady’s and desats which he recovers from by himself, with some more “significant” ones thrown in. He did have a blood transfusion about two and a half weeks ago and his hemocrit is a little low but not at the point that they would transfuse again. 

Every day I am being told that he’s just “premature and needs to grow” and “every baby is different”. But I’m afraid I’m missing something and it’s causing his development to delay.

I’m at the end of my rope. I break down in tears multiple times a day. I’ve survived abuse, health crises, you name it, but this is breaking me. I’m crying as I type this. The NICU we’re at has good doctors and the nurses have been solid for the most part. I spend hours and hours reading about potential issues or ways to address them. The staff are responsive but I feel like they aren’t being proactive. And meanwhile time keeps rolling. It’s also not a great environment to be in day in and day out- it’s loud, overhead lights, I don’t have a lot of space to sit in, it’s incredibly hard to breastfeed. Yesterday I felt like I shouldn’t even go in for the next couple of days as maybe the nurses could get him to the point where he’s taking enough feeds by mouth so his NG tube could be pulled. But the idea of not seeing him for even a day makes me sick to my stomach. I need a “win” to keep going.

"I had my baby a couple months ago and I was wondering if it’s standard procedure to pull on a woman’s cervix while she’s in labor? I was induced at 7am that day, the gyno came in 3 different times throughout the day to check on me. The first 2 times she couldn’t find my cervix and said it was pushed so far back, the third time she found it and PULLED IT DOWN. I screamed so loud. It was the worst pain I’ve ever been in in my life. It was worst than contractions, worst than the actual delivery. I get terrible flashbacks of that day and I’m scared to have any more kids because of it. 

I was speaking to an old friend earlier who works in the healthcare field and she told me that the gyno was really wrong for doing that and I should look into my rights.

Is she right? I really don’t know anything when it comes to that and I don’t know if she’s just saying that or if I could actually build a case around that. Just looking for a second opinion I guess.

"Hi guys,

Like all of you, I'm trying to navigate these crazy quarantine times we're in with COVID-19.  Up until recently, we've been trying to social distance with our friends (who work in various public arenas, send their kids to day  care, etc.) by meeting outdoors and staying 6 feet apart. Now that it's getting cold, my husband and I are trying to figure out what's responsible as far as indoor gatherings go, which is up to 20x more risky as far as virus spread. 

Mostly our question is, do we ask everyone to wear a mask any time we see them indoors? It feels so awkward and also like it will lead to us not hanging out with people much this winter.

ANYWAY my question is, what are you doing with your closest friends? Masks at all times? No meetings at all? I need some guidance here. 

2 recent studies made us get a lot more serious about our distancing policies. The CDC showing COVID is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, miscarriage, and stillbirths. 

https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/covid-19-linked-to-preterm-deliveries-cdc-report-says/ar-BB197hDR?li=BBnb7Kz

Another study from JAMA done in London found that since covid, stillbirths have gone up 4x, even in babies with no birth defects. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768389

Not trying to scare anyone, just looking for a discussion on the recent studies and your thoughts moving forward into winter. Thanks! 🙂",12.0,6.711611899934832,12.0,0.058,0.822,0.12,0.9505,1440,5,0.4832930589117574,0.6960000000000001
"My oldest son had a lymphatic malformation that was diagnosed in utero at 20 weeks. He was eventually delivered through an EXIT (intubated during delivery ) procedure at 35 weeks. He was in the NICU for 87 days before he was discharged with a tracheostomy and a feeding tube. He has had more surgeries than I can count.  He is now a teenager. He is going well, but will eventually need more orthodontic surgery. 

We were expecting a healthy baby boy last week. He was delivered at 37 weeks via c-section due to uterine scaring from my previous c-sections. I was not given steroids ahead of time. Despite being full term he suffered from respiratory distress syndrome (wimpy  white boy).  His lung partially collapsed, and he was air lifted to a hospital with a level 3 NICU. He is improving, and we are hoping to have him home for Christmas.  

COVID has complicated everything. The hospital only allows one parent at a time. There are no private restrooms, and no eating in the patient room. I'm 4 days postpartum, and I'm pumping. I can't drive yet, and people are constantly mask-less in the family waiting room. Even staff pull down their masks to talk on a regular basis. Not only are we concerned for our newborn, but our older son is on an immunosuppressant. 

The docs are very optimistic. I'm just struggling a bit.",1.0,7.744207448007845,1.0,0.102,0.837,0.06,-0.9034,1331,0,1.6997167138810196,0.102
"My wife is 28+5 and we have been told our baby is in the 1st percentile, weighing in at around 800g, with no amniotic fluid as highlighted at the 28 weeks scan (scan on week 23 was fine).

We're scared now because blood flow is good so the consultants are entertaining possible genetic/chromosomal issues.

The challenge we have is running the risk of inducing early delivery (and everything that comes with that) by testing for chromosomal abnormalities via invasive methods. What do we do? It's such a difficult decision to make because if we found that the baby had serious conditions that would limit quality of life we would have a difficult decision to make. If we don't, we don't.

"I'm currently 21 weeks pregnant and the hospital/OBGYN I've been seeing has made it a ""rule"" now that all women are to be induced at 39 weeks. I don't know if this is COVID related or if it has more to do with the fact that the OB department is severely lacking staff at this hospital and they just want things to be scheduled out. 



I'm not sure how I feel about this though regardless of what their reasoning is, I'm not super gung-ho on ""everything has to be natural"" philosophy but I do feel like it's just unnecessary and that a baby will make their arrival when they're ready. Unless I had some medical issue where they had to induce or went a week or more past my due date, I get it. But to just say ""you have no choice over how you birth"" seems really...wrong. By the time I'm full term I'll have an 18 month old and I'd rather labor at home for as long as possible so we're not gone from her very long and I have no idea what their covid response will be to having her come after the baby arrives. 


The next closest hospital is an hour away and I haven't called them yet to see what their policies are but I definitely plan on it. I just don't like them being so far either...I don't know I guess this is sort of a rant but what would your thoughts be on this and induction in general?",26.0,7.011329692413618,26.0,0.064,0.889,0.047,-0.5281,1305,1,1.3614124654328865,1.6640000000000001
"My baby was born 9/22 at 39 weeks 1 day.  He had a low heart rate and a low body temperature at birth, so he was taken to the NICU to be put under the warmer and to be evaluated for cardiac issues.  I have a genetic cardiac condition, so it was upsetting but not surprising to discover that he has it too.  He was put on proper medication and his heart rate went up and his body temperature became stable as well.  

We were preparing for him so be discharged when his oxygen saturation started taking alarming dips.  They did a chest X-ray on him and discovered that he had fluid in his lungs.  He was put on oxygen and will now need to stay a few extra days to clear out his lungs and get weaned off of oxygen.

I’ve heard of TTN, but from what I understand, it presents itself almost immediately after birth.  The doctors don’t fully understand why his issue didn’t start until about 3 days after birth.  I’m so grateful that we were already in the right place for him to get treatment when they caught it and that he was not discharged too soon, but I can’t help but worry about him.  The doctors haven’t actually used the term TTN to describe his condition, so there may be something different going on.

"Hello everyone. This is my first time posting on this sub. I’m a first time mom (26F) who is 23 weeks pregnant with my first baby due in September! I’m really excited about the baby and my pregnancy but I don’t think my husband (32M) feels the same and I was hoping to get some advice/support. 



Ever since I’ve gotten pregnant, he seems to have lost interest in me / the baby. We haven’t done anything “date-like” for months and haven’t had any physical intimacy since February. He doesn’t make an effort to spend time with me or even talk to me despite my bringing it to his attention. I’ve asked him many times if we can hang out and spend time together and I just get excuses (I’m busy, I’m tired, after my test we will hang out etc.). What bugs me is that he spends hours talking to his mom and brother on the phone and he spends sooo much time watching YouTube videos or reading stuff online related to technology and his other hobbies. Despite this, he hasn’t done much research on baby-related things and has made minimal effort to emotionally support me during my pregnancy.  He’s felt the baby kick 3 times and I have to insist he comes and feels my belly and once he feels the baby move he goes away and does something else. He hasn’t made much effort to make sure I’m doing ok and am not lonely even though I specifically moved in with him so he wouldn’t miss pregnancy milestones and so I could have support during the stay at home directive. I lived alone near the University I attend prior to moving in with him so being able to spend time with another person during the stay at home directive was supposed to help me not be lonely and stir crazy.



He knows it’s a concern of mine because I keep bringing it up and I’ve cried a bunch of times over feeling lonely. I’m at a loss of what to do since bringing it up doesn’t help. With the stay at home order still in place in our state, I can’t see my friends. My family lives a flight away so I can’t see them either. I’ve been doing my best to keep in touch with people virtually but it’s not the same as spending time together in real life. 



Has anyone else gone through a similar situation? How did you deal with it / cope? Would you recommend I join some new mom groups on Facebook to find more support?

"Hello all,

Posted about 6 months ago that we found out about our little peanut's IUGR diagnosis at 24+6.

So, a quick rundown: wife went into full on preeclampsia 6 weeks later, BP peaked at 190/110 and she was admitted for the week prior to birth. Her condition reached critical mass and at the end of January, our little one made her grand entrance via emergency C-section, weighing in at only 1lb 14 oz.

Baby quickly established herself as top dog on the NICU, with everyone involved in her care remarking at how feisty and full of life she was, even at such a premature age.

We were absolutely thrilled to find out her growth restriction was ""asymmetric"" and that her brain and other vital organs were where they should be developmentally. In addition, none of the other abnormalities or deficiencies we had feared for based upon initial findings were present. Besides being tiny, she is perfectly healthy aside from a little reflux. We are immeasurably blessed.

After 83 grueling days, our little one came home. She's been home almost 3 months and is now over 10 lbs. She is still on the small side for her weight, but her development and milestones are in line with her age. She loves laughing, smiling, and playing with her toys. She has begun to find her voice and her stubborn personality continues to shine through. 😉

I haven't commented here much (only lurked) since that original post, but I'm thankful for all of the positivity and support here.

To the parents facing this now: you are strong and you are awesome, and so is your baby. Not everyone gets the unique privilege of being a NICU parent. This trial will be testing, but it will eventually end, and your baby WILL come home. I'm so proud to be a NICU dad, and the growth I experienced both personally and with my wife as a couple has been invaluable.

Stay strong. ✌",3.0,6.928303686886701,3.0,0.027,0.767,0.206,0.9969,1860,0,0.1310615989515072,0.081
"What growth curves did your pediatrician follow after you left the NICU? Our pediatrician was tracking our 26 weeker on a normal full term baby curve based on his adjusted age and he was doing fine. Then today she showed us a different curve, one that is specific to premature babies born at various completed gestational months and his percentiles have suddenly increased. Basically the difference between the two is that this one tracks him against other preterm male babies. Technically he should be on a curve that starts at -3 months (born 3 months before due date), but the one she had started at -2 months. Presumably this curve merges with the full term baby curve at some point?",40.0,5.888396896306888,40.0,0.0,0.958,0.042,0.4784,687,2,0.0,0.0
"Well, I arrived for my 2.45 consultant appointment; had my blood pressure taken; gave them some pee; and then sat down in the waiting room (which is FULL of women today). It's now roughly 3.45 and still waiting. 

The propaganda screen is on. 

Pick your poison, are you:

sleeping wrong?

feeding wrong?

eating wrong?

living wrong?

leaving your DIY too late?

The list is almost endless. Oh, and there's an advert about how two MEN decided that stretch marks were an unacceptable side effect of pregnancy, so they fixed it! Form an orderly queue to worship them, ladies, and to buy their expensive miracle band! And don't forget the day gel and night cream. As if it would work without those equally expensive additions!

I. Am. So. BORED!!!!!!!!!!!

Edit: I eventually found a nurse to ask & it turned out they had managed to skip my turn and put everyone else ahead of me. After being assured I was definitely next, I STILL ended up waiting till around 5pm to be seen. 

At that point, she berated me for coming in at all, instead of having a phone consultation. I tried to explain that I hadn't seen anyone since 12 weeks, so I wanted to see someone in person. Foolishly thought she might ask SOMETHING or ANYTHING about me or the baby/pregnancy so far. She did not. Asked me what kind of birth I wanted. I said preferably VBAC. She handed me a load of literature on elective c-sections and explained when the surgery would happen, if I chose to go that route.

Also! Got berated by TWO different people for not having my blue card?! I wasn't seen at 16 weeks, so I was never given a fucking blue card or polywallet!!! 

Came out totally deflated and desperately trying not to cry. And considering they found blood AND ketones in my pee sample, it seems fairly reasonable that I went down there in person?!

"My wife (F27) is 24 weeks pregnant with our second pregnancy (miscarriage at Christmas for unknown reasons). 

The 20 week scan revelled that the liver, stomach, bowel and some gut are sitting in her chest, I won’t go into detail of explaining what CDH is as I’m sure you’re aware and mobile device format is horrible.

They believe the hole is on the left side and have been unable to see the lungs as she’s always in an awkward position (little wriggler)

We decided to go ahead with the amniocentesis and the results came back normal on both. 

Everything is perfectly normal and healthy just that we can’t see the lungs yet and can’t accurately measure the waist due to the stomach being in the wrong place.

Our team has told us it is on the more severe side but still a 50/50 chance as there isn’t much telling until she arrives.

We are very upset but trying to remain calm and positive, my wife is the most amazing, brave, beautiful soul so I am seeking some extra advice from across the globe, in the U.K we have limited research and studies. 

Our options are ECMO if she manages to respond well to the respirator and her lungs work with taking in oxygen and breathing out CM until she is strong enough for surgery to bring the organs down and place a patch of the required.

We also have an alternative procedure with balloons in the lungs before pregnancy to help her to swallow and build up strength, but comes with risk of premature labour which is not ideal as she needs to remain there to give her the best chance. 

Another problem that comes with that is our specialist teams around the country aren’t trained in how to remove the balloons and sometimes they become matted(this is what we are told) as the procedure is done privately not NHS

If I have missed anything I will edit everything is very foggy atm but we have got this and so much support from the wonderful team at the hospital.

"13 almost 14 month female current weight 23lbs height 31inches. I realize not all of these details may be relevant but at this point I don't know. Does anyone have any idea? I have posted about this before and got an answer but I just need other opinions.


Pregnancy 

Smoked cigarettes and quit by the end of first trimester

Medications taken: buspirone,Zofran, occasional tylenol, and unisom for nausea 

19 weeks had stomach flu

20 weeks fell

23 weeks car accident

High blood pressure last month of pregnancy. Not pre-eclampsia 


Labor and Delivery 

Induced at 39 weeks 4 days with cytotec and pitocin (elective induction/ was not informed of dangers of induction and was told it was as safe as spontaneous labor) 

Fetal heart rate had numerous and drastic decelerations throughout labor and undetected during delivery

Scalp monitor was placed and found no heartbeat

No epidural and Unassisted delivery

Violet's health history 

Born 5lbs 14oz, 19.75 inches, head circumference 13 inches.

Good APGAR score (8 I think)

Lethargic after a couple hours, low sugar, low temp, high bilirubin 

Spent time under warmer, given formula

Released next day/ no NICU time

Dairy and soy sensitivity that she may have now outgrown

Torticollis diagnosis at 7 weeks that was resolved with physical therapy 

Plagiocephaly that we got a helmet for but also mostly resolved with little to almost no helmet use

Frequent choking starting second night home in sleep. Was told by pediatrician it is normal and to keep a bulb aspirator next to her in case of choking

Choking worsens with feeding and we think it is because of a fast and forceful let down

Before 2 months has a few projectile vomiting episodes and frequent spit up

At about 3  months we are referred to a gastroenterologist who orders a swallow study

Swallow study shows no aspiration and that she has reflux but she still has very frequent choking with wet breath sounds (swallow study took less than 2 minutes and the radiologist complained about having to be there)

We started her on famotidine which seemed to help at first but quickly stopped helping. We upped the dose as directed but saw little improvement 

Starting at 6 months she has seizure like movements that we recorded and brought to pediatrician.

Referred to neurologist 

Did 48 hour EEG that showed no seizure activity

We got no official diagnosis but they guessed sandifer syndrome 

Eventually stopped these movements 

Since she was still frequently choking during and after eating, drinking, and during her sleep her gastroenterologist suggested an EGD and PH probe

Everything from these came back completely normal (which means no reflux)

We have now been referred to pulmonary doctor. Not sure why.

Current symptoms 

Chokes on most liquids but not as much while nursing

Chokes on a lot of foods

Wakes from sleep choking and gasping after making loud gulping sounds. Like she is trying to swallow but cannot 

Chokes at random times while awake and not eating or drinking 

When drinking from a bottle (which isn't often bow as she is 13 months) she audibly breathes loudly and takes frequent breaks to catch her breath

Snores sometimes 

Edit: Are there specific questions I should be asking or test I should request? Should I take her to a different kind of doctor and if so what? (ENT is already on our radar) Besides this she is right where she should be developmentally.

Edit again: she also has hiccups constantly",5.0,9.770264996878083,5.0,0.127,0.798,0.075,-0.9865,3560,3,1.6931075856552462,0.635

It's a long and not so pleasant story but we re both recovering well now. 

Labour started with irregular contractions on Monday the 2nd of November and I rang the birth centre to be told to wait until they were more regular, eventually went in and I was struggling with the pain to be told I was only 1cm. They checked my blood pressure and it was a bit high but got it down so was allowed to go home.

Got to 4.30 am on Wednesday and my front waters had gone so off we went to the birth centre and I wasn't much further along but my blood pressure was too high, so I had 3 hours on the maternity ward alone to monitor me and baby before my husband was allowed to visit. 
The plan was then I d get induced by pessary  if I got to 24 hours without much progression. Problem was the delivery suite was dangerously busy so those 24 hours came and went with no pessary and all this time I was on and off the monitors so couldn't leave my bed much.
I eventually insisted on being checked in the early hours of Friday morning to be told I was 3cm and wouldn't get a pessary after all and was on the top of the list to go to delivery suite, it got to 4pm and finally got to go to delivery suite.
The midwife then broke my hind waters which still hadn't gone but I hadn't progressed much from that so they gave me an hour and then I got put on the drip which meant staying on the bed got monitoring.

Unfortunately his breathing wasn't great and turns out he had sepsis so he got taken to nicu quickly after a quick bottle whilst I got stiched up. After antibiotics and a short stint with an NG tube, you would never know what happened and he came to the ward with me after 3 nights. 
And then I ended up with sepsis myself so had to be isolated for a few hours whilst they rushed my covid test to be sure it wasn't that and also have an iron deficiency so have two infusions for that on top of the strong antibiotics.

"EDIT - From responses it seems that my issues are localised to my own county. I don't want to alarm anyone with this rant ❤️

I'm so sorry, this is way more of a rant than I wanted but jesus I needed to get it off my chest after my appointment this morning. 

My midwife, bless her, was apologetic and understanding, but couldn't offer any advice and just kept saying 'I know, it's terrible. I've got so many other ladies in the same position'.

So they're no longer doing anything with regards to 'big babies'. Whether that's a local trust thing or nationwide, I don't know. But if you have GD and your baby is soaring up the percentiles? Good luck in delivering that huge baby at full term. Narrow hips or a history of struggling to deliver a previously large child? Yeah. You'll just have to have a c-section, you won't be given an option to be induced early for a chance of a vaginal birth.

In my case.. High risk because of a major arterial bleed? An artery that has been reccomended shouldnt be under the pressure of birthing a child larger than 8lbs? WHELP. Guess we'll just have to test the waters and hope it doesn't burst during childbirth! Or I'll have a c-section. That's already very high risk because of major abdominal surgery performed in order to fix aforementioned arterial bleed. Highly advised against by multiple obgyn and surgical teams. 

Guys I am PISSED. My obstetrics team isn't getting back to me until the 28th of January.. Bang on 37 weeks. I have no birth plan, no guidance, no reassurances that they even know how to approach my birth considering the very strict rules they were given by my surgical team for my first pregnancy.


As a side note, she asked me how my physio was going. This was the first point I burst into tears because I have severe SPD and I had one appointment 24 weeks in and was diagnosed so late they couldn't do anything to improve the pain - just slow the rate it worsens. Well, my follow up appointment was cancelled and I was offered phonecalls. Haven't had a single one since. 

Oh, and they've all but shut down all the post natal midwife services because they don't have the staff. So those checkups you get in the days after you give birth? Noooope.

She spent 70 days in the nicu, all the while I was listening to alarms conserned about her breathing. Finally got her home two weeks ago. I'm obsessed with her breathing and always think she's going to stop. I have had a repeating nightmare that prevents me from sleeping. Basically the dream is that she is in the bed with me and I lose her in the blankets and she suffocates. I have woken up screaming. (FYI she sleeps in the crib or bassinet never in our bed). I'm wondering if this could be something serious like ptsd or ppd. Should I see a Healthcare professional? Any advice is welcome. Thanks.",12.0,6.816877513872402,12.0,0.096,0.805,0.099,0.3918,891,1,0.9695990304009696,1.1520000000000001
"I had my daughter at 26 weeks due to complications from severe preeclampsia. She was IUGR and spent 137 days in the NICU. I was told by all the docs that I should wait to get pregnant again until my daughter was 18 months. They said to lose the weight. They said to get my BP down. I did ALL those things. 

Two weeks ago I found out I was pregnant. I had my first appt today and was told that I am not a good candidate for a VBAC because of the J incision that was made with my daughter....I am so completely, utterly devastated . I cannot describe how upset I am. It took everything in me to not fall out in the doctor's office. 

I feel like I have failed as a woman and a mother. I am ashamed that my body could not figure out how to work properly. I feel like I have failed my daughter by not being able to give birth to her vaginally or at full term. All I wanted was to be able to do it right...to redeem myself...and I was told no. I am so heartbroken.

I know ultimately that it is because they want me and my unborn baby to be safe...I know I am being 100% selfish. I am even thinking about going against my best interest and just asking them to 'let me try'. 

Have any of you experienced something like this? What are your stories? Please...I need some advice...and badly.",2.0,7.693276420495757,2.0,0.118,0.819,0.063,-0.959,1292,2,1.8727186160926836,0.236
"EDIT - From responses it seems that my issues are localised to my own county. I don't want to alarm anyone with this rant ❤️

I'm so sorry, this is way more of a rant than I wanted but jesus I needed to get it off my chest after my appointment this morning. 

My midwife, bless her, was apologetic and understanding, but couldn't offer any advice and just kept saying 'I know, it's terrible. I've got so many other ladies in the same position'.

So they're no longer doing anything with regards to 'big babies'. Whether that's a local trust thing or nationwide, I don't know. But if you have GD and your baby is soaring up the percentiles? Good luck in delivering that huge baby at full term. Narrow hips or a history of struggling to deliver a previously large child? Yeah. You'll just have to have a c-section, you won't be given an option to be induced early for a chance of a vaginal birth.

In my case.. High risk because of a major arterial bleed? An artery that has been reccomended shouldnt be under the pressure of birthing a child larger than 8lbs? WHELP. Guess we'll just have to test the waters and hope it doesn't burst during childbirth! Or I'll have a c-section. That's already very high risk because of major abdominal surgery performed in order to fix aforementioned arterial bleed. Highly advised against by multiple obgyn and surgical teams. 

Guys I am PISSED. My obstetrics team isn't getting back to me until the 28th of January.. Bang on 37 weeks. I have no birth plan, no guidance, no reassurances that they even know how to approach my birth considering the very strict rules they were given by my surgical team for my first pregnancy.


As a side note, she asked me how my physio was going. This was the first point I burst into tears because I have severe SPD and I had one appointment 24 weeks in and was diagnosed so late they couldn't do anything to improve the pain - just slow the rate it worsens. Well, my follow up appointment was cancelled and I was offered phonecalls. Haven't had a single one since. 

Oh, and they've all but shut down all the post natal midwife services because they don't have the staff. So those checkups you get in the days after you give birth? Noooope.

I just want to curl up and fucking SOB.",40.0,7.643636653132633,40.0,0.13,0.787,0.083,-0.9722,2270,5,1.5660763763402,5.2
"Reading some peoples birth stories where it didn't quite go to plan helped me when I was pregnant so I thought I d share mine a little late, it's still a bit traumatic for me but maybe this will help other mums
It's a long and not so pleasant story but we re both recovering well now. 

Labour started with irregular contractions on Monday the 2nd of November and I rang the birth centre to be told to wait until they were more regular, eventually went in and I was struggling with the pain to be told I was only 1cm. They checked my blood pressure and it was a bit high but got it down so was allowed to go home.

Got to 4.30 am on Wednesday and my front waters had gone so off we went to the birth centre and I wasn't much further along but my blood pressure was too high, so I had 3 hours on the maternity ward alone to monitor me and baby before my husband was allowed to visit. 
The plan was then I d get induced by pessary  if I got to 24 hours without much progression. Problem was the delivery suite was dangerously busy so those 24 hours came and went with no pessary and all this time I was on and off the monitors so couldn't leave my bed much.
I eventually insisted on being checked in the early hours of Friday morning to be told I was 3cm and wouldn't get a pessary after all and was on the top of the list to go to delivery suite, it got to 4pm and finally got to go to delivery suite.
The midwife then broke my hind waters which still hadn't gone but I hadn't progressed much from that so they gave me an hour and then I got put on the drip which meant staying on the bed got monitoring.
 I then had gas and air and dont remember much of the next 6 hours until there were 3 midwifes and my husband coaching me to push, 75 minutes later after a tear and an episeotomy baby Jack was born at 11:05pm and was 9lb 15oz. 

Unfortunately his breathing wasn't great and turns out he had sepsis so he got taken to nicu quickly after a quick bottle whilst I got stiched up. After antibiotics and a short stint with an NG tube, you would never know what happened and he came to the ward with me after 3 nights. 
And then I ended up with sepsis myself so had to be isolated for a few hours whilst they rushed my covid test to be sure it wasn't that and also have an iron deficiency so have two infusions for that on top of the strong antibiotics.

It wasnt the experience we wanted at all and it was clear the staff were very overworked so a few things didn't go as they should but after some time processing it I m grateful that we re both alive and for the midwifes talking me down when I was in tears alone threatening to leave the hospital.",11.0,8.770210187749964,11.0,0.093,0.847,0.059,-0.9683,2662,0,1.57600406710727,1.023
"Well, I arrived for my 2.45 consultant appointment; had my blood pressure taken; gave them some pee; and then sat down in the waiting room (which is FULL of women today). It's now roughly 3.45 and still waiting. 

The propaganda screen is on. 

Pick your poison, are you:

sleeping wrong?

feeding wrong?

eating wrong?

living wrong?

leaving your DIY too late?

The list is almost endless. Oh, and there's an advert about how two MEN decided that stretch marks were an unacceptable side effect of pregnancy, so they fixed it! Form an orderly queue to worship them, ladies, and to buy their expensive miracle band! And don't forget the day gel and night cream. As if it would work without those equally expensive additions!

I. Am. So. BORED!!!!!!!!!!!

Edit: I eventually found a nurse to ask & it turned out they had managed to skip my turn and put everyone else ahead of me. After being assured I was definitely next, I STILL ended up waiting till around 5pm to be seen. 

At that point, she berated me for coming in at all, instead of having a phone consultation. I tried to explain that I hadn't seen anyone since 12 weeks, so I wanted to see someone in person. Foolishly thought she might ask SOMETHING or ANYTHING about me or the baby/pregnancy so far. She did not. Asked me what kind of birth I wanted. I said preferably VBAC. She handed me a load of literature on elective c-sections and explained when the surgery would happen, if I chose to go that route.

Also! Got berated by TWO different people for not having my blue card?! I wasn't seen at 16 weeks, so I was never given a fucking blue card or polywallet!!! 

Came out totally deflated and desperately trying not to cry. And considering they found blood AND ketones in my pee sample, it seems fairly reasonable that I went down there in person?!

Hey..I’m 22F, 110 lbs, 5 ft 2, i take the mini pill and 150 mg of lamotrigine daily (bipolar disorder). I’d really like to know what could be wrong with me? I have been bleeding for a month straight now. The bleeding started as lighter than usual, it was pinkish, then it turned bright red, then brown, then back to bright red, brown again, and now it’s brighter red again. It’s been 31 days that this has been going on. I saw a doctor through my university a couple weeks ago and they tested me for STDs, those tests were negative. Took a home pregnancy test and also got tested during that appointment, both negative. She told me to wait it out and said she thinks it’s probably not anything serious. She told me to contact her in early January if I’m still bleeding and she might have to refer me to a specialist. I decided to set up an appointment with a gynecologist on my own, but there were no appointments until the second week of January. I don’t have big clots or anything, but the bleeding just doesn’t seem to be getting lighter, sometimes it feels like it’s getting slightly heavier (compared to my regular period the flow seems light-regular, it’s not the amount of blood that’s scaring me, it’s how long it’s been going on). What could be wrong with me?

I’m not having any extreme pains. Maybe light-mild cramping every now and then, but it isn’t constant. Had a migraine the other day which I sometimes get before the start of my period. This all started around the time I was supposed to get my period, and according to my period tracking app..right now is around the time I’d be getting my period again. But there was no break in the bleeding in between. 

I take the mini pill!!! Progesterone only! I started this pill THREE years ago and have been taking it daily ever since.

"My 28-weeker is 70 days old and had made great progress towards discharge. On Monday they discovered blood in his stool and since then he’s been moved back to intensive care, taken off feeds and has an IV and incubator again. We don’t know whether it’s a food allergy or NEC (an infection); the last x ray showed inconclusive results and wasn’t an improvement over the last one, so he’s on antibiotics while they continue to evaluate.

I’m so terrified. I already felt re-traumatized walking back into the intensive care pod and seeing my baby back in a box with a million tubes and wires. When I see NEC mentioned in preemie/NICU communities it’s always so scary and serious. The doctors say they really have no way of knowing how any of this will progress or turn out. They say it’s reassuring that he’s large and has had good vitals and bloodwork results, but that isn’t a guarantee that things won’t get worse.

In late February/early March my entire family got really sick.
Nasty cough, fever, fatigue. My eldest child needed to go to urgent care because he had hallucinations from low oxygen, he tested negative for the flu. Every time I took a breath it felt like it was restricted. Every time I blew my nose there was a small tinge of blood. I was exhausted just walking room to room. I don't have insurance and tend to ignore medical issues as it is, I wasn't near death so I didn't seek medical help, just waited for it to pass, after a few weeks it did.
Also around this time all the skin peeled off the bottom of our toes. And my hair began falling out in handfuls. 

Now it's 6 months later and within these 6 months life has been stressful as all hell what with lockdowns and lost jobs and everything else going on. So I've been ignoring the things I've been experiencing and attributing them to the stress.

Over these 6 months I have still had bouts of extreme fatigue. My hair has not stopped falling out, every time I comb it handfuls come out. I have blatantly obvious bald spots at these point and I get sharp pains in my chest. I began to find it hard to think and remember things, and stumble over my words a lot when talking.

I have recently read that these are symptoms common in some people who have had Covid and I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do about them.
I recently began taking collagen to hopefully help with the hair loss. But will it even help if its post covid symptoms?

I should have health insurance in the next month or so, is this even worth bringing up to a doctor.

"Hi, I’m a micropreemie survivor from 1998. I want to give parents some kinda image of a potential future, some hint of hope, for their children. I see many posts about survivors of preterm birth, but nothing about adults, so it occurred to me that in this awful year, I could do something good.

My husband (36) is actually going to be made redundant next year, likely around our due date. We've known since last December so this hasn't come as a surprise. He doesn't enjoy his job at all and isn't career minded. 

We've decided that I'll be taking the minimum maternity I can (it's currently 9 weeks at full pay) using annual leave to top up a little and create a phased return. My husband will be staying at home from birth/redundancy (whichever comes first) with an expectation he won't work for around a year. I'm also incredibly lucky in that I work for a very flexible company and will be working from home the majority of the time next year. 

Financially this protects us as I will have full pay maternity for the time off and then return to work full time. My partners redundancy is generous and will be enough to cover some debts and provide a monthly top-up to my wage for about a year. He will likely start to look for new roles around the 10 month mark and may return to work part time in the first instance. 

My partner is really excited to be a stay at home dad and it seems to be a great option for him. I think he also needs some emotional distance from work so he can figure out what he wants to do next. I'm under no illusion that this will be hard for myself to not fulfil that role but I'm really comfortable and happy with how our little family is shaping up and how we'll work together in a new way to manage. 

I have been feeling quite alone in this as I don't know any couple who've done something similar with the mum returning to work, but I know there's plenty out there. My company have said they've only had 1 other request for shared maternity in 4 years. 

Was just looking to see if there was anyone in this sub in a similar position and what your expectations are/any advice for planning etc?",16.0,7.417145079516062,16.0,0.03,0.884,0.086,0.97,2045,1,0.3487966515521451,0.48
"Before the lockdown, I was doing really well with the diet as in eating decent home cooked meals, smoothies in the mornings, fruit serving throughout the day, occasional indulgences at office birthdays or whatever, pizza on the weekend and very limited unhealthy snacks at home which was the norm. Come social isolation, it has been super hard. During our weekly grocery orders, we order as much fruit as possible but ensuring not to over order so that it doesn't go bad and we don't want to stockpile and empty out grocery shelves. Also, grocery stores are unable to fulfil everything we order so for instance, they ran out of yoghurt last time or roasted almonds.

This has led to me just grabbing whatever is sitting next to me when I get hungry. My husband has been buying more junk food (and I can't stop him either as we are all trying to cope with this situation as best as possible). Normally I have a LOT of self control but now I will grab three oreo cookies when I am hungry just because I don't have healthy snacks handy (there is a health food store seconds away from my house but I rather not to step foot inside any store either). That in and of itself wont be as bad if I wasn't reaching for a Twix bar two hours later and then Ruffles all dressed two hours after that.

I have tried making quinoa salad, or avacado toast but sometimes you just run out and not sure what to do during these crazy hunger pangs. Last week has been espesially rough since my work had a bunch of lay offs and a bunch of coworkers I was close with were let go so my eating has been has been all over the place.

My dinners are still normal, we will have usual stuff like meat, pasta, rice, beans etc. with a green salad and for breakfast I will have a smoothie. It is just the in-between that is driving me crazy and making me feel I am not doing the best for the kid. It sucks because I am not some health nut but I was confident about my diet before this the lock down but now I am not so sure.

Overall it is really confusing if this is because of the pandemic or regular pregnancy behavior? Also an  FTM here.

EDIT: I do work out atleast 30 minutes every day

TLDR; Coronavirus has thrown my eating habits out of the window. Being an FTM, I am not sure if it is the pandemic or pregnancy?

"Hi all,

A few weeks ago I posted about having some prenatal anxiety and depression and got some really wonderful and supportive responses, so thank you all for that! I've brought it up to my midwife and she gave me a prescription for Zoloft and referred me to a perinatal/women's mental health specialist which I'm looking forward to.

My question to you is this-- have any of you started taking an antidepressant during pregnancy/shortly before delivery, and what was your experience like? I'm just a few weeks away from my due date (though I suspect I'll deliver sooner than that-- baby is measuring big and my first was 2 weeks early) so my midwife suggested I start taking the Zoloft now so that by the time I deliver it will be fully in my system and help me pp. What's giving me pause is that my midwife said that whenever a mom is taking an antidepressant during pregnancy that a pediatrician is always invited to the delivery because sometimes baby doesn't ""perform"" the way they should fresh out of the womb. Meaning taking a little longer to start breathing/crying, lower APGAR score, etc. Has anyone had any experience with this?

Thank you!",12.0,6.587718648127943,12.0,0.044,0.853,0.103,0.9212,1159,2,0.427142995825648,0.528

"I've had severe anxiety and depression for well over a decade now. I used to have frequent panic attacks, bad enough that sometimes they would trigger seizures, but thankfully those have slacked off a bit. My depression, however.. here lately it seems like I have more bad days than good. Yeah, I'm excited for my baby. But I'm having such a hard time being excited about much else when I constantly feel like absolute shit. 

My anxiety is bad too, but not bad enough for full-blown panic attacks. At least not like, regularly. I had a panic attack in Walmart about a week ago and it hit me so suddenly that my boyfriend had to help me out of the store and into the car. I'm so scared that something is going to happen to this baby, that I'm scared to do anything. I go to work (when I'm actually feeling up to it, I spend most of my time hovering over a toilet bowl so my boss has been really lenient with my schedule) but even when I'm at work I barely do anything except ring people up because sometimes I'm flat out afraid to move. 

I had a miscarriage two years ago and it was so traumatizing.. I'd taken a test that turned out positive and then the next day I started bleeding... The hospital I went to made me sit there for 6 hours before the doc came in, said ""you're having a spontaneous abortion, here's a pamphlet of some FAQs and here's your discharge papers."" No sense of care or compassion, just cold articulation that left me numb until I got home and actually passed my baby... And then my world just fell apart. 

With this pregnancy... I'm terrified that the same thing will happen. I've had two doctors appointments so far, and we got to hear the heartbeat at the second one and that made me feel a little better, but I'm still just fucking terrified of being pregnant. Babies I can handle. I've babysat dozens of kids of all ages, from birth to 12 years old. I know how to take care of babies.. but I don't know how to be pregnant. I don't know how to convince myself that it's okay to be pregnant again. My anxiety keeps telling me that something is going to go horribly wrong again, and my depression takes that thought and runs wild with it. I'm having suicidal ideations. No, I'm not a danger to myself. I would never hurt myself as long as my baby is okay.. but if something were to happen to my baby, I honestly don't know if I would make it through that shit again. I barely survived the first time.. the only thing that saved me was my best friend refusing to leave my side for the first two weeks. He slept in my bedroom floor, made sure I ate, and generally just took care of me while I was too heartbroken to take care of myself. I know I have a support system should anything like that happen again, but.. how the hell do I stop worrying about something that may end up not even happening?",4.0,9.436735730639032,4.0,0.191,0.652,0.157,-0.9832,2829,1,1.2164830265588178,0.764

"Just a vent - have no one really to sound off on. I’m one of the first in my friend groups to have a baby, and the ones who did had perfect pregnancies and no complications with their delivery. And my husband is doing so well with handling everything, I wish I could do the same.

But as the title says. Baby was born at 32+2. Pregnancy was going well until 23+5 when I was diagnosed with a short cervix (7-8 mm) after two weeks of cramping. Was hospitalized twice due to concern for preterm labor.

I remember telling my husband that we needed to be prepared to have a preemie. I joined this subreddit around then. Told myself I’d be happy if we made it to 32 weeks. But after those two hospitalizations things were going fairly well. No more cramping/contractions and I was secretly hoping we’d “make it”.

Diagnosed with IUGR at 28 weeks and hospitalized again at 30 weeks after fainting and him having multiple decelerations on the NST when I went in. Started having twice weekly BPPs and dopplers were a little funky but nothing bad, just weird. And his BPPs were always great and he moved a ton.

Anyway long story short had an emergency CS at 32+2 that was quite traumatic. And he’s been doing quite well since then. He was intubated briefly then on CPAP for 2 days. Now we’re at day 10 in the NICU and I’m so over it. I’m tired of leaving my son in the hospital. I hate seeing the NG in him. The leads. Part of me doesn’t want to go see him anymore because it hurts so much just seeing him there and of course leaving is the worse. But when I’m not at the hospital by his side I feel so anxious and can’t focus on anything else really. 

But I feel so guilty. Because he’s doing great and I know all things considered he could be worse off. Like this is only day 10. What about the micropreemies who are on ventilators for a long time? Or the term babies who need surgeries. He literally just needs to learn how to eat. So I feel super guilty that we “have it good” so to speak and I can’t be grateful that he’s doing well. 

And my husband is so level headed about it, but sometimes I feel like he’s minimizing my experience/feelings by saying “oh he’s doing well” or “oh he’s being cared for by experts”.

And to make it worse my maternity leave started and I don’t even have a baby at home. And by the time he is home it will be at least half over. But again feel guilty because some people don’t even get a maternity leave. 

I guess this is just a dilemma of allowing myself to feel sad even though “it could be worse”. I know it gets better but I’m feeling so impatient.",40.0,7.956211944828185,40.0,0.118,0.759,0.123,0.2868,2600,1,0.9592716039346395,4.72

"Hi, 
I’ve posted before with related questions having to do with symptoms over the last year or so involving intermittent and sometimes severe pain, pressure, and fatigue. 

My post history has pretty exhaustive information in it about all that, but I’m currently experiencing a huge increase in one of the symptoms and need to ask advice. 

About a month ago I was diagnosed with a large-ish left ovarian cyst and moderate fluid retention in my abdomen through intravaginal ultrasound and told it is most likely a simple cyst and prescribed watchful waiting. I have an ultrasound and appointment scheduled for October 14th. 

One of the symptoms has been an increase in watery discharge, and while I’ve felt it’s been increasing, overnight it has gotten much worse. It feels similarly to when I was pregnant and my water broke. I woke up thinking I’d been bleeding, but instead it’s a constant leak of clear watery discharge with minimal odor. 


I’m just wondering if I need to speak to my doctor about this or wait for the appointment. 

I have a nexplanon birth control implant that is due out in April, not pregnant, and I’m average to underweight except for some gain in my abdomen in the last year. 
Had one full term birth and vaginal delivery three years ago and recent clean Pap smears but a history of severe cervical dysplasia and pain with sex. I also had a bartholin cyst marsupialization two weeks ago that has seemed to be healing well.

"Hey there babybumpers! I'm here looking for some advice....

My best friend (36f) is about half way through her pregnancy. For years she has struggled with debilitating chronic depression and anxiety. She was on SSRIs for the last few years, which helped her a lot, but now she's pregnant for the first time and weaned herself off the meds. However, it has meant that her depression and anxiety has come back full swing, along with a kind of aggression that she didn't have before. She said her heart rate is going wild, she is struggling with breathing and she can't sleep due to the anxiety. She is also under a lot of work pressure, and working late hours and weekends.  I'm really struggling to support her, as no matter my approach, she is taking things in the worst possible light and pushing people away, including me, her husband and her family. She told me the other week that although she had no intention of harming herself, she didn't want to live any more. However, from what I see, she is self-harming in a way by overworking, not eating healthily, and spending all her free time watching tv and not engaging with people.

I'm really, really concerned about her, but I don't know what to do or how to help her. I'm worried about what will happen if she gets post-partum depression – will that be the same as her ongoing depression or will it be compounded? The ways the I have always supported her in the past just seem to aggravate her now, which I guess is related to the pregnancy hormones, but I'm not sure.

If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it. Even if it's that I should just leave her to her devices until she's ready to be in touch again...

Thank you!",35.0,7.644534148208461,35.0,0.179,0.726,0.094,-0.9821,1700,1,1.9040527603446442,6.265
"Hopefully it's okay to post, because I'm not technically a NICU parent yet.

I ended up in L&D triage last week at 31w2d with a small gush of fluid mixed with blood. It happened again during their inspection of my cervix and they admitted me for the night. Couldn't get confirmation if it was amniotic fluid because the blood was in the way. Moved up to L&D and had more bloody fluid, the Dr estimated about 55 to 100 ccs. Had my first steriod shot that night, started IV fluids and antibiotics. They kept me in L&D for a day, monitoring and measuring baby (fluid levels looked normal compared to previous growth scans, BabyGirl was estimated at 3lb14oz) and then the next day moved me to antepartum until delivery. The suspected diagnosis is PPROM with partial placental abruption.

So here we are at 32w2d. Our goal is to get BabyGirl to 35weeks. I think mentally I've been doing okay but it's an up and down game and I'm hoping someone else here has been there. Some days are great, she does well on monitoring and we just sit. One day she was tachy and we spent 16 hours on the monitor. Some times I use the bathroom and it's clean and clear and then every once in a while there is a small blood clot, or the discharge is darker pink and brown.  Today during both of her monitoring sessions she had a couple of decelerations- that's never happened before and it freaked me out but the Drs who looked it over kept us on a little longer and then we were okayed to go off.

I guess, long story short, is it would be so helpful to know I'm not alone in my experiences with this. To know this can end well.

"After a healthy pregnancy and giving birth on my due date, I am now a NICU mom. A somewhat traumatic birth, that ended up with my baby girl having birth asphyxiation and a many complications to come with it. She had to be resuscitated when she arrived in the NICU. They told us she most likely wouldn’t make it. 

It has now been a week and she is still fighting. She has a brain enema, but the swelling has gone down. She completed hypothermia treatment. She also had a bleed in her liver that has now stopped, but does have a pulmonary bleed that they are treating with different medicines. She originally could not void, but is now pooping and urinating on her own, though she is not urinating as much as she should. She is on a ventilator and sedated. They said her brain and heart function is really good though.

This past week has been really rough. I only have my husband for any support in person as we live in a different country than our families and friends. There is a communication barrier between us and doctors and nurses since the translator isn’t always available. We also can only see her for 5 minutes every once in awhile due to COVID. 

I am struggling because I don’t know many people with kids who have been in the NICU. The few who have been has been due to their children being premature. She is also still considered in critical condition so I am unsure how to feel.

"Hi everyone, I'm looking for advice or experience if anyone has it regarding betamethasone shots for lungs development. 

I'm at risk for early labor with a history of loss at 22 weeks from cervical insufficiency. I'm 24 weeks in this pregnancy, and being closely monitored by a MFM. They gave me my first shot yesterday at my appointment, and I go back today for the second. 

So far labor doesn't look close, and I was a bit blindsided yesterday since I thought they were going to hold out on the shots unless something looked like it was dramatically changing. My cervix had shortened a bit from the prior week, but was still over 3.5 cm. I couldn't sleep and went down the rabbit hole of drug side effects and now I'm worried that if I do make it 2 more weeks gestation out of micro premie range it won't be enough, or it could have side effects. 

Has anyone had any experience with getting the shot and not going into labor within 7 days? Or needing a second round? It's really hard to find any information besides journals that recommend it at 30+ weeks, but we don't always get to pick those conditions do we. 

Thanks for reading, sorry it's a novel.


Edit: Thank you everyone for taking the time and being so kind to answer all of my worries. I ended up with both shots 24 hrs apart, and he passed his NST after some cold juice. Cervix is still holding up, and no contractions in sight.  🤞It keeps going this way and he stays put until I get firmly in the 3rd trimester.

"TLDR: Feeling depressed. I know I can be a great mom, but am worried my depression will pass to/affect my child. And if so, in what ways? I am 5 months pregnant. 


—-
I (29) was depressed a majority of my life, for reasons (mostly bad skin, but also sexual abuse) beyond my control. As a result, I grew up really quiet/shy, and still deal with anxiety in all social situations. I self-studied psychology, happiness, & health...and only by luck overcame my issues - it took years. I was around 24 when I finally “healed” from feeling suicidal (since 9 years old). It also helped that my skin cleared up in my early twenties and people were more receptive to me. 

I feel all that work to be a more confident, positive person is disappearing quickly. 

First, it was due to my ex cheating (he clearly is obsessed with the looks of this woman)/abusing me around the time he got me pregnant. I left and know he isn’t the one for me, but it still hurts. I didn’t press charges and don’t know if I still could/should. 

Then yesterday I found old letters I wrote about being bullied. I don’t even recall being bullied (did I block it out of my memory?). I just remember being socially isolated from peers and knowing why that was being the only one in school with severe skin issues. I was very young, around 9. 

I am scared my child will fall into the depression that plagued my life. One point in my life I didn’t even want children only because I never wanted them to feel what I felt. What if their skin takes after mine?

I keep crying since finding those letters. I just don’t know how to organically gain the confidence to move forward. 

If things did not fall out with my ex, I feel I would have been my happy self that I worked so hard to become, and even happier that I was expecting a much wanted child with someone I loved and “loved” me. I would have been normal.",3.0,8.543303639216722,3.0,0.186,0.693,0.121,-0.9864,1889,3,1.5370630526402778,0.558
"23F, 169cm, 105lbs, biracial

I've been taking a prescription as an intramuscular injection for a few years and I didn't have any trouble at first, but I lost a lot of weight in that time which has made injections difficult. Generally I use a 1"" needle, though I can no longer get the full needle in without causing significant pain. Recently when I bought needles I bought some that are 1.5"" long. It's hard to tell, but I try to get the needle at least one third of the way in. Since losing weight I have often had issues with some of the medicine I inject coming out of the injection site before I get a bandage on and I have had bleeding from the injection site nearly every time.

I decided tonight to look into whether I might not be doing my injections deep enough, but I couldn't find much information other than that an average person needs a 1"" needle and that women have thicker skin than men in most areas of the body. While I was looking up information I saw something that said tingling, draining, and warmth at the injection site are all reasons for a person to call a doctor immediately, but those are common side effects for me. I'm a bit confused about that. 

I'm planning to switch to a different method of delivery for this medication next time I need a refill since I've been having issues with anxiety surrounding injections lately, but I want to know if I'm doing it right because I will likely return to doing injections in the future when my mental health improves.

What I'm most worried about is how deep I'm actually supposed to insert the needle since I'm significantly underweight and whether my medication has likely been less effective if I have not been injecting it deep enough. I did read that muscle tissue can hold more fluid than subcutaneous tissue which I believe should help clear this up. I take 1ml of this medication weekly. The medication is suspended in either safflower oil or sesame oil (sometimes the pharmacy switches, I'm sure that doesn't matter) with benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate. Each milliliter contain 10mg of the medication. Since I have been having anxiety issues I've been paying more attention to how much of the medication I have injected while I'm doing the injection. I've noticed that pain from the injection generally starts when I reach around 0.5ml injected. I never really thought of it before, but I imagine the pain might be a result of overfilling the tissue I'm injecting into. I did read that arm muscles, due to being smaller, can generally hold up to 1ml of medicine, so I assume that if I were injecting into my thigh muscle, as I'm supposed to, and not the subcutaneous tissue that I would be able to inject a full dose without significant discomfort like I used to. I don't know that for certain though. I do fit into size 00 pants, so I probably can't base my expectations on what an average person could expect.

If anybody has any insight which might help me do my remaining injections better I would really appreciate it.",5.0,8.917563104090798,5.0,0.075,0.843,0.082,0.7571,3020,0,0.9145226191927813,0.375

"My daughter is just barely 6. 

We met her 2 weeks before her 3rd birthday. She had been in foster care since she was 8 months old after an alleged sexual assault by her bio father. Bio mom has schizophrenia and bipolar she’s also a drug addict and admitted to using during pregnancy. 

She only lived in one other foster home than ours. 

We adopted her when she was almost 4. 

My husband lost his high paying job and had to take a few different jobs that pay a lot less. He’s in school and working full time for a national coffee chain. 

We also adopted our foster son who we have had since birth and his mother asked us to adopt another of her kids a son that we also took home from the hospital. The week he came home we found out we were pregnant (after four years of trying) and it was twins. I developed HG and became unable to care for myself or the kids so my parents would come everyday to help us. During all of this we found out one of the twins had Trisomy 18 and he died. I carried his body and his twin sister until she was born at 35 weeks. Due to all this drama we sold our hone and moved in with my parents. 

So I’m summary we have four living kids. She’s been through hell. 

She’s always had some difficult issues and we even had her tested for seizures. It was negative. 

The issues we have are: 
Impulse control 
Tics
Urinating on herself and even doing it to get back at me or her daddy when she’s in trouble. 
Listening issues which we are having surgery to help with on Thursday. 
Food hoarding, stealing and binging. 
She doesn’t sleep. She’s up and down all night long. 
Inappropriate emotional responses. 
She looses control and has a full meltdown over VERY minor things. For example she was getting a haircut and the stylist brushed her neck with the comb. She became inconsolable because she thought the stylist had sliced her neck. 
Struggles with learning.
Is emotionally more immature than her peers.
Chews everything. 
Breaks everything. 
No volume control. 
Doesn’t listen to directions and argues back with everything. 
Plays dangerously with siblings to the point she can’t be alone with them. 
Lies. 
Never accepts blame. 
Uncontrollable temper tantrums. 

But she’s also very sweet and has an amazing heart. 

Her pediatrician put her on focalin 5mg. I asked for an OT evaluation and she said not yet. 

I guess my question is, does this sound like more than ADHD? 
If so what could it be?

"How do you cope? Anytime I think of him and being away from him (I was just discharged) All I can do is cry. 

I had Killian at exactly 38 weeks, May 12th. It was a planned c-section, and at delivery we learned his lungs were underdeveloped due to my GD. He is on CPAP, for fast breathing. He is breathing room air now, but he’s still having the occasional episode so they don’t want to take him off of the CPAP. I’m very grateful for them obviously but I am so damn sad. I barely got to hold him, and when I did it was right out of my c-section and I was really really sick from the anesthesia. He’s also receiving phototherapy right now, his jaundice levels are only 10.6 which aren’t horrible, but I was told they peak on the 3rd day, which would be tomorrow so they’re being proactive and I love that. 

I just really miss him. I have a three year old, so the only time I can go to the NICU is when we have a sitter. We have an amazing support system and help, but they have jobs too.

"Just a vent - have no one really to sound off on. I’m one of the first in my friend groups to have a baby, and the ones who did had perfect pregnancies and no complications with their delivery. And my husband is doing so well with handling everything, I wish I could do the same.

But as the title says. Baby was born at 32+2. Pregnancy was going well until 23+5 when I was diagnosed with a short cervix (7-8 mm) after two weeks of cramping. Was hospitalized twice due to concern for preterm labor.

I remember telling my husband that we needed to be prepared to have a preemie. I joined this subreddit around then. Told myself I’d be happy if we made it to 32 weeks. But after those two hospitalizations things were going fairly well. No more cramping/contractions and I was secretly hoping we’d “make it”.

Diagnosed with IUGR at 28 weeks and hospitalized again at 30 weeks after fainting and him having multiple decelerations on the NST when I went in. Started having twice weekly BPPs and dopplers were a little funky but nothing bad, just weird. And his BPPs were always great and he moved a ton.

Anyway long story short had an emergency CS at 32+2 that was quite traumatic. And he’s been doing quite well since then. He was intubated briefly then on CPAP for 2 days. Now we’re at day 10 in the NICU and I’m so over it. I’m tired of leaving my son in the hospital. I hate seeing the NG in him. The leads. Part of me doesn’t want to go see him anymore because it hurts so much just seeing him there and of course leaving is the worse. But when I’m not at the hospital by his side I feel so anxious and can’t focus on anything else really. 

But I feel so guilty. Because he’s doing great and I know all things considered he could be worse off. Like this is only day 10. What about the micropreemies who are on ventilators for a long time? Or the term babies who need surgeries. He literally just needs to learn how to eat. So I feel super guilty that we “have it good” so to speak and I can’t be grateful that he’s doing well. 

And my husband is so level headed about it, but sometimes I feel like he’s minimizing my experience/feelings by saying “oh he’s doing well” or “oh he’s being cared for by experts”.

And to make it worse my maternity leave started and I don’t even have a baby at home. And by the time he is home it will be at least half over. But again feel guilty because some people don’t even get a maternity leave. 

I guess this is just a dilemma of allowing myself to feel sad even though “it could be worse”. I know it gets better but I’m feeling so impatient.",1.0,8.750849075839911,1.0,0.118,0.759,0.123,0.2868,2600,1,0.9592716039346395,0.118

"My baby was born at 28+4 weeks via emergency c-section due to severe early onset intrauterine growth restriction after heart decelerations were detected on the fetal monitor. He came out weighing 1lb 0.2oz and was 10 inches long. It was a placental issue, all chromosomal issues were ruled out. So far he’s had a few issues with his blood work, some jaundice, and had to be intubated for the first few days on low vent settings and low oxygen requirements. He has a PDA and some brady events where he desats but he recovers quickly with stimulation. Blood gases look good, no brain bleeds, no infections, and is gaining weight despite not quite tolerating full feeds yet and only his trophic feedings so far. 

My question is at what age did your baby finally become more alert and aware of your presence? My little guy is 3 weeks old today (almost 32 weeks CGA) and it seems like he just sleeps all the time. Even when he wakes up he opens his eyes and looks at me but doesn’t seem to acknowledge I’m there and it’s hard to even tell if he’s awake or just opening his eyes in his sleep. 

My other son was born at 37 weeks and came out very alert and wide awake, so only a 5 week age difference.

"My guy was born at 34+1 due to IUGR and gestational hypertension and spent 3 and a half weeks in the NICU.  In the NICU he mainly worked on eating and growing out of Bradys.  His stay was pretty straightforward with no major complications. 

I was hoping that others would share their experiences with IUGR. 

I was diagnosed IUGR at 26 weeks and then at 34 weeks was diagnosed with gestational hypertension at my weekly BPP/NST. From there I was sent to triage and then delivery where I delivered via c-section due to baby’s heart rate dropping during contractions.  

Since then my BP is under control and little guy is doing awesome.  He is gaining weight and crushing milestones.  We are very happy.  

When I was diagnosed with IUGR at 26 weeks it seemed like there was very little information about it other than in the few (very scary) research articles.  

There was also a very strange week where the doctors weren’t sure if he had dwarfism or IUGR.

My husband does have a work and he's supportive of me resigning but I just feel guilty for being ungrateful for having a job and if I resign I won't be doing anything aside from household chores. I also suffer from ptsd as my mum was murdered when I was 15 so life have been generally tough for me and I've always been an independent person especially financially. I've attempted suicide 2x due to severe depression and this pregnancy just made me feel I want to live again  for the first in since my mum's death. I feel like I have a purpose in life. 

Should I just resign and focus on my mental health?

"37F, anxiety and panic disorder,  5'5, overweight, meds side effects

Sertraline - 150mg x 2/day
Wellbutrin - 300mg/day
Pariet (reflux medication) - 20mg/day

I don't smoke, do drugs and drink a few times a year in very limited quantities (I worry about the drug interactions with alcohol)

Weirdly, I logged on to ask about these withdrawal symptoms and saw another post called brain zaps describing something different. I didn't want to commandeer their post, so wanted to start a new one. 

I'm having withdrawal symptoms from Sertraline but I've been on it for ~3 years and haven't changed my dose recently. I've been on Wellbutrin for 1.5-2 years, can't remember exactly. 

I'm having terrible headaches and brain zaps every day, worst in the evening, and it's really starting to bother me. I haven't changed my dose recently and take it regularly (I understand the symptoms if I miss a dose but this is happening when I'm on schedule). 
I also have bad night sweats and sexual side effects but those I can cope with if it means no panic attacks. 

This was happening a while back (maybe 6 months ago and had been ongoing for about 6 months before that) and my doctor increased my dose and then later had me split it so I take 150mg in the am and 150mg at night. The thought was that I was going into withdrawal between doses. For about 6 weeks, it was much better but they've been back for nearly a month now. 
I also take Wellbutrin. It was supposed to help combat some of the Sertraline side effects. I'm not sure if it did or not. 

I was on Effexor years ago and coming off was AWFUL. I was in a really solid place mental health wise and it started a downward crash that would take years to get past. 
After cycling through about seven different medications with a real ""guesser"" of a psychiatrist, I got pregnant and just stuck with one that was ineffective but apparently safe for pregnancy. After baby was born, I was referred to a psychiatrist for pregnant and postpartum moms. My anxiety was a MESS. She put me on the Sertraline and it really helped. That was 3 years ago.

I wouldn't say my anxiety is fully under control but it's a million times better than it was. I'm really scared to go off of it and spiral down again but these side effects are making me miserable. 


Has anyone had any success in making the brain zaps and headaches go away while still on the medication? 
Could it be the Wellbutrin as well? 
A friend suggested trying CBD oil but that feels like playing with fire in case it just makes it worse. 

I mentioned it to my GP and he had never heard of brain zaps and they're so hard to describe.

I had a bilateral tubal ligation five years ago following my second c-section and am getting the Mirena IUD on Wednesday to (hopefully) ameliorate lifelong heavy periods that have me in adult diapers four days out of the month.  When I talked to my OB-GYN on October 1st, she told me to get a pregnancy test from the hospital lab the day before the procedure (as well as to abstain from sex for two weeks before, two weeks after).  I asked if it was necessary, since I'd had the tubal, and she said it was.  Fine.

Last week, I called the doctor's office to ask about the cytotec that I was supposed to insert the night before.  I spoke to the nurse practitioner, and asked about the lab form for the pregnancy test.  She said it was unnecessary, since I'd had the tubal.  I asked again, saying that Doctor XXXXX had told me to get the test, and she got annoyed and said that it wasn't necessary.  I was irritated about being told two different things by different people and took detailed notes of the conversation (a similar failure to communicate happened before, when I got a blood pregnancy test for an endometrial biopsy, and was told later it was unnecessary).

My nightmare is that I will get there on Wednesday and not be allowed to get the IUD.  I am desperate to get this done and I've had to schedule it two months in advance.  My husband took the day off from work so he could watch the kids while I go.  I need to get this done.

"Is it annoying when patients call you with questions? If you have one of those late-night exchanges, do you ever roll your eyes at patients who call only to have nothing actually wrong with them?

My basis for this question: I’ve had two high risk pregnancies, called my OB late at night with the first baby because I couldn’t breathe/thought I was dying only for it to be heartburn. Looking back on my second pregnancy, there were probably a few times I should have called the exchange/nurses line, and maybe my preeclampsia would have been diagnosed earlier. But I was too nervous about looking like an idiot if it ended up being nothing, and basically convinced myself everything was normal when it wasn’t. 

Flip side, now I have two children and between the two year old who can’t stop hurting himself/cut his finger and it got infected/had a wild allergic reaction to bug bites, and the borderline-preemie newborn with colic and a weird belly button, it seems like I’ve been into the office at least once a week for things I feel I should have been able to handle on my own. Basically have the nurses number on speed dial because the kids are too young to actually tell me what’s wrong with them and I worry about it.

"I'm sitting here with my wife turning to the internet to see if there is someone out there who might know something.  Let me start with saying that she has given my permission to post and ask for advice and is sitting next to me as we speak.

Here is the down and dirty.  Female, 35 years old, 5'5"", 116 lbs after last paracentesis, fluid is accumulating in her abdomen and we don't know where it is coming from.  She has had a 5 paracenteses performed with the most recent one being today where they removed 2.2 liters of fluid.  The others have ranged anywhere from 800 milliliters up to 4 liters.  She is currently taking 200 mg progestin with the idea of the cause possibly being endometriosis.  She has been taking it for about 3 months and it doesn't seem to be helping.  Blood has been tested...no cancer markers, nothing wrong with the liver, hormones seem to be fine.  We have been dealing with this for roughly 4-5 years and trying to find an answer with no help from any doctor we have talked to.

A little more background...born premature and had necrotizing enterocolitis a few weeks after birth resulting in a bowl perforation and some portion of the colon removed to fix it.  Everything seemed fine until roughly 2011 where she went in for a laparoscopy to see if she had endometriosis and see if they could see anything that might be causing fluid accumulation (this was around the time they first noticed the fluid in smaller amounts).  Long story short, they botched the laparoscopy...couldn't get in with the camera and injured her bowls which resulted in peritonitis.  2013 they took a sample of the fluid and claimed it was just normal cell fluid.  Fast forward to 2017, we start to see an extended abdomen and large amounts of fluid retention.  First paracentesis is in 2018 and they removed roughly 1 liter.  Next one is a year and half years later and they removed 4 liters. Four months later they removed 900 mililiters and five months later (the one today) was 2.2 liters. (Forgive me if my timeline is off but its pretty close). 

The fluid is a dark brown/reddish color.  It's not thick or turbid.  (think a browner tinted red wine).  Anyway, we have seen OB, GYN, Liver specialists/Hepatologists, General Surgeons, Cardiologists, General Practitioners,  Oncologists (even ovarian cancer specialists)...the list goes on in both Germany and the United States.

We have no idea what is causing this fluid to build up and it is starting to wear down all aspects of our lives.  She is in pain with no energy.  Doctors can't figure it out and with the amount of internal scarring in her abdomen, they aren't comfortable doing any surgery to find out (neither is she or I for that matter).  Ultimately, we are just hoping that someone might have seen or heard of a case like this and would have some information to offer since we can't seem to make any headway with it.

Also, I would like to apologize for the long post and I will be available to answer any other questions you might have.  Feel free to private message me or just drop a comment.  Thank you all for your time",1.0,8.937612652224907,1.0,0.051,0.889,0.061,0.4721,3108,0,0.8359285363055237,0.051
"My husband and I trying and recently had a conversation about if we get pregnant and who would be in the room for the actual birth. I don’t want anyone to even know I’m at the hospital until after we are home and comfortable except for husband and my family. He agreed, but mentioned how badly his parents will take this, especially if my mom gets to be in the room. For their other grandchildren they were in the room through the birth or waiting in the waiting room overnight and then stayed with the new parents to “help” (but really just hold baby instead of clean/cook). I’ve seen how my MIL’s countless boundary stomps go unchecked by my sisters-in-law and worry how things might escalate with the golden child (my husband). They range from small comments when she doesn’t agree with something to invasions of privacy to full blown not listening to the parents rules and doing whatever she wants with zero consequences. Neither sister stands up to her. My husband doesn’t really either unless he absolutely has to- he normally just leaves the room or hangs up the phone. If it is important, he stands his ground, but then feels guilty after. 


While it is a little premature, I’ve started a list of boundaries to talk about with my husband so we are on the same page. I’m worried if we don’t talk early enough, things will progress and I’ll have little backup if things get heated. I’m wondering if anyone could share advice or add things I might now even be thinking of. So far my list is:


-Anyone who wants to be around future baby must be up to date on vaccinations(my in laws are vaccinated, but embrace the ideas behind anti-vax - so I’m concerned about boosters) 


-No sharing photos of personal information on social media (my MIL shares EVERYTHING on FB and will vague post about anything that upsets her, making herself the hero/victim of whatever situation) 


-No one will be at the hospital or staying with us. We can have visitors for short spurts a few (days? Weeks?) after birth. 


-No unmonitored time (aka they will never be alone with any kids of ours) - this was my husband’s request before we even got married and I second it. I have no idea how we communicate that without all of my in-laws blowing up at us and making me out to be the bad guy. They think they are the perfect family and the best grandparents ever, so telling them otherwise would be devastating for them. 


If you set any hard rules like this, how did you communicate boundaries with your in-laws? I know the excitement comes from a place of love and I want to embrace that. I also want to keep future baby safe. Our last attempt at communicating boundaries around the holidays went horribly, with my MIL screaming insults at us and crying that we’ve ruined holidays forever and that her son might as well be dead because he doesn’t love her or his sisters. My husband just shut down during the convo and we did what we wanted (though he felt extremely guilty) and after a month of guilting the fight was rugswept by my in-laws.

"Four and a half years ago I gave birth to my son at 31 weeks. My water had broken and within an hour I was at the hospital. A cervical check revealed that my cervix was pretty much fully effaced and I was 1cm dilated. I gave birth 13 hours later.

I am now expecting baby #2 and will be meeting with an OB in two days (I'll be close to 16 weeks pregnant), and I was wondering if I should insist on taking progesterone (through either vaginal suppositories or the 17P shots). I previously met with this OB (two years ago) and he only mentioned monitoring my cervix thickness through transvaginal ultrasounds for future pregnancies and using progesterone if there was evidence of thinning. However, I've recently looked up some articles and it seems like progesterone is often recommended as a preventative measure after having a premature delivery to decrease the risk of another preemie (rather than just waiting for evidence of the cervix starting to thin).

I was just wondering what other moms in a similar situation have experienced and what was recommended to them. Also, for those who supplemented, did you take progesterone vaginally or through shots?",40.0,6.495478210541377,40.0,0.025,0.93,0.045,0.4767,1162,1,0.555432126194179,1.0
"Possible triggers: cancer
Recently I have felt completely out of control hormonal. I am almost 9 weeks and suffer from extreme PTSD as a cancer survivor. I also suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. As a result of my medical history I have completely convinced myself there is no way my pregnancy will go smoothly. 

I have experienced occurrences of spotting since 7 weeks. Never longer than an hour at a time and only usually when I wipe after using the restroom. Generally the “blood/sporting” doesn’t even reach my pad. I have no cramping or other symptoms aside from pretty rough nausea and very sore boobs. Essentially no reason to expect anything bad. 

ALSO should add, at 7 week check up (because I panicked about spotting) I saw my baby bean, heard it’s heart and everything size wise is on track. When I say no reason to worry I really mean that. 

But there is just this overly powerful voice in my head demanding I listen to it and worry about losing my baby. I fear letting people down. I fear not wanting to try again if I do lose the baby. I’m mortified today specifically after a rough night of no sleep and lots of work/moving related stress. 

I guess I’m just looking for some words of encouragement. Natural methods for relaxing as: my bath tub is broken, I’m a (clean for 4 weeks now) pothead, with work coming up (special ed teacher all virtual this year), and a move being made complex by a shitty seller who thinks she can breach contract and force a later move in date. The anxiety has me at the end of my rope and I’m ALREADY taking anxiety meds (baby safe).

"Hello everyone,

I know that this subreddit is for the support for the parents whose babies are in the NICU. Much strength to you guys who were going through tough times and I hope the situation gets better for everyone experiencing this.

We are having twins (MCDA) and the due date is in October. But I just wanted to prepare if we are anticipating few weeks of stay in the NICU. I am concerned mostly about the cost for the NICU stay and the insurance coverage. In general, how much will be the cost for the NICU stay per day and how much the insurance will be able to cover the cost. I talked to my insurance company (UHC) and they told me that there will be a charge of $500/day for the inpatient stay. And I am pretty sure we will hit our out of pocket max ($7.5k for individual and $15k for family) if we are staying in NICU even for atleast couple of weeks.

What will be the better option in terms of insurance and how can I prepare myself to financially manage if there is a NICU stay for few weeks/months?

"My sister is 34 weeks pregnant and the baby weighed just under two lbs last week (at 33 +1).  My sis sees her two doctors (OB/GYN and MFM) twice a week.  The baby had stalled in growth for a while (I am not sure how long) around the same time that my sister was discovered to have some blood clotting disorders.  She has been on blood thinners since about week 22.  Her OBGYN told us this week that the baby will not reach 4lbs before birth (sometime in the next 6 weeks)and will stay in the NICU until she does reach 4 lbs and can eat on her own.  Her original due date was Dec. 16.  Modified due date was Dec 27.  We were told this week she will not go past Dec 20.  Sis has opted to have a c-section whenever the doctors or her body decides it is time.

I can only find info on babies born that small at 24-26 weeks.  i can't find anything about a baby being that small at this gestational age. the baby has gained 10oz in the past month.  My sister's nurse told her today that this is a miracle baby.  I don't think they ever said as much but it is starting to be clear that the doctors and nurses did not expect the baby to survive this long.

"So this is probably going to be a long rant, but I’ve been feeling so hopeless lately and I’m sure I’m not the only one. How are you all coping and living your lives in the midst of all of this?

I’m 24 weeks and due in late September. My husband is active duty military and this is our first baby. I’m so excited for this baby, we’ve been trying for years, and I lost my last pregnancy. I’m so thankful to be expecting this little boy and that he is healthy and active so far.

Being pregnant during all of this just really sucks. So I’m going to complain to the internet because I feel like a jerk when I do it to my friends and family. I just heard my baby’s heartbeat for the FIRST TIME  yesterday because all of my appointments since I was 9 weeks have been over the phone. My husband wasn’t allowed to that appointment and won’t be to any in the foreseeable future. He is also beyond paranoid and has a fit if I even go to the grocery store, so I’ve been essentially isolated since early March (my job moved to 100% remote work in March). I’m dying for a prenatal massage or a prenatal yoga class or something to help with my old back injury flaring up. None of the maternity clothes I’ve ordered online fit right. Literally no one has seen me pregnant at all since we announced except online-and virtual hangouts are getting so old. My birthday is in a few weeks and I have no idea how to safely celebrate and I just have this feeling that I’m going to be isolated for a really long time, especially once the baby comes. When I found out I was pregnant I had planned on traveling to my hometown in July for a baby shower which probably won’t happen now. I guess I had a lot of expectations for this pregnancy because we tried so long for it, and it just hasn’t been what I expected at all.

These are all such first world problems and I feel so dumb complaining about them at all when people are dying. I know why all of this is necessary and I’m trying so hard to be careful for my sake, my baby’s sake, and the sake of people around me. But I guess all the hormones have me especially emotional today and I wanted to see how everyone else is coping. It doesn’t help that I live in a very popular tourist destination that has completely reopened so we are flooded with vacationers who don’t mask or social distance at all, and most people we know don’t really do much to prevent infection. Everyone here has pretty much gone back to normal almost 100% and I’m just afraid to do that? But I guess I feel jealous of their lack of fucks to give. 

How isolated have you been? Is it messing with you mentally? Am I just being melodramatic and selfish?

I am pregnant the second time. 7 weeks, so it is still early.
Now I am concerned that I could suffer early delivery again like I did during the first time.

Background:
My first pregnancy in 2016 was with di-di twins. 
I was doing good in the beginning, no servere morning sickness, all values good.
In week 29 my gyn discovered that my cervix had shortend to 14mm (if I recall correctly) and I had early contractions.
I was admitted to the hospital immediately, put on best rest, received meds to stop the labor (tokolyse, if this is an english term at all?). I also received antibiotics as there seems to have been an infection.
Well, from week 30 on my amniotic fluid got lower and lower.There was probably a leakage in one of the sacks. 
Also, my cervix just ""vanished"" over the time. It was down to 4mm.
At 32 wks the twins were delivered via c-section.

The hospital told me I had a cervix insufficiency.


How likely is it that this will happen again this time? Was it just bad luck, or because of twins? 
Should I mentally prepare myself for long bed rest and a NICU stay?


I will obvl discuss this with my doc, but the next appointment is in 3 weeks and I am just nervous and worried.

"TW: depression, suicidal ideation and thoughts of not wanting to continue with my pregnancy

May be a bit of a deep topic but an important one none the less. 

I have chronic mental health conditions. Severe depression, anxiety and potential PTSD. A lot of trauma in my past around my relationship with my own mother. 

It took me a very long time to manage my mental health prior to becoming pregnant. Lots of trial and error with meds and finding the right counsellor. 

Right before lockdown I finally saw a NHS psychologist (I feel I should play the lottery because I think it would have been easier to win at at that than actually have input from the NHS mental health service!) And I was diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder prior to lockdown too. Been waiting for some specific psychodynamic counselling since. I'll probably still be waiting for it a loong time too.

I am now pregnant and this baby is very much wanted and loved and planned for but I am struggling again and feeling so vulnerable and having conflicting thoughts.

I made the decision to come off my medication for less risk to the baby, so going through withdrawal for that on top of new symptoms and hormones that I have no patience for (you may think it silly but I will have panic attacks if it takes me 20 minutes longer than normal to sleep so this nausea and bloating is driving me insane). I've not had any counselling since lockdown either as my counsellor stopped seeing people due to risk and doesn't do telephone appointments so there's that too. 

The past two nights I have gotten so low that I had feelings of not wanting to be here. Of thinking I can't do this. Of spiralling and trying to think of any negative there could be. I even googled process of how to get an abortion and told my partner I think I have to do that because I can't cope anymore. When I get like this I have severe panic attacks where I hyperventilate and it takes my partner a long long time to calm me down.

I feel so so ashamed and so worried my baby may sense that I even contemplated those thoughts even though I know that's not possible at this point as I am only 4w3d. I feel shameful to admit this on here. 

I DO want my baby and I love my baby so much already. I just feel a lot of struggle managing at the moment and getting through this pregnancy. I also know that I would be a high risk of postnatal depression considering my history.

I am aware that there is a thing called a perinatal mental health service. But my experience of being fobbed off with the NHS MH service makes me feel unsure of what to expect. 

If people who have had experience of it and don't mind sharing what was it like? What do they actually do to support you?",22.0,8.985671771262075,22.0,0.177,0.744,0.079,-0.9964,2743,2,2.240222756613087,3.8939999999999997
"Four and a half years ago I gave birth to my son at 31 weeks. My water had broken and within an hour I was at the hospital. A cervical check revealed that my cervix was pretty much fully effaced and I was 1cm dilated. I gave birth 13 hours later.

I am now expecting baby #2 and will be meeting with an OB in two days (I'll be close to 16 weeks pregnant), and I was wondering if I should insist on taking progesterone (through either vaginal suppositories or the 17P shots). I previously met with this OB (two years ago) and he only mentioned monitoring my cervix thickness through transvaginal ultrasounds for future pregnancies and using progesterone if there was evidence of thinning. However, I've recently looked up some articles and it seems like progesterone is often recommended as a preventative measure after having a premature delivery to decrease the risk of another preemie (rather than just waiting for evidence of the cervix starting to thin).

I was just wondering what other moms in a similar situation have experienced and what was recommended to them. Also, for those who supplemented, did you take progesterone vaginally or through shots?",14.0,6.732167081846247,14.0,0.025,0.93,0.045,0.4767,1162,1,0.555432126194179,0.35000000000000003
"I am trying to look on the positive side now that I am 36+4 and edging towards the end of pregnancy, but I just feel like I'm not really getting care. I don't feel like the midwives listen to me and they are constantly talking over me when I raise questions or ask for information. 

I found out today that things have been documented in my notes that are untrue. for example, apparently I was told at 16 weeks to take iron tablets. No I wasn't, and I specifically asked as I have a history of low iron. My 16 week phone call appointment was horrific. I told the midwife at my appointment that today, and she was not interested in hearing why.

I don't know if my expectations are out of sync of the pandemic has impacted the type of care being provided. Each appointment seems like a tick box exercise and nothing more. I would have thought now is the time to really take care of one another.

"My sister is 34 weeks pregnant and the baby weighed just under two lbs last week (at 33 +1).  My sis sees her two doctors (OB/GYN and MFM) twice a week.  The baby had stalled in growth for a while (I am not sure how long) around the same time that my sister was discovered to have some blood clotting disorders.  She has been on blood thinners since about week 22.  Her OBGYN told us this week that the baby will not reach 4lbs before birth (sometime in the next 6 weeks)and will stay in the NICU until she does reach 4 lbs and can eat on her own.  Her original due date was Dec. 16.  Modified due date was Dec 27.  We were told this week she will not go past Dec 20.  Sis has opted to have a c-section whenever the doctors or her body decides it is time.

I can only find info on babies born that small at 24-26 weeks.  i can't find anything about a baby being that small at this gestational age. the baby has gained 10oz in the past month.  My sister's nurse told her today that this is a miracle baby.  I don't think they ever said as much but it is starting to be clear that the doctors and nurses did not expect the baby to survive this long.

My sister is single, 22, 5'1"".  she weighed about 100lbs but now weighs 124lbs.  she did smoke, drink and do drugs (weed, cocaine, meth) previously but I don't think she has done much more than weed in the 6 months before she got pregnant.  She has always had problems with eating and nausea and now has been diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and some other blood clotting disorders that we had no idea about.  the baby has checked out normal for chromosomal and genetic abnormalities.  No amniocentesis was done. her amniotic fluid values have been between 6 and 8.  baby did have some heart issues (two stenoses and a psuedo hole) but at the most recent ultrasounds the problems seem to have resolved.

what can we expect after the baby is born?  how likely are serious problems?",40.0,7.2423878133419475,40.0,0.055,0.884,0.061,0.501,1943,2,0.9014915587608588,2.2
"Hello, I’m new here. My little man was born on the 31st of July, 9 weeks early, due to severe polyhydramnios. He was finally discharged last week. My partner and I had issues with the nursing staff, and their ability to follow our care plan. We were blamed for what they called a communication break down, despite being there literally every day and constantly making our plan known. 

It got to the point where I was ready to have him transferred. And suddenly he’s ready for discharge two days later? Which I found highly suspicious, but we decided to keep him there instead of transferring, as he had been doing well and we figured we were ready to finally be done with the NICU.

Now my son is home and it’s hitting me hard just how unprepared I am. We didn’t spend much time practicing bottle feeding because I wanted to breastfeed. The lactation consultant never once mentioned that he was tongue tied and that all he was doing was essentially just chewing my nipple and nothing productive or nutritive, she said that he was doing good and just needed more practice. He was starved whenever I tried breastfeeding, and guzzling bottles down when feeding was left to the nurses, though none of this was communicated until I asked about doing the 72 hour, breastfeeding only period, the hospital was supposed to offer before a bottle was ever even offered.

He can’t sleep without a video I found of the NICU monitors playing. I can’t stand the video, I feel like I’m still just at his bedside back at the hospital, but he starts crying if I pause it, so it’s been playing 24/7. My partner can ignore the video playing in the background and doesn’t understand why it bothers me so much. 

I try to talk with my partner, but he just dismisses what I say, won’t accept that my pregnancy and care has been traumatic. All I hear is how the most important thing is that my son is home and healthy, and I agree. But why can’t I acknowledge that things were less then ideal and they were traumatic? Why can’t I mourn the loss of a normal pregnancy, a normal delivery, not getting to hold my son right away?",12.0,7.7335159561395574,12.0,0.086,0.805,0.109,0.8026,2110,3,0.7889184478488211,1.032
"Ive recently found out im pregnant and i am currently 9 weeks. Me any my boyfriend are over the moon and couldn't be happier about this.
I am very happy with my life right now and I have everything ive ever wanted or needed.

However, since becoming pregnant its like my brain is unravelling my entire past. Every deep dark memory ive got, even from around 11 years ago or more.

I had a bad few years when i was a teen, involved in a bad crowd and did very silly things, had some scary experiences and been treated extremely badly numerous times in past relationships. 

Its getting to the point now where most of the days im completely sinking into my own mind and can't talk to anybody and it consumes my whole day and sometimes makes me feel sick, anxious and gives me a whooshing feeling in my stomach. 
Sometimes i just break down crying because it gets too much for my brain to handle. It doesnt help that i work from home and im sat on my own through the day. 

Ive frantically googled my symptoms, to see if anybody at all has experienced the same thing. I found one article where a woman briefly mentioned that ""Pregnancy forces you to face any long-held, deep-seated issues you've been hiding in your life,"" but this is the only relatable thing i have found.
It's really getting to me now because its stopping me from enjoying my pregnancy and focusing on staying sound minded and healthy. Ill stop myself from obsessively going over one memory to the point i get so tired of it that i no longer care, but then a new memory will crop up and alarm me. 

These memories are times i have never thought about until now, things id completely forgotten about until now and have absolutley no relevance to my life anymore because i got myself out of all that a very long time ago and i am now doing really well.

I am just hoping to find anyone who might be able to explain why im feeling this way and how long it may last?",26.0,7.947812527163142,26.0,0.125,0.817,0.058,-0.9697,1942,1,2.1548008963971728,3.25

I am pregnant the second time. 7 weeks, so it is still early.
Now I am concerned that I could suffer early delivery again like I did during the first time.

Background:
My first pregnancy in 2016 was with di-di twins. 
I was doing good in the beginning, no servere morning sickness, all values good.
In week 29 my gyn discovered that my cervix had shortend to 14mm (if I recall correctly) and I had early contractions.
I was admitted to the hospital immediately, put on best rest, received meds to stop the labor (tokolyse, if this is an english term at all?). I also received antibiotics as there seems to have been an infection.
Well, from week 30 on my amniotic fluid got lower and lower.There was probably a leakage in one of the sacks. 
Also, my cervix just ""vanished"" over the time. It was down to 4mm.
At 32 wks the twins were delivered via c-section.

The hospital told me I had a cervix insufficiency.


How likely is it that this will happen again this time? Was it just bad luck, or because of twins? 
Should I mentally prepare myself for long bed rest and a NICU stay?


I will obvl discuss this with my doc, but the next appointment is in 3 weeks and I am just nervous and worried.

"I’m so sorry but this is a rant. So I’m in for my induction today and my partner didn’t come because he has a swollen back. For months I said I should pick a backup person and he said no because he’ll be there. And now I’m just panicking in a hospital crying. To top it all off he’s just messaged to say he had to put one of his pet birds down and went into extreme detail. I’m a sobbing mess, I’m scared, and honestly at this point I don’t know what to do. I do wish he was here but I don’t really want to talk to him any more.

Update: 
I’m not sure if anyone will read this but I wanted to say thank you, you’re encouragement helped a lot. I was moved to the labour ward this morning after a panic attack. I didn’t think I could do it and was going to wait but the midwife told me it would decrease my daughters chances, so I womaned up and went in. I was still freaking out and managed to sort a back up person after the long attempt to get a cannula in my arm (it did take multiple tries and I’m not gonna lie there was a lot of blood). After that my waters were broken and I started having contractions. The machine that registered them was not picking them up but I was in so much pain I was screaming. I was offered an epidural and I did want one however they couldn’t pick up her heart beat anymore and had to put a monitor near her head. Just before this with each contraction I started pretty much screaming “I need a shit”. They went to put the monitor on and realised I could start pushing. From then it was about 20 minutes of pushing. The whole process only took an hour. I didn’t get any drugs in the end because the gas and air didn’t agree with me and the others they had prepped too late. I couldn’t have done it without the amazing team of midwives and I’m kind of thankful for not having a person I knew there, it proved to me that I could do anything. So if anyone reads this and is going through induction, or doing labour alone, you can do it, I believe in you, and I know it will go just as well for you as it did for me ❤️❤️❤️

"Before I found out I was pregnant, I would smoke cannabis once or twice a week, on the weekend to help with anxiety and my runaway thinking brain. I don't drink, I hate alcohol.

As soon as I found out I was pregnant, I stopped smoking and have not touched anything since (23+2).

We both work full time, I've got a professional job, we are just in the process of buying a new house and I have supportive family all around me.

My first urine test was positive and because of that my midwife told me she would have to refer me to Social Services. I haven't been told whether my other tests since were positive or not, but they wouldn't have been as I haven't touched anything, and I pee every time I have an appointment so someone would've said something by now I'm sure.

Anyway, I just wondered what would happen next? 

Will Social Services call me, or want to see me in person?

If my tests are all negative between now and baby birth, would they continue wanting to speak to me?

It feels a bit ridiculous that they only know because I told her, and I only smoked on a semi regular basis and am not addicted, and I've known parents do way worse before finding out they're pregnant... cannabis is legal for medical reasons and there is something called a CanCard out now whereby the police aren't able to take away your cannabis if you have any, so it seems very conflicting how they treat people.

"31 year old female, currently 24 weeks pregnant with second child. 5’2 130 lbs with history of scoliosis. 

I am currently pregnant with my second child and plan on a scheduled c section since my last birth in 2016 ended up a c section. I was originally induced and opted for an epidural during my labor. The epidural was placed by a resident with his attending guiding him. He told me he hit CSF and it was possible I would experience a headache from it (I never did). Not even 15 minutes later my eye began to droop and I developed patches of numbness on my breasts. Called in the nurse who then called anesthesiology to explain my symptoms, and within minutes the head of anesthesiology, the attending and the resident were back in the room. I was told I developed a reaction called “Horner syndrome” likely because I was given a bolus of meds in the epidural and had a reaction. They told me that I was fine since I was not in respiratory distress and made it seem like this was NBD and even common? Like “oh you’re fine just horners syndrome, no more bolus though!” But it was kind of scary and I thought I was having a stroke. Then to find out I could have had respiratory distress from this was scary too. The drooping and numbness resolved within hours and I was fine. I wound up with a c section due to failure to progress, and while being prepped in the OR I told them I could feel everything on my left side. The OR anesthesiologist then sat me up to look at my epidural and told me it was completely coiled, placed badly, that I have bad scoliosis and the other option was to do a spinal and if that didn’t work I’d need general. Luckily the spinal worked. 

Anyway my question is now that I am being scheduled for a repeat c section is it likely this is going to happen again? Is Horner syndrome from an epidural really that common because my OB nurse told me she’d never seen it before and I haven’t found much in doing my own research on the topic.",39.0,7.467039721749067,39.0,0.083,0.862,0.055,-0.9534,1967,2,1.508816578803854,3.237
"I (28F) gave birth to my daughter in December 2018, so she's almost 1 and 1/2. I still occasionally have panic attacks when I think about her birth, particularly the pain during the last two hours of pushing.

The context: My water broke spontaneously, but after 10 hours of intense labor, I was still just at 2cm. They then injected me with something to induce me, and things progressed more quickly. Also, my daughter was ""sunny side up"" and a month early. I had a failed epidural, and wasn't offered anything else for pain.

It took two hours of pushing to get her out. The worst part was this HORRIBLE pain between contractions: it felt like my back was being split open and my legs torn off. The pain would start as one contraction was ending, and end as soon as the next one began. Because the contractions were the ""resting"" time for me, I was falling asleep and hallucinating while pushing, then the pain would come back. I could have never imagined enduring and surviving such pain.

I thought I would ask here, because I haven't been able to find a mention of anything online, and my friend who's a midwife (with her Master's) hadn't heard of anything like this.

"TW: depression, suicidal ideation and thoughts of not wanting to continue with my pregnancy

May be a bit of a deep topic but an important one none the less. 

I have chronic mental health conditions. Severe depression, anxiety and potential PTSD. A lot of trauma in my past around my relationship with my own mother. 

It took me a very long time to manage my mental health prior to becoming pregnant. Lots of trial and error with meds and finding the right counsellor. 

Right before lockdown I finally saw a NHS psychologist (I feel I should play the lottery because I think it would have been easier to win at at that than actually have input from the NHS mental health service!) And I was diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder prior to lockdown too. Been waiting for some specific psychodynamic counselling since. I'll probably still be waiting for it a loong time too.

I am now pregnant and this baby is very much wanted and loved and planned for but I am struggling again and feeling so vulnerable and having conflicting thoughts.

I made the decision to come off my medication for less risk to the baby, so going through withdrawal for that on top of new symptoms and hormones that I have no patience for (you may think it silly but I will have panic attacks if it takes me 20 minutes longer than normal to sleep so this nausea and bloating is driving me insane). I've not had any counselling since lockdown either as my counsellor stopped seeing people due to risk and doesn't do telephone appointments so there's that too. 

The past two nights I have gotten so low that I had feelings of not wanting to be here. Of thinking I can't do this. Of spiralling and trying to think of any negative there could be. I even googled process of how to get an abortion and told my partner I think I have to do that because I can't cope anymore. When I get like this I have severe panic attacks where I hyperventilate and it takes my partner a long long time to calm me down.

I feel so so ashamed and so worried my baby may sense that I even contemplated those thoughts even though I know that's not possible at this point as I am only 4w3d. I feel shameful to admit this on here. 

I DO want my baby and I love my baby so much already. I just feel a lot of struggle managing at the moment and getting through this pregnancy. I also know that I would be a high risk of postnatal depression considering my history.

I am aware that there is a thing called a perinatal mental health service. But my experience of being fobbed off with the NHS MH service makes me feel unsure of what to expect. 

If people who have had experience of it and don't mind sharing what was it like? What do they actually do to support you?",11.0,9.28846103700134,11.0,0.177,0.744,0.079,-0.9964,2743,2,2.240222756613087,1.9469999999999998

I'm not sure if it's relevant or not but I had a stress test and echocardiogram almost exactly a year prior with no note of any such thing (I'm not sure if that's something you'd actually detect with an echocardiogram though?) 

The notes from the hospital say there is no significant stenosis and my arteries are parent. But I did have severe pre-eclampsia and HELLP with my daughter 5 years ago. My blood pressure never really went back to normal after that and I've been on meds since (although for a period at first I was not very good about them). 

One thing I noticed when I was in the ICU was that my BP was actually quite low. I kept asking them if they had given me my BP meds because it was sort of alarming to me. Usually if I don't take my meds it will shoot up. They hadn't and they just kept shrugging it off like it was irrelevant (maybe it was but it bothered me and no one ever gave me an explanation for it)

I also had what I thought per my now former family doctor was asthma or a type of reactive airway disease. I get these bouts where my chest or lungs kind of squeeze and then I cough and it squeezes more, round we go. Sometines it down we come with an obvious URI but other times it's been mid summer and I don't have any other symptoms of a chest cold. This happened actually right before I ended up in the hospital and I was given a 10 day course of prednisone (something that I've had many times before) which is probably what really took my blood sugar over the edge. The attending in the hospital (who was a pulmonologist apparently) was very clear I don't have and he said my symptoms were caused by postnasal drip and GERD. I do have a postnasal drip but I've never really had heartburn in my life before the ketoacidosis outside of pregnancy. 

I have an appointment with a cardiologist coming up in November. That's a pretty fast turnaround for a specialist around here but it's an eternity for me. I'm really stressed out about it (which doesn't help I'm sure) I'm a single mom of the most amazing 5 year old girl in the universe and I don't want to drop dead. Dr. Google only makes me more anxious. 

I'm almost 43. I'm 5'4"" and now about 190lbs. I dropped about 50 lbs in the maybe 2-3 months right before I wound up in the hospital (probably should have been a clue something was wrong). My blood sugar is now perfect and well controlled with insulin and diet. Besides the preeclampsia the only other thing I can think of that could be relevant is a history of anxiety disorders (which is probably obvious lol).

"I (28F) gave birth to my daughter in December 2018, so she's almost 1 and 1/2. I still occasionally have panic attacks when I think about her birth, particularly the pain during the last two hours of pushing.

The context: My water broke spontaneously, but after 10 hours of intense labor, I was still just at 2cm. They then injected me with something to induce me, and things progressed more quickly. Also, my daughter was ""sunny side up"" and a month early. I had a failed epidural, and wasn't offered anything else for pain.

It took two hours of pushing to get her out. The worst part was this HORRIBLE pain between contractions: it felt like my back was being split open and my legs torn off. The pain would start as one contraction was ending, and end as soon as the next one began. Because the contractions were the ""resting"" time for me, I was falling asleep and hallucinating while pushing, then the pain would come back. I could have never imagined enduring and surviving such pain.

I thought I would ask here, because I haven't been able to find a mention of anything online, and my friend who's a midwife (with her Master's) hadn't heard of anything like this.

"Hey guys! 

So I'm currently 37+5 and I'm trying to decide if I want to Induce or not. For some backstory, I went into preterm labor at 34 weeks, 50% effaced and 2 cm dilated. We expected me to go into labor by now, but I haven't. 

My husband just started a new DoD job and hasn't been on long enough to take paternity leave, however he can go into ""the hole."" Meaning, he can take as many weeks of leave as he wants, but has to make it up over time. As a civilian, he earns 2.5 days of leave per month, so if he took two weeks it would take a few months to make up. HOWEVER, with the current pandemic he is working two weeks on two weeks off. During his two weeks off, he's on administrative leave and still earns a paycheck and leave time without taking personal leave. 

If I talk to my OB about induction this week, I could Induce at 39 weeks and husband would get two weeks off. I wanted a natural unmedicated birth, but induction seems like it would be the best option for us. What do you guys think?

"TW: depression, suicidal ideation and thoughts of not wanting to continue with my pregnancy

May be a bit of a deep topic but an important one none the less. 

I have chronic mental health conditions. Severe depression, anxiety and potential PTSD. A lot of trauma in my past around my relationship with my own mother. 

It took me a very long time to manage my mental health prior to becoming pregnant. Lots of trial and error with meds and finding the right counsellor. 

Right before lockdown I finally saw a NHS psychologist (I feel I should play the lottery because I think it would have been easier to win at at that than actually have input from the NHS mental health service!) And I was diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder prior to lockdown too. Been waiting for some specific psychodynamic counselling since. I'll probably still be waiting for it a loong time too.

I am now pregnant and this baby is very much wanted and loved and planned for but I am struggling again and feeling so vulnerable and having conflicting thoughts.

I made the decision to come off my medication for less risk to the baby, so going through withdrawal for that on top of new symptoms and hormones that I have no patience for (you may think it silly but I will have panic attacks if it takes me 20 minutes longer than normal to sleep so this nausea and bloating is driving me insane). I've not had any counselling since lockdown either as my counsellor stopped seeing people due to risk and doesn't do telephone appointments so there's that too. 

The past two nights I have gotten so low that I had feelings of not wanting to be here. Of thinking I can't do this. Of spiralling and trying to think of any negative there could be. I even googled process of how to get an abortion and told my partner I think I have to do that because I can't cope anymore. When I get like this I have severe panic attacks where I hyperventilate and it takes my partner a long long time to calm me down.

I feel so so ashamed and so worried my baby may sense that I even contemplated those thoughts even though I know that's not possible at this point as I am only 4w3d. I feel shameful to admit this on here. 

I DO want my baby and I love my baby so much already. I just feel a lot of struggle managing at the moment and getting through this pregnancy. I also know that I would be a high risk of postnatal depression considering my history.

I am aware that there is a thing called a perinatal mental health service. But my experience of being fobbed off with the NHS MH service makes me feel unsure of what to expect.

They never massaged my stomach after birth, even with the PPH. They served food with mold all over it. I gave birth a year ago and I’m still sad about my experience.

"I'm a first time mom, 6+2 weeks pregnant, with a long history of moderate to severe mental health issues. Mainly treatment resistant depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and substance use issues. I've had appointments with my psych doc to discuss this before and after my pregnancy started, and he suggested I stay on the bare minimum medication that I need to function.

"Also posted in  r/Medical

I (40F) have congenital hydrocephalus. My last shunt revision was in 1994! I was discharged as a paediatric patient and never had a new neurosurgeon after that.

In 2018 I was suffering migraines and sent for a CT which came back clear. It turns out I was in early stages of pregnancy and developed gestational diabetes early on and needed insulin. The diabetes disappeared after the birth. The diabetes and pregnancy seemed to account for my symptoms as I felt better after I was on insulin and the birth. I delivered via elective c-section as they felt that was safer than labouring or pushing for hours.

However, I am still having headaches and migraines, especially lately. I strongly feel I need an MRI and feel I need a new shunt. I'm not sure if it's a blockage but could I have a cyst or perhaps an infection? Are VP shunts meant to last a lifetime? I just don't feel right. I have written to the hospital I was originally treated in but the notes I received are incomplete. I only know it's a Delta shunt but nothing more. It isn't a programmable shunt, as far as I know. But until doctors know more, they refuse to do an MRI in case it is dangerous? or intervenes with my shunt type. I feel very abandoned and helpless.

"I know I post way too much here by now but I have a few feeding questions and any input would be greatly appreciated. I have a 43 week old (born at 39 weeks so technically not a preemie but small for gestational age) who recently had heart surgery a little over 3 weeks back. He has taken a good amount of formula and donor milk through a bottle before surgery but now he takes 99% of his feeds through the ng tube. I call and ask every day how his feeds are progressing but I have the feeling its just easier for the nurses to leave him on the ng feeds then it is to work with a fussy baby to take his feeds through a bottle but that really, really scares me because while he has made some progress in his feeding so far (he didn't used to be able to take bolus feeds but now he keeps them down) I'm worried I might have to take him home with either the ng tube or a gtube.

Its hard for me to be there for him because me and my husband share a car and he works most of the day but I'm going to try and stay longer to supervise his feeding and try the bottle feeding myself (He only takes just under 10 mls sadly) because I'm more willing to work through his fussiness because he's my child and I'm his only real advocate. I can't stand the thought of him lying there with an ng tube damaging his intestines knowing that if I were there maybe he would eat more. Every time I've held him so far he seemed to move closer to my breast, I know his ability to suck and swallow is there and I've even seen drink a bottle before with no issue. Can anyone give me advice on what to do? Techniques to try? What I should ask of the nurses? Will I have to accept the reality that he will need to come home with the tube?

"Can anyone give me your tips for getting your baby to take fortified milk that they don’t like?

Some backstory:

My 28-weeker came home a few weeks ago. We were told to fortify half his feeds (so, 4 bottles a day) to 24 calories. He had some weight loss in the NICU from being on IVs during an episode of bloody stools, so he’s still gaining “catch up” weight.

He’s got a dairy allergy, so we’re using Elecare. He hates it. He doesn’t like the taste, it makes him horrifically gassy, his poops are watery and stress him to the point of giving him bloody stool. We tried Alimentum, and he didn’t like that either.

We did a trial run with just nursing for five days, and he was like a different baby. Less gas, settling at night. But, he didn’t gain enough - only 3 ounces in 5 days. The doctor wants him to jump weight percentiles to catch up on a weight loss he had while still in the NICU.

We’ve tried feeding him in a bouncer seat to distract him a little, which seems to work the best. Anything else is an hour of spluttering, choking, crying, spitting, to get down *maybe* 40mL. We were told to try for 60 at a minimum per fortified feeding, but he just shuts down and won’t do it. Even if he’s hungry.

Any suggestions/tips? Editing to add, his current gestational age is 43 weeks. So I think he’s a little too young to try something like oatmeal, although the doctor suggested I could do that in another month.",12.0,7.29799526346765,12.0,0.087,0.831,0.081,-0.1848,1432,2,1.073941488705098,1.044

Anyway, onto my problem. So obviously from the info above I take norethisterine, which is a ‘mini pill’, basically the birth control pill without oestrogen. I’ve been taking it for a long time and I’m on it to help with my periods because before they were extremely heavy and would often last longer than average. I know that something this pill can do is stop periods entirely, but i must’ve been on this pill for over a year now and I would still bleed monthly, just not for as long and they would be a bit less heavy. This was the norm until recently, I know that i’m way overdue for my period but there hasn’t been anything of the sort for probably 1.5-2 months now. Ive had spot breakouts which i generally get around the time of my period but haven’t bled at all. I haven’t been sexually active for over a year if that information is helpful. I’m not sure whether i should be concerned about it or if it’s just the result of the norethisterine, it just seems odd because the pill has never stopped my periods fully in the year i’ve been taking it.

As long as I can remember I’ve always bruised super easily. My legs and arms were/are constantly covered in bruises. I’m a stay at home mom so I don’t do much, especially with COVID, so I don’t see how these  recent bruises could be from trauma. 

During my pregnancy, I was anemic so I was instructed to take an iron supplement daily. I had CBC’s done pretty regularly, and after taking an iron supplement without it improving my HCT, I was then instructed to take iron twice a day. My HCT was still going down. The last CBC I had done was a day after my c-section, and I was still anemic (no doctor told me about this, I just saw it from looking at my lab work through my patient portal). I was never instructed to follow up, and being a brand new parent, I didn’t even think of it. I also know being anemic isn’t very uncommon during pregnancy. Before my pregnancy I never got lab work done regularly, but I did a few times throughout the years and my HCT was always WNL. Not sure if any of this is even relevant.

I haven’t been to a PCP in 10+ years, and finally have an appointment to get myself established next month. What type of testing should I bring up? I also have some symptoms of ehlers danlos classical type. My symptoms are hyper elastic skin, very soft velvety skin, and hyper-extendable joints without dislocating, just to name a few. My joints are often achey and have crepitus, but it’s not debilitating and NSAIDS help. I also have scoliosis with a 23 degree angle in my lumbar spine.

I went to the dermatologist and she did a skin biopsy on my thigh (which was at first itchy and then suddenly lot of pustules formed within a day or two) [4](http://imgur.com/a/YZ1U1bm) It is "" mixes infiltrate with papillary dermal edema, spongiosis, and subcorneal pustule formation"" And she told me to stop using the anti fungal cream just keep the area clean and dry since not sure what it is.

But after that it got a lot worse, it's spread to everywhere (except my face , hands and feet) and became bigger area with dark red rash underneath. My thigh was the worst, it feels like burning and tingling, so it's hard to walk too. [today, same biopsy site](http://imgur.com/a/lSH2fKi)

She gave me Keflex antibiotics and now I'm on 6th day, it's not improving and most area are still spreading. I had the worse night ever last night because most places just have burning tingly sensation, plus it's all over my belly and thigh, so it hurts a lot when trying to move around.

Called my dermatologist this morning, she said bacterial culture came back negative, still waiting for DIF biosy result. But both her and my OB advised me to go to a university dermatology since it seems pretty rare.

"Premature ventricular contractions vs 110BPM

I have lots of health problems but this worries me the most. I'm 32, 6'4"" 290lbs down from 329. I quit soda entirely 8 months ago, after going from 2x 2 liter of mountain dew a day for years, down to 1x 2 liter of cola a day, then for the last year and a half of drinking soda, 3 cans of cola a day. These last 8 months I've been sooooo good, my wife and I both switched to completely unsweetened lightly flavored Seltzer's like ""Aha"" brand. I drink 8-12 cans a day.

I have numerous psychological disorders but the ones that affect me physically the most are anxiety and PTSD. 

Before I became aware that my resting heart beat is an average of 108BPM, my previous doctor diagnosed me with PVC. I've also had high blood pressure in the past but now I'm only slightly on the high side of normal. She decided to treat me for anxiety in addition to my psych provider. I don't remember what the doc put me on but it caused excessive mood swings, made me sleep too much, exhausted, and psych discontinued it. Since then psych has become increasingly concerned about my heart. My new primary on the other hand remarks how high my heart rate is at the beginning of every appointment, then goes on as usual. At the behest of psych, I asked my primary for a Holter monitor, right as we were changing my meds around as I complained to psych about the PVC and was beginning to think it was one of the meds causing it. The med change here was coming off of Minipress (for PTSD night terrors) because psych thought that might be causing the PVC and by the time I got scheduled by the hospital outpatient lab and fitted with the Holter, PVC was gone and the 72 hour test was ""normal"". 

Now: I've been on clonodine for 2-3 weeks. My anxiety is slightly better according to my wife (she says I pick less) but the PVC is back with a vengeance! The fluttering 2-3 times a minute is keeping me awake at night and distracting me from Lambda School during the day. BUT my heart rate on the clonodine is an average of 82 BPM

I'll answer any and all questions! I want to live!

Other physical maladies:
GERD, IBS, degenerative disc disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (I don't drink), very high ANA but no diagnosed auto-immune disorder (possible Buschets if I'm spelling that right), gout (no symptoms just very high uric acid), and migraines. A severe case of periodic limb movement disorder affects my sleep. I do not have diabetes, my A1C is perfect, tested many times by several doctors in disbelief.

I smoked 2 packs a day from 13-26, non-smoker for 6 years now.

Meds:
Wellbutrin
Clonodine
Lyrica
Prevacid
Pepcid
Alipurinol
PRN Ativan
PRN Flexeril
PRN Maxalt

TL;DR: Which of them will kill me first? 108 BPM resting without clonodine, or 82 BPM resting on the clonodine but with PVC 2-3 times a minute?",22.0,8.463766604589937,22.0,0.086,0.833,0.082,0.7209,2872,2,1.048652603341056,1.892
"Hello, please know I am an open book and whiling to answer questions but the answer to my question isn’t “higher output then input” if this is your answer please respect I won’t reply. 

I am a 29y female 120kg(260lb), 5’ tall, PCOS with infertility, asthma when playing sports or in cold conditions, currently coming off Escitalopram with a history of steroid use for body building. Caucasian.

In 2015 I had weight loss surgery (gastric sleeve) to loss weight after gaining 50kg(110lb) in the space of 12 months (broken ankle requiring multiple surgeries and months of bed rest) and not being able to loose it at the advise of my then GP/PCP. Pre surgery I had to do a VLCD aka shake diet for 2 weeks in which I lost 3kg (which I believe was water weight as it was the first couple of days) then 2kg post surgery. 

It is coming up to 5 years and my weight has not moved, not a single kg/lb, I had a baby 6 months ago and walked out from having the baby at exactly (I cannot stress this enough) the same weight only gaining 4kg the day before having the baby(weekly weigh ins). I have spoken to a new go/pcp who simply advised I was over eating and not exercising enough. I have seen an endocrinologist who has tested me for many things, tried me on injections for weight loss which also did nothing, had me on excessively high calorie diet to see if I could gain weight which I didn’t and then excessively low calorie diet to loose weight again which I didn’t. I have been advised my next step would be to have gastric bypass surgery which I personally don’t feel like would work as I am not an over eater. 

A brief history, I have always been short I am 5’ (151cm) extremely fit and weighing in around 50kg (110lb) for most of my life, as well as an ex body builder in the bikini division where I did take an illegal substance Clenbuterol during my last competition I am not sure if this is a factor. I have also had PCOS since I was 14 with a period every 6 months for 2 days but fell pregnant with my son at 19. But with this baby was 2 years of trying with fertility medication. My blood pressure has always been reasonably low (even during pregnancy) 100/50?, do not have fatty liver, hba1 4.2, low cholesterol.  Not sure if it is relevant but my pregnancy ended in waters breaking at 31 weeks.  

An example of my diet is coffee for breakfast, either a sausage or chicken sandwich for lunch, dinner, and a snack size packet of chips for dessert. I cannot consume more then a fist sized amount of food. 

So basically I am unsure how to proceed. I understand I will not return to the small person I was but physically my body is suffering and I would like to loose a reasonable amount.",7.0,8.796942546817839,7.0,0.095,0.837,0.068,-0.9224,2706,1,1.3968534039111895,0.665
"29F, 5’2, 160lb

My upper right eyelid has been twitching every few minutes while awake for over seven months now (it lets up at night). I had a full physical and eye exam last Feb, when the twitching had been happening for about a month. Clean bill of health minus slightly high cholesterol. I was told it’s multi-factorial caused by all the following:
Sleep deprivation from new baby
Stress/anxiety (I have GAD)
I work in advertising and can spend easily 10+ hours a day in front of a computer. 
And the cherry on top, I have very stubborn eczema on my eyelids that flared up during pregnancy (treating and mostly cleared up, but chronically irritated eyelids). 

My doctor recommended trying to relax and sleep more and stare at the computer less. I’ve managed to accomplish 2 of the 3 - taking breaks from my work is a challenge. I’ve since moved states and the twitching has kept on keeping on. I have no other concerning vision/neurological symptoms. The twitching has stayed consistently the same. 

The twitching has become a source of anxiety in itself and Dr Google is not good company. Is it possibly something more sinister that I should be worrying about at this point?

"Hi there - I have a few simple questions. (27f) 170lb, white. Current meds: lexapro 10mg daily, iron 325mg daily, omeprazole daily, folic acid daily, vitamin d2 weekly, melatonin as needed, zofran as needed. Prior dx: ptsd, depression, iron deficiency anemia, and ibs-d

Been thru the ringer w random symptoms over the past few years. Mainly dizziness, joint pain, headaches, fatigue, rashes, and two short bouts of vision loss. However that’s not why I’m here. 

My pcp ran B and D vitamin panels recently to examine whether my history of alcoholic abuse left me with any long lasting deficiencies that could explain my symptoms. She found that I have a vitamin D2 deficiency as well as folic acid very very low. Since we weren’t discussing my period bc we were focused on other stuff I didn’t get a chance to ask her this, which is why I’m here: 

Is it possible that my periods are very light (3 days max, very light flow) because of the folic acid deficiency? I can’t find anything that feels reliable on google about the effects of folic acid deficiency except for as it relates to pregnancy (I’m not pregnant).

"I went to my pcp back in June when I first noticed this because I dropped down to 118lb from 125 in maybe a year — I'm not actually sure when it happened as I wasn't weighing myself. Anyway, he ran a whole bunch of tests — CBC, inflammatory markers, A1c, metabolic panel, thyroid, celiac, abdominal ultrasound, lung x-ray — all came back normal. He said it was probably stress, and to keep an eye on it and see if it happens again. And if so, he would send me to an endocrinologist because he didn't know. I do have anxiety and a lot of stress, but I've been stressed my whole life (diagnosed with OCD) and I've never lost weight before. I was also struggling with infertility and in the process of doing an IUI at the time, and was advised to go ahead and keep doing that.

So anyway, I kept an eye on it, started exercising more to help with stress. My weight actually went up a couple of pounds, so I thought the problem was done with. The IUIs didn't work, so insurance finally approved a round of IVF. I did an egg retrieval — weight still good. Then I started prepping for a transfer cycle. Around a week before my transfer, my weight suddenly started dropping again. I was on Estrace, and had just started Crinone and Progesterone in Oil, and was on several other supplements, and I thought they were responsible. Fast forward 2 weeks — I've done my transfer, and it stuck! Which is amazing after four years of infertility. However, my weight is still dropping, and I don't know what the hell is wrong. In 2-3 weeks, I've lost about 5 pounds. And this is obviously causing an insane level of stress, especially now that I'm hopefully actually pregnant.

The fertility clinic did another thyroid test and said my tsh was a bit low (.02) and they sent me to an endocrinologist, who did a full panel of thyroid tests (still waiting for those) but said that level of tsh is perfectly acceptable in pregnancy. And that if my thyroid isn't the problem, she can't help me. I'm at a complete loss at this point, as my PCP also told me to see the endo if this keeps happening (and my thyroid was all in range at the time!), and she doesn't seem to think it's my thyroid and she can't help with anything else? I literally have no idea what's wrong. I mean I'm going to wait for the results, obviously, but she doesn't seem to think my thyroid is the problem. And if it isn't, what doctor I should see then?? Should I go back to my PCP and have him send me somewhere else? I don't have any other symptoms of anything that I can think of — except according to my apple watch history, my resting heart rate has increased slightly for the same time frame as this weight loss, and I'm wondering if it's related. I did mention this to the endo, and she had no comment.

I will also note that I had a previous molar pregnancy and 8 months of chemo treatment with  methotrexate and then act-d, though I'm hoping this is not in any way related. I did not lose any weight during that time.

Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions? Anything?

Thank you.",22.0,8.527854130451193,22.0,0.111,0.805,0.085,-0.9204,3050,7,1.3057287377955535,2.442
"A little background:

My 2 year old was born 9 weeks early due to me having preeclampsia, which resulted in IUGR for her - she stopped growing in utero at 29w, born at 31+1. 

She caught up with all milestones except for weight/height percentiles at about 1 year old.

She’s not potty-trained. This is just a diaper issue.

I’ve tried reasoning, I’ve tried suggesting showing her toys how we squat to poo, I’ve tried putting her in the squatty potty position in my lap to try and help her out, but none of it is working. 

She does a pretty good job of staying hydrated throughout the day, and we give her a decent variety of fiber-containing foods. 

What happens when she normally tries to go is that she will stand stiff as a board, and get on hir tiptoes to push it out....super counter-productive. 

My best guess is that she had lots of really bad diaper rashes when she was an infant (thanks, extra calorie preemie formula), and she maybe got scarred mentally from the pain of those? 

I’m not sure if this is normal, something that just clicks when she’s ready to potty train, or something else entirely.

I am curious if any other people who were/are pregnant are dealing at the same time with depression and/or taking medication can talk about their experience...

I am currently being treated for depression and anxiety and being followed both by a doctor and therapist.

However in the back of my mind I am still worried about the whole ordeal, if I should just keep postponing trying for a baby with my partner until I am ""cured"".  But part of postponing trying for a baby is also what has been causing distress to me so I don't know if I am being naive by thinking that having one will contribute to make me feel better. I am also worried if I would get some kind of severe post-partum depression since I am already so sensitive (lol).

I have been way overdue for a tetanus shot (last shot was 14 years ago), and after getting a second degree burn on my arm today, I decided it was time to get it done because I’ve had a lot of anxiety after getting wounds lately due to fear of tetanus. So after a teledoc appointment, I went to the pharmacy and got my tetanus booster 4 hours ago.

The reason it has taken me so long to get it is because I remember getting a fever as a child after my vaccine, and I have not wanted to have to miss work/other events due to having a fever and feeling sick. Now that I have gotten the shot, I worry that if I develop a fever, I might have to take off time from work until I can get tested for Covid, as well as test negative. I am a teacher, and my first day of work is on Thursday. 

I know that knowing if I will or won’t develop a fever based on my past experience won’t change anything, but I’d like to be prepared to make a plan. Is it likely that if I got a fever from the booster as a child, I will get a fever now after getting the shot?",40.0,6.858709835002516,40.0,0.08,0.875,0.046,-0.8922,1266,1,1.738752445120626,3.2
"I’m so sorry but this is a rant. So I’m in for my induction today and my partner didn’t come because he has a swollen back. For months I said I should pick a backup person and he said no because he’ll be there. And now I’m just panicking in a hospital crying.

I do wish he was here but I don’t really want to talk to him any more.

Update: 
I’m not sure if anyone will read this but I wanted to say thank you, you’re encouragement helped a lot. I was moved to the labour ward this morning after a panic attack. I didn’t think I could do it and was going to wait but the midwife told me it would decrease my daughters chances, so I womaned up and went in. I was still freaking out and managed to sort a back up person after the long attempt to get a cannula in my arm (it did take multiple tries and I’m not gonna lie there was a lot of blood). After that my waters were broken and I started having contractions. The machine that registered them was not picking them up but I was in so much pain I was screaming. I was offered an epidural and I did want one however they couldn’t pick up her heart beat anymore and had to put a monitor near her head. Just before this with each contraction I started pretty much screaming “I need a shit”. They went to put the monitor on and realised I could start pushing. From then it was about 20 minutes of pushing. The whole process only took an hour. I didn’t get any drugs in the end because the gas and air didn’t agree with me and the others they had prepped too late. I couldn’t have done it without the amazing team of midwives and I’m kind of thankful for not having a person I knew there, it proved to me that I could do anything. So if anyone reads this and is going through induction, or doing labour alone, you can do it, I believe in you, and I know it will go just as well for you as it did for me ❤️❤️❤️

Extra update:
I even cut the cord and tbh that felt great too ❤️❤️❤️

Ps: 
This isn’t pregnancy related but I wanted to remind you guys because I forgot. after you’ve given birth trust your instincts. My daughter wasn’t feeding and only 2 midwives took my concerns seriously. She went from a freezing screaming but very sleepy baby who couldn’t fill a nappy, to a warm content bubba after some formula. I felt something was wrong and had to talk to over 10 midwives before someone saw my concern and saw she was dehydrated. The second midwife helped even more and now the two of us have even slept a lot more which is making us less stressed.

"29 / USA / Male

I was playing with one of my friends dogs today and had this pull toy we were doing a “tug of war” with. It was a complete accident, but the dog was biting and scratching as it was pulling on the toy and accidentally got me.

He’s a big dog and was slobbering everywhere and drew the tiniest amount blood from the bite/scratch (it happened so fast I’m not sure what caused it). 

My buddy apologized and I had no issue, we were just playing. I asked if the shots were up to date and he said yeah, but called the vet to confirm. 

The vet said the rabies had actually expired since he was due for one in July 2019. The dogs rabies vaccines history is -

-	August 2012
-	July 2013
-	July 2016

So, while the dog is overdue for the vaccine and needed one in July 2019, it’s had three shots in its life. My buddy is super apologetic and his dog is indoors like 99% of the time and he’s getting the booster shot on Monday, but what does that mean for me?

Is there any risk I could get rabies if the dog had recently been exposed to something in the last year?

Hypothetically speaking, how long would it take to know if I’m going to be okay or not? Can my buddy watch the dog or does it need to be quarantined?

"12 months, female, 21lbs, 30.8 inches. Takes famotidine 1ml twice a day for reflux. During my labor and delivery with her she continuously had heart decelerations and while I was pushing her heart rate was undetected altogether even on an internal monitor. She was fine was out but weighed 5lbs 14oz. I was volunteerly induced because my midwife told me there was virtually no risk. (Which I quickly discovered during the process was not true) A few hours after her birth the nurse notice she was very lethargic,  after testing her sugar and taking her temp they put her under a warmer and we decided to give her some formula. Within about 4 hours she was doing much better. The second or third night home while laying on her back, swaddled, and in a crib she started choking. I brought this up to the doctor who thought nothing of it. I also brought up to her that we were having trouble with nursing on one side and she told me I just ""need to relax."" 

At 5 weeks she was diagnosed with a dairy intolerance and we switched to soy formula (supplementing) and I cut out dairy. This diagnosis was based on mucus in stoll and not on the choking. She continued having choking episodes and even vomiting sometimes. At 7 weeks she was diagnosis with torticollis and we began PT.  After some PT she has full range of motion.  The choking continued and we finally got a referral to a gastroenterologist. He ordered a swallow study and found she was protecting her airway.  He also diagnosed her with a soy intolerance because of frequent skin rashes.

I think it is important to state here that the test was only 1 minute long and the radiologist complained about being there. She also didn't choke during it. 

Because there was no aspirating detected he prescribed her famotidine and it has never really worked. It helps but she still frequently chokes after drinking anything and she wakes frequently from sleep choking and gasping for air. 

At 7 months old she started doing these weird movements that we and her pediatrician were concerned was infantile spasms. We quickly got her in for a 48 hour EEG. This showed not seizure activity  and we were told it could be sandifer syndrome. 

Fast forward to her next GI appointment we ask about it and he isn't too concerned. Next appointment which we just had at 12 months he suggested we do an endoscopy and ph test to see what's going on. We will be doing those at the end of the month. 

I almost guarantee I am forgetting to add something here. If I remember anything I will edit to add. My question is are we looking in all the wrong places? It's been a year and we still have no real answers. Is she aspirating and they didn't catch it on the swallow study? She frequently sounds raspy after choking and her breathing sounds wet if that makes sense. Could this be related to her lack of detectable heartrate at birth? Possible birth injury? Or could it be something really simple we just aren't seeing? Any input would be appreciated.

"25 yo F
~170 lbs
31 weeks pregnant
History of anxiety and POTS
Non smoker 
Regular prenatal care 

OB sent me to cardiology for some follow up after I had a bad dizzy spell I attributed to POTS. Cardiology did an echo which came back completely normal. Put me on a 2 week heart monitor to be sure expecting it to come back normal. I was in sinus rhythm as expected and some sinus tach (expected—my resting heart rate during my second trimester was often between 110-130). But I had several runs of SVT and one brief run of v tach. I also had some PACs and PVCs.

As a former L&D nurse I understand just enough of this to make me stress. He thinks it is pregnancy induced and said my heart is healthy, just my body is going through a lot (I also had HG and stayed dehydrated a lot of my pregnancy—even ended up on fluids). I will repeat the tests after I deliver and he expects the problems to be resolved. 

I will follow up with OB of course, but my appointment is over a week away and I’m starting to stress. What could this do to my pregnancy? Increased risk for IUGR, pre e?! Will I need to be induced? If so, when? C section or can I deliver vaginally? What is the current recommendations for delivering patients with these types of arrhythmia?

Essentially as the title says, I had a PPH with my recent delivery. I have VWD so I basically had a 1 in 4 chance of it happening. I lost 750ml immediately after delivery, and was treated with tranexamic acid, syndometrine, misoprostol and ergometrine

About 2h later they got me up to go to the shower and I had a secondary bleed. I lost a lot of blood in the shower that we weren't able to measure, but what we were able to measure was another 250ml minimum, as well as some large clots. A doctor was called and I was given more tranexamic acid and told that if the bleeding didnt stop in 10 minutes they would have to give me a general and go up to surgery to try to stop the bleeding. 

Fortunately my hemoglobin levels stayed okay through the whole thing and my recovery so I didnt need a transfusion but the whole thing was pretty traumatic and obviously I would like to avoid it where possible in future pregnancies. Is there anything I can do to prevent it in future? Would a C-Section be easier to manage because its a controlled wound as opposed to a vaginal delivery?

Sometimes, I can’t breathe randomly for 10-30 seconds until dry hack up a lung. Like I legit cannot inhale even a tiny bit. 

Happens a couple times a year for like the last 15 year when I’m both awake and asleep. Like I literally can’t inhale or speak. It’s always been when I’m asleep until last xmas where I had an episode in Costco over the holidays.

Bit of health background: I was 3 months premature at birth, but the doctors gave my mom a shot to develop my lungs and they’re generally good. Twice on my life I ended up on Advair when I lived in Asia. Once due to shadows in my lungs in the Middle East and the other in China due to allergies causing a secondary chest infection because of spring pollen and pollution. 

I do have allergies, I’m actually allergic to cats and own two who sleep with me. For the past two years o wake up some mornings wheezy. But the not breathing thing has been much longer than that. 

I had a breathing test in January and I didn’t meet the threshold for improvement with Ventolin to be labeled asthmatic, though there was some quantifiable improvement in the before/after comparison. My doctor didn’t know what else to label it as other than allergies.

"Today was an extremely rough day and I broke down in front of the physical therapist.

A little back story: My LO was born at 27+6 on July 31st due to unknown reasons. I went into preterm labor after a normal pregnancy with no issues on the 28th and they did everything possible to stop it but couldn't. I have been pumping since day 1 but since he was on the CPAP until a month ago, we have little practice with breast feeding. However, I do try to go to the NICU every day to try to breast feed or bottle feed at least once.

The hospital has all the pressure around breast feeding. I don't know how it is with other hospitals but this one really stresses it. They have lactation specialists, and even the physical therapists and speech therapists that see my son highly recommend it.

For the last week or so, my LO has not been latching well to my breast with or without a nipple shield and only takes a fraction of what he does with the bottle. It has been very discouraging and frustrating. I am able to pump almost twice as much as he needs per day so it's not a production issue.

Today, after yet another unsuccessful breast feeding session, I broke down in front of the physical therapist all because she asked how I was doing with the breast feeding. He has been in the NICU for over 70 days now and I just want him home, all he has to do to come home is eat enough through the nipple. Add that in with the breast feeding, I was at my wits end.

I don't know what to do. I am just so tired and overwhelmed. I never expected to be in this position or in the NICU at all.

Does any one else feel this pressure to perform when they can't when it comes to breast feeding?

Thanks for letting me rant. I'm going to try to get some sleep now until my next pumping session...

TLDR: The hospital's pressure to breast feed is overwhelming and exhausting.

EDIT: Part of my frustration was the physical therapist herself. I know she is just tying to help us. However, when I asked her the benefits of breast feeding vs bottle feeding my breast milk she said that there's something different that comes out when you breast feed that the pump can't get?

Though I didn't really post, each story, heartwarming or scary really touched me. Everyone one of you are so damn strong and amazing parents. 
My NICU adventure was completely from left field. I was diagnosed with Preclampsia at full term (39.5 weeks) and was induced within hours of diagnosis. Baby boy was so healthy throughout pregnancy. Then during a long pushing process he suffered with shoulder Dystocia and lost oxygen. He was unresponsive when they laid him on my chest. 
He went from the 72hr cooling pad therapy, to oxygen, to feeding tube to now a normal baby. I'm so thankful our road wasn't as long as most ❤️
With all of that explained....to NICU parents who are home with their babies ...how did you feel?
I love my son. I've cried over my son. I love to bond with my son, whether that's when he latches or just holding him and hearing him breathe. 
He was discharged yesterday. And though I was, and am, so relieved..I thought I would be more excited. Now it's just pumping, changing, holding him and feeding him.
Family members keep asking if I cried tears of joy during discharge, and I didn't. 
I'm not sure if I just haven't had time to process but I'm just moving forward with our new life now. No NICU visit, scheduling early intervention, making sure he starts associating night time with longer naps...etc.
I can't help but feel like a bad mother..that I wasn't more excited or emotional.

"26, female, 4 foot 10, 120lbs, Asian. I’m trying to verify the approximate date of conception of my pregnancy. I am currently about 8 months pregnant as far as I know. I had an unwanted sexual experience last September, and then had regular consensual sex with my husband in October. I found out I was pregnant in November and as far as I know the baby was conceived in October. I’m pretty sure it was, but I still get worried that something weird might have happened and caused ultrasounds or hcg levels to be off, like if my body produced hcg so slowly that it seemed like the baby was conceived in October but it was actually earlier? Is this possible?

Data points:  

* Period Sept 9-12 (sex Sept 12)  
* Possible period or spotting Oct 10 (31 day cycle)  
* Positive pregnancy test November 11  
* Quantitative HCG test Nov 12: 882.5 mIU/mL (5-6 weeks?)  
* Ultrasound Dec 20 placing me at 9w6d (expected 10+1 based on LMP)  
* Ultrasound Jan 3 placing me at 12w (expected 12+1)  
* Ultrasound Mar 4 placing me at 19w6d (expected 20+6)  
* Ultrasound Apr 16 placing me at 25w6d (expected 27w)  

A few more points:

* I have had periods ranging from 24-32 days but usually had regular periods around 28 days. I believe my LMP was Oct 10 which was a 31 day cycle from Sept 9-Oct 10. I don’t know if I remembered it correctly or if maybe it was some kind of early pregnancy spotting instead.  
* I took Plan B back in June which led to a couple very short cycles (15 and 19 days) before returning to normal length. I don’t know if that would affect my ovulation pattern.  
* I was taking Monistat before my September cycle hit and don’t know if that has any effect on ovulation timing either.  
* I have always been very petite and was less than 100lbs before pregnancy, I was born full term but physically “premature,” I don’t know if this would have any relation to a baby growing slowly.

No ultrasounds since then and I may not get another one. All the dates seems to indicate conception during October. I am told early ultrasounds are very accurate. But is there any unusual situations that could cause ultrasounds or HCG to be a month off when dating pregnancy? Does a gestational age of 10 weeks (like in my December ultrasound) always indicate conception around 8 weeks ago or is it possible to have conceived earlier than that? Or should I assume that it was definitely October?

Thank you very much in advance.",10.0,7.579124036355354,10.0,0.02,0.92,0.06,0.9643,2446,6,0.3332777870354941,0.2
"My baby has been breech since around 32 weeks, but I’ve otherwise had an uneventful pregnancy. 

I am scheduled for a c-section tomorrow at 39 weeks and had a growth scan yesterday at 38+5 to check positioning and size before delivery. This was my first ultrasound since the anatomy scan at 20 weeks. I was told after my anatomy scan that everything was looking good and on track, but given no specific measurements. 

At my growth scan yesterday, I noted when she measured baby’s femur that it was showing on screen at 33 weeks + some number of days. The humerus also seemed to be measuring around 33 weeks. Head and abdomen measuring about 40 weeks. All of these values I read off the screen as she was measuring, I wasn’t provided with this info by the tech or anything. The tech did tell me that his estimated weight is 7lb 1oz and sent me on my way. 

I (of course) googled the femurs measuring so far behind and got results such as Down’s Syndrome and various forms of dwarfism. Cue me freaking out for the next 12 hours. 

I had my follow up appointment this morning and mentioned my concerns to my doctor regarding the femur and humerus lengths, and she said that they are measuring behind (again I wasn’t given exact values/percentiles/what GA they were measuring), but didn’t give me much indication what this means either way. She did say that if this had been seen at 30 weeks, for example, she may have referred me to MFM for more scans and genetic counseling if I would’ve wanted it, but that since we’re so close to delivering, it will be easier to assess baby once he’s here. 

She did say that she looked back at my anatomy scan and his femurs were 20-30th percentile then, and asked my height and my fiancé’s height. I’m 5’4”, he’s 5’7”. She suggested he could just be a short baby (although if he’s truly off by 5 weeks, that seems more significant to me than just being short) and that scans this late aren’t always accurate and his breech positioning may have played a role in this. She didn’t comment on other possibilities such as DS or dwarfism, just said we’d see him tomorrow and look him over. 

Can anyone speak to the level of concern I should have for a chromosomal or skeletal abnormality for our baby?

"Hello! 
I’m looking for advice because I’m a little lost at the moment. I (F18) have had pretty severe cystic acne for about six years now. I have been going to a dermatologist since I was 13, and was put on Accutane after we went through all of the other options. It cleared up my acne just fine. The only real side effect that bothered me was the chapped lips, but even that I could deal with. It was worth it to have clear skin. I stopped taking it and now my acne has come back. I’ve been off of it for about 3 years now, so I’m able to go back on it without time being a problem. I have talked to my dermatologist about it and she thinks it’s a good idea for me to try it again. The only issue is that now, since I have a gynecologist, I have to have her approve of me going back on Accutane. The first time I was on it, I did not need her approval for whatever reason (I believe age had something to do with it); all I needed from her was a prescription for birth control (Accutane can cause severe birth defects if I get pregnant while on it, so I must be on some form of birth control). I tried to get my gynecologist to sign off for me to start it again but she will not unless I get an IUD implant. I’m already on an oral birth control, so I’m not seeing the need for an IUD. My gynecologist said that her reasoning for giving this ultimatum is because she does not feel as though I should be on Accutane due to the side effects (but again, I was on it once before...), and because having an IUD implant would be basically 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. As a side note, I disagree with this last statement of hers because one of my best friends had an IUD, and was on a birth control pill, and still got pregnant with her second child. Additionally, I have never even had an exam done on my private area for personal reasons. I’m terrified to have someone touching me there, even a medical professional, because of insecurity about my appearance and because of some trauma I have had in my childhood. I would be scared to have an IUD put in for these reasons. My friend who has had one has also said that it was painful and uncomfortable for her. 
I’m wondering what my options would be for how to proceed. I really want to get back on Accutane because the acne is very painful and it makes me insecure about my appearance. I don’t feel as though it’s appropriate for my gynecologist to basically decide for me that I cannot be on it, considering that I’ve been on it before without an issue. And, I’m already taking an oral birth control and I have had to sign paperwork stating that I’ll use two forms of birth control (my oral pill, and condoms) when I have intercourse.

"Hi. 29F Caucasian. 5'9 193lbs. 

Doctors said I have had an enlarged spleen and liver for a prolonged amount of time. (They told me my spleen should be 10 in length at largest and mine is 14.5) I get reoccurent pain in the spleen area and sometimes to the navel. The pain can sometimes radiate upward as well. They found this on a scan to rule out kidney stones due to lower right flank pain three weeks ago. My primary doctor set me up with some bloodwork (CBC and rheumatoid arthritis testing) and they said both came back okay. They have been very vague on if I should worry or what this might be, only stating that by the CBC there is no reason to worry of leukemia or infection. Referred me to a gastrologist but the soonest I can be seen is October in my area. Do I have reason to worry? Is their anything specific I should be researching or is more likely that I have? The not knowing and waiting is very difficult, especially under my circumstances. 

Pre-existing conditions include: Neuropathy/Ridicopathy, Spinal Stenosis (lumbar), Slipped Disc (Thoracic), PMDD, OCD, PTSD. They also found a nodule on my lung and did a rescan a year later and saw no growtb, so told me it was nothing to be concerned about. I don't think this would have anything to do with it but I had three c sections in my life -- 2012, 2015, 2017. Last pregnancy I had the condition they labeled ICP (i don't know how to spell the condition name, told me it wouldn't effect me after pregnancy but it did involve the liver)

Family history: Cancer (Leukemia, Lung Cancer), Chrons Disease, Heart Disease, Angina, Tachycardia, Parkinson's Disease, Diverticulitis/osis, 

Medications include: Zoloft 100mg , hydroxizine half tab of lowest xozdw, clonidine half tab for lowest dose for mental illness relief and zofran for nausea

I do not drink, have probably drank a total of five times in my life and it was never more than a beer. I don't like the stuff. I smoked for about three years (mostly through vaping) and am weening off of it now. I have used marijuana in the past.

I’m not exaggerating when I say that this is keeping me up every single night, just brainstorming what it may be. I’m not particularly afraid of having cancer or anything, I just can’t stop thinking about what it MIGHT be. It’s so frustrating. My next appointment is not until in December.]

“Measurements: The uterus measures: 10.5 x 4.4 x 5.5 cm. Right ovary measures: 3.3 x 2.8 x 2.6 cm; 13 cc. Left ovary measures: 4.0 x 3.4 x 2.2 cm; 16 cc. Endometrium: 8 mm.

FINDINGS: Transabdominal findings: Transabdominal images are limited. Endovaginal findings: Uterus: The uterus is heterogeneous. There is no focal endometrial lesion. Endometrium: The endometrial stripe is heterogeneous and mildly prominent at 8 mm. There are tiny cystic foci identified within the endometrium measuring up to 3 mm maximally. Adnexa: There is no adnexal mass. Flow is seen within each ovary without secondary signs of torsion. Multiple follicles are seen within both the left and the right ovary. Clinical correlation is advised. Given the configuration, correlation with possible polycystic ovarian syndrome is recommended. Fluid: There is no free fluid.

IMPRESSION: POSSIBLE POLYCYSTIC OVARIES. PROMINENT ENDOMETRIUM WITH TINY CYSTIC FOCI. NO WORRISOME ADNEXAL MASS. OTHER FINDINGS AS ABOVE.”


My current issue, condensed: irregular menses, infertility, abdominal and pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding
Long version: SO & I have been trying to conceive since the removal of my IUD 9 months ago, my cycles came regularly for a while although they were anovulatory, until I had 8 straight weeks of heavy menstruation beginning first week of September. I explained this to my new OB-GYN in October, who ordered the ultrasound. Follow-up for endometrial biopsy was scheduled at the same time as the ultrasound, but it’s not until December. 

Relevant medical history: polycystic ovaries, endometriosis (surgically confirmed), 3 live vaginal deliveries, 1 first trimester miscarriage, hypothyroidism, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, chronic high WBC, and family history of breast, lung, and brain cancer

Relevant surgical history: right ovarian cystectomy laparotomy in 2010, post-partum retention of placenta requiring a D&C in 2014, cholecystectomy in 2014, post-partum exploratory laparotomy for diagnosis of endometriosis and abdominal adhesions in 2019

Lab results, condensed: WBC high (11.5), neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes are borderline high, calculated osmolality is low (274), FSH 5.2, LH 18, prolactin 6.8, testosterone serum 44, TSH 1.010, T3 122.3, T-4 0.9, HcG < 1, DHEA sulfate 171.0, 17-OH progesterone 96, EGFR 94

So, Dr. Google and late night anxiety has suggested endometrial hyperplasia and uterine cancer, so that’s what I’m prepared for, but obviously I’m hoping it’s not. I’m driving my SO crazy staying up all night, so he suggested I turn to Reddit. 

The only thing worse than having a period for 2 months straight and every other week since is laying in bed at night wondering what the hell a heterogeneous endometrium is and what cystic foci are... Please just give me some feedback that’s more personalized than my Google results. Thank you!",4.0,9.906529052166604,4.0,0.104,0.836,0.06,-0.9889,3632,0,1.7330444925845692,0.416
"**Hello, doctors of Reddit!**

**Please, replies from doctors only.**

**Multiple perspective/advice is appreciated. Anything to get me headed onto the right track, I'll participate in. I tried to be as detailed as possible, but if you have any further questions, feel free to question.**

* What happened?
   * Cut finger on the door latch of my room. Not the deepest cut per se, and small. Produced beaded blood, though. 
* How did you treat it?
   * Drenched a paper napkin in alcohol and pressed it onto the wound, applying pressure for the bleeding trickling to stop. After a couple minutes, washed it and then put a new alcohol-drenched paper napkin on it with pressure. It stung that time.
   * Washed the area around it, then put an antibacterial ointment on a bandage and strapped it.
   * Kept it like that for like 10 minutes, then washed it under running water again for a minute and 30 seconds or so, then applied ointment (no bandage).
   * In the textural indents of the skin, there were tiny little veins of brown. I thought maybe it was a bruising effect, but it turns out it was drying blood. It didn’t rub off or wash off, I had to scrape it off with my finger. Made sure to not get it into the wound, and it wasn’t inside, just around the skin like a stain.
   * Wound is clean now, not bleeding even a little bit, etc.
* Concerns?
   * Have definitely gotten a tetanus shot before, but I don’t think it was anytime recent. Not in the last 5-10 years if I had to guess.
* Site of infection (body & area)
   * Upper right index finger.
   * On a stiff door latch. No dust on the latch itself, use it often, relatively clean, but around the inner edges where my skin must’ve been caught was a weird, blackish dust or something. Almost looked like soot when I swiped a finger there. Guess I'll have to carry a first aid wipe with me now to clean every surface I touch :(
* **Questions that I would like to be answered, please:**
   * Won’t be able to go to the doctor unless symptoms arise. Is it possible that, if symptoms of Tetanus arise, that I can still get treatment and recovery can be possible?
   * If this happened to you, what would you have done?
   * Anything else I should do to treat the wound or something I should look out for (symptoms besides the normal infamous lockjaw associated with this).
* Additional info:
   * I’m 19, almost 20, female, 5'3.
   * This happened at about 8:10 in the AM, about two hours ago give or take a few minutes.
   * I’m living in Asia (I’m writing this as I’m sure tetanus isn’t common in the US, where I got my tetanus shot at one point in time.)
   * No, I cannot go to the doctor immediately. Telling my parents I need to get a tetanus shot because I got a random cut would have them bringing me to a mental asylum instead 🤡.
   * Don’t have any other health condition (heart diseases, pregnancy, diabetes, etc.)…that I know of, of course.
   * **If you want, I can give you a picture of the wound + black dusty thing, if that makes it easier.**

"26, female, 4 foot 10, 120lbs, Asian. I’m trying to verify the approximate date of conception of my pregnancy. I am currently about 8 months pregnant as far as I know. I had an unwanted sexual experience last September, and then had regular consensual sex with my husband in October. I found out I was pregnant in November and as far as I know the baby was conceived in October. I’m pretty sure it was, but I still get worried that something weird might have happened and caused ultrasounds or hcg levels to be off, like if my body produced hcg so slowly that it seemed like the baby was conceived in October but it was actually earlier? Is this possible?

Data points:  

* Period Sept 9-12 (sex Sept 12)  
* Possible period or spotting Oct 10 (31 day cycle)  
* Positive pregnancy test November 11  
* Quantitative HCG test Nov 12: 882.5 mIU/mL (5-6 weeks?)  
* Ultrasound Dec 20 placing me at 9w6d (expected 10+1 based on LMP)  
* Ultrasound Jan 3 placing me at 12w (expected 12+1)  
* Ultrasound Mar 4 placing me at 19w6d (expected 20+6)  
* Ultrasound Apr 16 placing me at 25w6d (expected 27w)  

A few more points:

* I have had periods ranging from 24-32 days but usually had regular periods around 28 days. I believe my LMP was Oct 10 which was a 31 day cycle from Sept 9-Oct 10. I don’t know if I remembered it correctly or if maybe it was some kind of early pregnancy spotting instead.  
* I took Plan B back in June which led to a couple very short cycles (15 and 19 days) before returning to normal length. I don’t know if that would affect my ovulation pattern.  
* I was taking Monistat before my September cycle hit and don’t know if that has any effect on ovulation timing either.  
* I have always been very petite and was less than 100lbs before pregnancy, I was born full term but physically “premature,” I don’t know if this would have any relation to a baby growing slowly.

No ultrasounds since then and I may not get another one. All the dates seems to indicate conception during October. I am told early ultrasounds are very accurate. But is there any unusual situations that could cause ultrasounds or HCG to be a month off when dating pregnancy? Does a gestational age of 10 weeks (like in my December ultrasound) always indicate conception around 8 weeks ago or is it possible to have conceived earlier than that? Or should I assume that it was definitely October?

Thank you very much in advance.",30.0,7.409175988785696,30.0,0.02,0.92,0.06,0.9643,2446,6,0.3332777870354941,0.6
"My baby has been breech since around 32 weeks, but I’ve otherwise had an uneventful pregnancy. 

I am scheduled for a c-section tomorrow at 39 weeks and had a growth scan yesterday at 38+5 to check positioning and size before delivery. This was my first ultrasound since the anatomy scan at 20 weeks. I was told after my anatomy scan that everything was looking good and on track, but given no specific measurements. 

At my growth scan yesterday, I noted when she measured baby’s femur that it was showing on screen at 33 weeks + some number of days. The humerus also seemed to be measuring around 33 weeks. Head and abdomen measuring about 40 weeks. All of these values I read off the screen as she was measuring, I wasn’t provided with this info by the tech or anything. The tech did tell me that his estimated weight is 7lb 1oz and sent me on my way. 

I (of course) googled the femurs measuring so far behind and got results such as Down’s Syndrome and various forms of dwarfism. Cue me freaking out for the next 12 hours. 

I had my follow up appointment this morning and mentioned my concerns to my doctor regarding the femur and humerus lengths, and she said that they are measuring behind (again I wasn’t given exact values/percentiles/what GA they were measuring), but didn’t give me much indication what this means either way. She did say that if this had been seen at 30 weeks, for example, she may have referred me to MFM for more scans and genetic counseling if I would’ve wanted it, but that since we’re so close to delivering, it will be easier to assess baby once he’s here. 

She did say that she looked back at my anatomy scan and his femurs were 20-30th percentile then, and asked my height and my fiancé’s height. I’m 5’4”, he’s 5’7”. She suggested he could just be a short baby (although if he’s truly off by 5 weeks, that seems more significant to me than just being short) and that scans this late aren’t always accurate and his breech positioning may have played a role in this. She didn’t comment on other possibilities such as DS or dwarfism, just said we’d see him tomorrow and look him over. 

Can anyone speak to the level of concern I should have for a chromosomal or skeletal abnormality for our baby? We declined genetic screening in the first trimester because we have no family history and are both young (24 and 25), but now I’m regretting that a little bit. In your experience, would you have concern for fetal abnormalities?",17.0,7.831249476813859,17.0,0.027,0.911,0.062,0.9473,2474,2,0.43541364296081275,0.459
"Hello, I'm a 22 y/o female, engaged, I don't smoke cigarettes,  I smoke Marijuana through out the day to eat and focus and feel more elevated rather than depressed sometimes. I get about 6-8 hours of sleep depending. I try to eat 1-2x a day when I can. I'm 5'4, 117 pounds, white. I take gabapentin 300mg for anxiety, 7mg of mirtazapine for depression, and Janel birth control. 

Anyway, I take trazadone 150mg  to sleep so far its the only thing that actually keeps me asleep for the whole night. I don't really dream either. When I don't take trazadone I have vivid dreams. Lately I've been sleeping early and waking up early with anxiety.  Fluttering heart, a heavy pit is in my stomach, and my breath becomes shallow or harder. It feels like I should lay down and just not move because of it. I feel it from my navel to my collarbones every morning. 

I've noticed it's more prominent when I sit up or stand rather than lay down. I'm currently laying on my side focusing on this to try and not be so anxious.  
I hate to take my gabapentin as soon as I wake up and risk being tired for a while. Because sometimes the trazadone already has me in a fog.. but I'm so anxious. 

I'm so tired of waking up anxious and sick. It takes a while for the anxiety to actually ease.. I just don't want to change my sleeping medication. I've been on it for 2-3 years now and it took so long to find something that actually made me sleep for more than 5 hours. 


Idk if any of this helps: 

I have digestive issues too. And I've been trying to understand why? I had biopsies and an endoscopy, check ups im also taking omeprazole. Sometimes if I get anxious or stressed the stomach acid gets really bad, I'm constantly burping and nauseous or feel like I may throw up. Or I actually do. Especially when im depressed or numb enough to not eat.. I'm starting to wonder how much of this is neurochemical? Or brain damage? 

I was dropped down a flight of concrete stairs and they discovered I had Coronal synostosis. They preformed the procedure to correct it and I'm not sure what damage there is now. I'm also 26 weeks premature and weighed about a pound, I spent 3 months in an incubator unable to be touched because lungs and skin were last to develop.. I know that being in a box has greatly affected me. I have a hard time with emotion, physical touch and what ever..",11.0,8.657640839666215,11.0,0.133,0.819,0.048,-0.9893,2373,3,2.770256196625703,1.463

I've never seen a gynecologist before, I've never had a pap smear, I am sexually active occasionally/rarely

I have an appointment with a gynecologist in the morning

A couple years ago I had a suspected yeast infection that turned out to be BV. They didn't do a full pelvic, just used a speculum to get a swab. I cried after. 

2 weeks ago I had the same thing. First swab went fine, doctor also felt my cervix really quickly, uneventful. Second time, last week, was a different doctor, and she did what I assume was like a minimal version of a pelvic? She did some bimanual examination. I don't really remember much. Afterwards I realized I was really really dissociated with derealization. That lasted like half an hour. Then I cried. I cried during every phone call I've had to make scheduling this.

I don't know why I'm reacting this way. I don't have any sexual trauma that I know of. I am meeting up with a close friend immediately after and not driving, and I have an appointment with my therapist in the afternoon. 

**Can anyone tell me what they'll likely do / what tests will be performed? Will I have to have a full pelvic? What will that entail? How long will it last? Will they do a transvaginal ultrasound?**

Also, will the doctor allow me to do the whole the dissociated if I warn her ahead of time and tell her I don't want her to try to bring me out of it if I seem zoned out? I'd really rather not be present for it, and not having vivid memories would be a bonus.",17.0,8.278128195136532,17.0,0.13,0.811,0.059,-0.9839,2437,7,2.2030164378918826,2.21
"I'm a 41F, married w/ 4 children. Medications include Vyvanse, Pristiq (for premenstrual dysphoric disorder) multivitamins, & magnesium.

My question requires some back story, & you'll soon see why it's relevant. 
The amount of stress I've been under in the last 10 years has been astronomical:

-getting out of poverty 
-moving every 2 years w/husband's jobs
-bed rests for multiple pregnancies (7 pregnancies in 9 yrs, 4 living children, 3.5 years *total accumulated* time spent vomiting uncontrollably, or on bed rest, during that time) 
-I've had little continuity of care, except for OB issues, because of moving across multiple counties or states. 
-All six family members have ADHD + other issues. My two youngest kids have sleep disorders. My husband has OCD & ASD. This means that, since my 3rd daughter was born, I've likely only slept in 2 hour intervals, for abt 9 years. 
-My oldest daughter has a rare combination of illnesses that I basically had to research & develop a treatment for. ADHD, OCD, SPD, ASD, & a pediatric eating disorder. She didn't eat the day she was born. She's been through 3 sessions of Maudsley Refeeding, 1 hospitalization, & finally stabilized once we got the ADHD + OCD treated properly.

This is just necessary background info incase someone says, ""You're just stressed out! Sleep! Go on vacation!"" I can't do that. The kids are 6-15 yrs old.

Since last year, I've started catching up on over a decade of missed sleep. I've slept in as long as I've needed to, since August of 2019, & my husband has done the lions share of, ""getting kids ready for school,"" so I could begin the road to recovery from all this. 
However, I've been getting ""sick,"" w/cold or flu symptoms, once or twice a month since then. There's never anything wrong---no fever, nothing on a chest X-ray, no mononucleosis, no strep---no identifiable *reason* why I should be so vulnerable as my body is FINALLY getting the sleep it needs. 
During the Pandemic, I've developed a severe migraine issue that I now take Nortryptaline, 25 MG for. I've also had more extended periods of this random ""illness"" striking---it's lasting 2-3 days, and it's every 2-4 weeks. Right now, I have it again---body aches, headaches, cough, utter exhaustion. I've been asleep for 12 hours & need MORE. 

Quite honestly, I'm angry. I want my life back. What could be causing this? How do I fix it? What does ""exhaustion"" look like, medically? And now that I've finally beaten back so many of the demons that have plagued my family, how can I do the self-care necessary so I can enjoy it?

Of note, I did give birth to a healthy baby at 39 weeks in April of this year.

"Hi all,

TLDR: had third degree tears and shoulder dystocia first time. Am 5’4 , baby was not even huge. Have the option for a c section.

I need some outside perspective on this issue. I know each pregnancy and delivery is different and anything can happen. But I just want to few out the probability of what is better for me based on my previous experience.

I am pregnant for the second time and due date is end of May. My first pregnancy was kind of traumatic for me. I’m 5’4 and my baby was 3.4 kgs (not even in the 50th percentile). Labour was kind of painful but that wasn’t the issue. I needed, from three nurses, manual maneuvering when pushing baby out. It seemed that my pelvic area was not big enough - baby’s shoulders were stuck (shoulder dystocia). I ended up with third degree tears and after a week, abscess between vagina and anal area. That was drained after 40 days. Had mastitis and fever during that whole thing. Recovery was long and I cannot thing about it positively but now, I barely remember it. It’s now almost three years this May since my first pregnancy. This pregnancy, I noticed that whenever my husband and I had sex, my downstairs was clamp up painfully and I would need a day to feel normal again. I insisted on a generous amount of lubricant every time since then. I don’t know if it’s the hormones that are making the walls dry and more fibrous or what. I know tissue is not the same because of the the tears but I did not have this problem when we had sex before I got pregnant. So now I’m concerned how the tissue would stretch for the baby coming out if I’m having this issue with just sex. I been talking to my doctor about the possibility of having a c section for the past three, four meetings. I want to go for normal but I do not want an equivalent or a worse experience than what I had before. I also read that tears and infection after pregnancy can put you at risk for fistula which is a chronic and common issue (my doctor says that she hasn’t seen this issue in her two decades of experience but you never know...). She is being very diplomatic and not really helping in making my decision. She says that My pelvic area would be stretched out so even if this baby is big, I can push her out. She also said that because of my third degree tears, I would tear at a minimum...Pls help! I’m a little confused. I want a c section because I don’t want to end with a long recovery and double the scar and fibrous tissue down there and possibly chronic conditions. But then do need a c section? Ugh.

My main situation is that I'm planning to start a family, but to do so I need to come off most of my medications - I was advised on this at the hospital at the gynae clinic as well as monitoring with my GP. So far I have come off Gabapentin entirely (was 300mg 3 times daily) and have been going down by 50mg per week with tramadol.   I was taking both for 5 years or more for the chronic pain, the rise in pain coming off them is cery difficult but I am trying to cope so I have the best chance when ready to attempt pregnancy


I'm currently in the last stages of tramadol, only on 1-2 50mg pills over the day. I was on 8 per day across 4 doses. I'm trying to go down from 2 to 1, but I'm finding the withdrawal much much worse and on the verge of unbearable.


The worst part is the feeling in the stomach, ""pangs"", or like a dull fizzing sensation on the edge of being pain which grows worse until it is unbearable and I move which makes it better for 10-30 seconds before it gets awful again. As you can imagine this is making sleep impossible. The Trazodone I take is usually highly sedating at night to help me sleep but it took well over an hour more than usual last night, and that was after I had to give in and take the 2nd tramadol for the day and 2.5ml morphine because the pain was also unbearable.


I don't want to use much morphine at all, I use the bare minimum when my pain is unbearable to cope with in other ways (heat packs, rest, etc).


I'm so close to being off the tramadol, and have coped thus far with reducing, but it is getting almost impossible to take less than this because of how horrific the withdrawal feels. It is just worse than the withdrawal I've been coping with up to this point. I'd call my GP but they're not open again til Monday. I want to keep reducing, so I can start lowering the dose of Trazodone next (which I dread as it controls my mental health very well and has done for 6+ years, but I am focused on the bigger picture of having a family). 


If there's any advice on how to reduce these symptoms,  especially the feeling in the stomach and the feeling of being utterly uncomfortable in my own skin like it doesn't fit and is full of ants, I'd super appreciate it. It is horrible, and really hard to deal with on top of chronic pain which leaves me disabled even with the full painkillers I was on.",28.0,8.730017385812024,28.0,0.135,0.769,0.096,-0.9879,2837,0,1.4061035308821999,3.7800000000000002
"i apologize for the long post, but i’d like to start this off by giving a little background. on march 12th, i got a message from my doctor saying i tested positive for both ureaplasma and mycoplasma. both my boyfriend and i took 250 mg azithromycin for ten days and abstained from intercourse as directed. after the antibiotics were done, we continued as we usually did. 

june 16th, i went to my doctor appointment and was told they needed to retest me for mycoplasma and ureaplasma as they forgot to do it after i finished the antibiotics. they sent the wrong tube to the lab and had to redo it on july 1st. 

july 5th, i went to the hospital when i woke up with severe back pain. i normally woke up with moderate low back pain, and i’ve had back pain for years, so when it was so severe i wanted to cry, i knew something was up. i was admitted with a kidney infection that was thankfully caught early on. they did two rounds of iv antibiotics over the course of two days, as well as iv iron for severe anemia. i was also told i have hydronephrosis. i was sent home with a prescription for 325 mg ferrous sulfate and sulfamethoxazole that i take twice a day. 

july 10th, i get a text from my pharmacy saying they’re going to call my doctor regarding a new prescription that was sent in. i checked the app, and my normal doctors office had prescribed 150 mg clindamycin hcl with the directions to take three pills three times a day for a week. the pharmacy has still not filled this prescription, and i was also in the dark as to why it was prescribed. 

which brings me to yesterday, july 13th. i got a message from my doctor saying i’m still positive for the ureaplasma infection but not the mycoplasma. it explains so much: off smelling discharge, most likely the uti that led to my kidney infection, why i was prescribed more antibiotics on top of the ones i’m already taking. 

my main concern here is what has this done to my baby? i know as a pregnant woman that infections can do things to the baby when they are left untreated. i’m not very happy with my doctors because they “forgot” to retest for the infection and let it go for 4 months untreated. i’ve read that ureaplasma can cause uti’s but it’s not the most common way. i would also like to know if my baby is born with complications due to the infection, or if i had any complications during labor, if there’s any sort of legal action i can take. 

if you read all of this, thank you. i resort to this sub more often than i’d like to, but i have a lot of concerns as this is my first pregnancy. anything helps :)",40.0,7.907093507753068,40.0,0.073,0.842,0.085,0.4491,2593,1,0.8587225032349135,2.92
"This is about my daughter and myself. 
I (38m) am a military spouse and I use tricare. I am also a disabled vet and could use the VA, but have never enrolled in the VA health care system. My daughter is 2 and only has acess to tricare. 

We were contacted by the clinic on the base to inform us that we were high risk. This made sense because I have had a previous acute myocardial infarction and currently have hypertension. We also received a  call for my daughter, but her problems are far more extensive. She was born with an AV canal defect. She was in the hospital for a long time over this. She came home trached and vent dependent. She also came home with a GJ tube. Her list of previous and current ailments include 
- Necrotizing enterocolitis developed after birth due to bloodflow problems. She was not premature. Resolved after heart repair.
- bronchiotracheo Malaysia. Resolved with age and the tracheostomy has been removed. 
- laryngeal cleft, unresolved.
- pancreatitis- resolved after lipid treatment ceased for NEC
- She also had two serious bouts of pneumonia 

Now the confusing part. My wife has been working from home during the pandemic because of our high risk status. I have reduced my hours to stay home with the kids. I work alone so my my exposure risk is minimal. Last week her commander started requiring everyone who was not high risk nor had high risk family members to come back to work. No problem, we just contacted the clinic through the secure messaging service. The strange part is that our doctor replied that neither one of us was high risk, due to being young. This is the exact same clinic that called us out of the blue to warn us we were high risk.

 My wife was forced to start coming back. She is exposed to a large number of people daily. There is also a stigma around following CDC guidelines in the military, or at least at her base. 

My three specific questions are
- Should I enroll in and then go to the VA for a second opinion? 
- Should I cough up the money for my daughter to be seen by a private practitioner? 
- Do we seem high risk to you?",24.0,7.82963139877693,24.0,0.101,0.827,0.072,-0.8311,2116,3,1.4025829745868632,2.4240000000000004

"Background info: 27y, male, 175cm, 89kg, slightly overweight, no other chronic diseases that I know of (currently in investigation for possible Dysautonomia because of my constant high heart rate).


I've been extremely sedentary ever since the vírus started. I've been working from home ever since March, only going out for groceries and stuff. Just in these last 6 months, I've put on a significant amount of weight due to the sedentarism and eating a lot of junk food.

I can't get over the fear that my sedentarism and weight gain has caused a blood clot and that I could die at any moment. I have noticed that I get winded easily lately, it's not like ""omg, I can't breathe"". It feels more like a subtle air hunger, a very subtle ""suffocating"" feel whenever I do slight exertion or even at rest. My pulse ox shows my oxygen levels always between 96-98%. I've also counted my respiratory rate mostly between 12-15. Yet I can't get any piece of mind. I'm tired of feeling like I'm gonna die.

I've literally spent the last few days on a strong impulse of reading all about DVT/PE on some hopes of getting reassuring information, but it's only brought me more suffering. Every time I feel even slightly out of breath I instantly fear the worse. I'm too scared to go to the hospital because of the vírus, and my family has pretty much given up on me, basically written me off as some nutty hypochondriac, and every time I say I'm not feeling well they just say that it's my anxiety acting up, since I've gotten several cardiac exams during the last few years and nothing abnormal has shown up except for fast heart rate. 

As I type this post, I'm freaking out because my oxygen levels are at 96% instead of the usual 97-98%.

I spend pretty much the entire day sedentary, but I do get up to go to the bathroom, eat, shower, etc. I also try not to spend more than 3 hours lying down. I'll get up and stretch my legs a bit. Is that enough movement to avoid DVT's? I've read that most cases have some other underlylng causes like recent surgery, trauma, pregnancy, cancer, and long travels sitting in one position. None of those risk factors apply to me, yet I also read that just being sedentary at home could be a risk factor, and now I'm freaking out.

Would really like some insight regarding my worries. Thanks in advance!",15.0,8.509968919625663,15.0,0.137,0.77,0.093,-0.9713,2339,1,1.4729598967852922,2.055

Height: 5'0""

Weight: 190 lbs (working on losing weight currently)

Medications: Megestrol 40 mg, ibuprofen (prn), tylenol (prn), Omeprazole, Citirizine, Flonase

A little background:

I recently went through the medical ringer when I suddenly had a 29 day long, incredibly heavy period that would not stop no matter what.. Four months passed where I had 19 -29 day long periods that were incredibly heavy and painful while only having a short reprieve between. 

I was diagnosed with a uterine polyp, and went in for a D&C soon after that. 

After lab results came back, I was told that the polyp came back with complex, atypical hyperplasia with squamous morules.  There was no active cancer present, but precancerous cells definitely were. 

I was sent to see another doctor, and was put on Megestrol for the next three months to make sure all of the carnage is cleared out of my uterus. 

My two doctors seem to be giving me two different opinions on the matter, though.

One is telling me that I should forego trying to have children and have a hysterectomy in order to squash the chances of cancer developing. He said he's never seen a full, healthy pregnancy come from a person who came back with complex cells before. 

The other doctor seems confident that I can conceive (albeit probably with the help of a fertility specialist and medications), and carry a baby full term. 

I wanted to get some other opinions on the matter and see if there is a chance that I could conceive and carry a healthy baby to birth, or is it not worth the risk?

There have been studies showing that covid during pregnancy leads to increase risk of death, premature birth, miscarriage, and the list goes on. After reading about this, my SO and I (currently 25w0d) decided to be a lot more vigilant on leaving the house (only for groceries and pick up when possible) and who we saw (only other people who didnt go out). However, this means I don't get to see most of my family since they work jobs where they have to interact with people. For Thanksgiving, I didn't get to see my family and that was fine, but with Christmas coming up it is getting hard for me to stick with our plan of not interacting with our loved ones because I really miss them.

"Hey lovelies. 

I recently discovered that I am expecting my first baby, although because I don't have periods I have no idea how far along I am.

I took a clear blue test which indicated conception to be 2-3 weeks ago, but I've already got swollen breasts, a visible bump and I'm urinating all the time. Also I'm slightly constipated 🥴 

When I called my doctor's surgery (University Doctors surgery) to make them aware of the pregnancy the receptionist said I would have a phonecall appointment on the 23rd of September (not an ultrasound). Is this normal? If I am already tender and showing I could be over 12 weeks by the time I have that phonecall...

Furthermore, I told the receptionist that I'd been experiencing sharp stabbing pains in my lower right side over the previous month. She didn't ask me anymore about the pains and just said if they got worse I should go to the walk-in centre.

Adding to all this: my doctor's surgery doesn't *deal* with pregnancies because they are a university surgery. This means I have to attend a sister centre somewhere else in the city and I have no midwife or doctor set up. 

The last 2 nights I've woken up in the night gasping for breath and panicking. I'm *hoping* (for lack of a better word) that this is a combination of stress and anxiety and exhaustion from working. But I'm also terrified it might be something else to worry about.

I already love this baby deeply, but the thought that I could have harmed him, along with the fear of judgement should he be born with distinctive facial features of FAS has me absolutely wrecked.

"Hi there! Hoping for some help in making a decision regarding my infant daughter who has been diagnosed with anisocoria. It was noticed by her pediatrician during her six month vaccines, and we were referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist. The doc confirmed the pupil sizes are different; the right one is smaller. She noted that either she was born with it, or it could be Horner’s syndrome. Of course the worry with Horner’s is that it could be a tumor causing the pressure on the eye. We reviewed previous pictures of her, and noted we could see the difference in her pupil size from at least one month old onward. There are no other noticeable symptoms of Horner’s syndrome at this time. 

The doctor has presented two choices to us - either wait and watch, or conduct a test to rule out Horner’s. The test would be using  an eye drop called Apraclonidine, which is not indicated for children. The concern is that it can cause excessive sleepiness, slow breathing and even cause infants to stop breathing.

"37yr female. 136lbs 5ft3in resides in US , history of IBS , recurrent miscarriage after 12 weeks (2), prolapsed bladder  otherwise healthy. 

Hopefully someone is awake and can help! Its late soo my doctor is currently unavailable. Im 11 weeks pregnant and did have a ultrasound last weeks showing a viable pregnancy with a 165 hr and measuring right on time.  I developed a prolapsed bladder with my last delivery (birthed a 9lb 5oz baby) but its mild and has not caused any issues.  Until now. 

I have been experiencing periodic difficulties in urination during the night with last night being the worst ... spent an hour and half in the bathroom trying to release urine with not even a drop .. strained,  tried different positions,  took a bath , nothing would work until finally I strained one more time and it finally gave way. During this time i was experiencing quite alot of pain from a full bladder. 

Today while in the shower I felt more heaviness in my vaginal area then usual,  preceeded to check with my hand and felt a buldge then felt the (closed) opening of my cervix right at the opening of my vagina.  

My questions are ;  how long is too long to have a full bladder that is unable to be emptied? Due to my pelvic floor difficulties the next time this happens should I avoid straining at all and go straight to emergency?   Will my cervix being at the opening put me on dreaded bed rest? And last ... I babysit a 8 month old who is about 25 lbs ... should I stop ?  

Thanks in advance your help! I also did already email my doctor but won't hear anything until tomorrow sometime.

"Hello everyone, 

for the past 2 months or so I have been experiencing a few things in relation to my jaw which I suspect has to do with my wisdom teeth(Im male, 19). very occasionally my wisdom teeth have been painful only when i push my tongue down on them. What is more worrisome is that I think my TMJ joint on the left side of my jaw ""locks up"". Its almost like theres friction between my jaw bone and my skull which prevents my jaw from fully extending/opening. My uneducated guess is that my growing jaw and wisdom teeth are creating tension on my jaw bone somehow. 

&#x200B;

Ive also experienced muffled hearing in both ears today which prompted me to write this post. I dont know if the muffled hearing is related to my jaw and/or wisdom teeth problem but ive heard of many instances where wisdom teeth that are long overdue to be removed can cause infections that sometimes are in the ear cavities.

&#x200B;

Should I just see a dentist for something like this? or is there a more specific type of doctor I should see? hopefully I explained enough to answer my question.

"This is about my 7 year old son. (White, a little over 50th percentile for height, BMI around 50th percentile; 37 weeks gestation, no known anoxic injuries at birth, has met milestones on time). He has had PE tubes places three times, and is slightly far sighted. 


He had a non-fatal drowning about a year ago, he did not need to be resuscitated. No significant head injuries. Otherwise completely unremarkable history. Brother has hypotonic CP.  Family history of Lewy Body dementia and Parkinson’s. 


As long has he has been able to talk, my son has had difficulty with word retrieval. He used circumlocution from a very early age. I thought it was cute, I’ve never heard a 3-year-old describe a banana for 5 minutes because they can’t remember the word “banana.”  He would describe what you do with it, where we keep it in the house, and where to find it in the grocery store.  When he can’t remember “ball,” it’s “the thing the Red Sox throw.”


We just started online school and part of online school in first grade to demonstrate understanding is sorting pictures or putting them in order and then recording yourself explaining. The problem is, he can’t name the pictures.  When that happened I called my pediatrician and he send me SLP resources to help address aphasia. 


My question is: what causes aphasia?  Should we see a neurologist for formal testing?

As for her arm she says her right arm is not as responsive or strong as it use to be, like her handwriting is very off than before and has to exert/try harder to write. Also says arm sometimes loses strength when doing tasks like in the kitchen.

She also had an appt in June for joint/pain specialist that diagnosis her with the knee arthritis and the DO did some steroid injection to the knee, could this be a sequela from the medication/treatment?

I worry she might have some serious underlying condition like early onset dementia or have serious risk of stroke, just worry its something very major and not caught early enough in time.

What should we do? should we see a specialist or run some sorts of test? Any Medical Advice would be great

"Hi! I'm 37F, light smoker (as of 6 months ago) in Australia. In December 2018, my daughter was born and since she was about 2 months old, I have been in pain to varying degrees. During my pregnancy I put on 35kg and have lost 6 of that but losing weight has been incredibly difficult because I'm severely limited by my pain. My daughter's birth was uncomplicated and I have suffered no injuries, traumas, car accidents in the last 20 months with the exception of a nasty Red Back spider bite in January 2019. 

It's probably important to note that it is nerve pain,  definitely not muscular, and it moves around my body constantly. Most mornings, I am unable to make a fist and I can't walk properly because my feet hurt which gives way to a burning sensation which comes and goes throughout the day. I get sudden stabbing pains in the back of my head which disappear as fast as they come on. Some days, my middle and ring finger on my right hand will be totally immobilised because of the pain which will shoot up my forearm to my elbow. Some days I can barely lift my coffee cup. Some days it's sciatica and my legs are too weak to carry me up and down the stairs and on other days it's in my lower back. The pain is everywhere and nowhere and I never know where it will be on any given day.

Most days, my pain rates at about a 3 or 4 but some days it will get to a 7 or 8. Those are the days I've had to take time off work and they are increasing.

I've been to four doctors who've all told me there's nothing wrong with me. I've had blood tests (negative for thyroid issues and arthritis) x-rays (showed straightening of my neck which I've had for years) and an MRI on my lumbar spine which came back clean. 

One dr gave me Naprosyn (doesn't work) one gave me Lyrica (made me depressed) and one tells me that paracetamol and ibuprofen should be enough (they aren't). I'm currently not taking anything.

Other symptoms which I'm noticing include: involuntary slurring speech, inability to remember words, comprehension problems (I've always been excellent with spelling and grammar), feeling dizzy when driving at night, tinnitus, fatigue, zero libido (not even some, just none), hair loss and an inability to feel full when I eat.

I'm not crazy, I'm in pain. I don't want meds, I want an answer. I can't live like this - I am miserable. Up until 6 weeks ago I was drinking quite heavily to numb the pain enough to sleep but since I've given up drinking it's only increased the pain. What is this? What could it be?

I asked my mom/ family if i snore and they all say I don’t, that at most it’s heavy breathing (maybe it’s to protect my feelings). When I went to college my freshman roommate made my life miserable because of my snoring, i started sleeping under the bed and waiting for everyone to sleep before i slept and tried waking up early before everyone else. it got to the point i couldn’t take it anymore so i downloaded apps that help tract snoring, the recordings sounded more like labored breathing than the typical snore, but the typical snore happened occasionally too but not often. It also occurred in spirts, like a cycle. Also when I was younger my doctor said i had large tonsils not sure of that matters but my mom says it’s a possible factor.

I have no children but I would like them in the future. I don’t want to get pregnancy right now as it’s not convenient (about to start my masters) so would like to go on birth control. I do have some issues that I am worried about it being made worse or in general. 

Gynaecological issues:

My menstruation varies month to month; some months I have painful cramps and little bleeding, other months I have heavier bleeding and little cramping, other months I have extremely painful cramps, fever, shivers, nausea, can’t get out of bed and heavier bleeding. PMS varies month to month also. I have had my hormones checked and have had multiple ultrasounds done. In the past my ovaries have been described as “polycystic looking” and the more recently the ultrasound technician said she thinks I could possibly have endometriosis, but if I do the growth is very mild as it’s not showing up on the ultrasound. 

My vaginal pH is unbalanced really easily. My boyfriend can’t come inside me because I will get BV. I get recurrent thrush infections which I treat with boric acid or clotrimazole if they get really bad. I also feel like my pelvic floor is very weak as my boyfriend can’t feel me when I kegel on him. (I’ve just started doing kegels to combat this) 

On top of this, I feel as if my vagina is quite dry and I have trouble orgasming. Sex can be painful as lubrication can be an issue (posterior fourchette sometimes has little tears) and my cervix stays very low (not sure why this is happening as never used to be a problem in the past, could be due to recent anxiety around sex? Sometimes even my mouth gets dry during sex). 

Mental health issues:

I am worried about my mental health being affected. I have bad anxiety and depression. Both are (sort of) stable for the first time in years and I don’t want to go into another deep psychotic depression and not be able to come out of it. As I’m currently unemployed due to corona and am living at home with people that I have very little daily contact with. 

I would like to go on the pill as I do not want to get pregnant right now and I was thinking that these issues could be hormonal and that going in birth control would help but at the same time I am worried about going on it if my mental health becoming unstable or exacerbating my gynaecological issues if I go on birth control.

"Hi

I am a 23 year old male.

Yes, the title says it all. I have and had it all.
I've been together with my girlfriend for 2 years now. Before her I was a virgin. In the beginning of our relationship I had ED. I went to my doctor and he gave me some viagra pills and I also quit porn. This helped a little bit, my ED is mostly gone. I don't take these pills anymore obviously.

Now after that, I started getting premature ejaculation. I cannot last over 10 strokes PIV or I will come. I've tried almost everything. Kegels, reverse kegels, SSRIs, start-stop, edging, meditation,... Nothing helps. After 2 years now, I am hopeless...

Now something else that may be very important information for you guys:
I've also had problems with peeing for a long time. Way before I had my girlfriend. I almost cannot pee when I'm standing, it will take a long time even when I'm sitting. I really have to focus... I don't understand...

This all is getting very annoying. Not only the PE but also peeing.

Thank you in advance for your guidance and help.",22.0,6.671804679900946,22.0,0.037,0.913,0.05,0.5801,1056,0,0.739852029594081,0.814
"Hey guys, so this weird thing has been happening for a couple of years now & I seriously have no clue what the issue could be. My only guess is some sort of nerve problem. 
Anytime I lay down onto my stomach, my legs immediately fall asleep. It’s a pinchy, static feeling for the first few seconds then they both fall asleep. Also as of very recently (like last 2 months), sometimes when I lay flat on my back my arms will fall asleep. This has happened about 4 times. 

Just some info about me: I’m 22, female, white, 5’5, 145lbs, extremely active (I’m a circus coach & workout 6 days a week), & I’m pretty slim/muscular in size, definitely not overweight. Also no family history of anything like this. Only current medication is cy-red (birth control pill). I’ve been on the pill consistently for 10 years now. I’ve been formally diagnosed with anxiety, IBS, restless leg syndrome, & PACs (premature atrial contractions). I don’t smoke, drink, or do any other sorts of drugs.

"Hey everyone! 

Basically, my period is 5 days late, which doesn't normally happen to me. My cycles are regural, usually in the 26-28 days range. I'm on day 33 today and for the past 2 weeks, I've been experiencing what I first thought was PMS, but could very well be early pregnancy symptoms: mild cramps, pain in both sides of my abdomen, headache, backache, fatigue, mild nausea and sensitivity. 

I also have symptoms of both uti (burning sensetion when going to the toilet) and possibly a yeast infection (itching and discharge).

Important info: I'm not on birth control and haven't been in almost a year. I've had sex once in the past month, sometime around my (expected) ovulation, used a condom that to my knowledge didn't break. 

I've taken 3 pregnancy tests so far: on day 30, 31 and again today (day 33). All taken in the morning, all negative. I'm planning on taking another one on Monday (day 35, week after my missed period) and if it comes back negative, I'm gonna call my doctor for a blood test.

Till then, I wanted to ask whether my symptoms could be a sign of something else other than pregnancy, or whether it is possible that I am pregnant even though all the tests came back negative so far.

"28 female. 5' 3"" ~110 lbs. Depression, cPTSD (unrelated to this.) Zoloft. This might be a long shot but I am not sure what to do. I just really hope someone can help me.
I had my daughter 8 months ago, it was a traumatic birth. She was very large and got stuck. 
I started out with a whole bunch of medical problems that I was discharged from the hospital with and then I had to return to the ER to get treated for sepsis, severe anemia from hemorrhaging, pneumonia, and secondary heart failure. 
I lost feeling in my right ring finger after the birth. I had shortness of breath and back pain, I couldn't walk right due to pain in my lower back, groin and legs. The numbness in my ring finger gradually spread to three fingers on my right hand. I frequently catch my nails on things and break them but it doesn't hurt as much as it should. 
The front of my pelvis was opened and I had soft tissue damage which has healed up and I can walk mostly now without pain except in my tailbone. 
My tailbone sticks out now and feels crooked. I can't seem to get a doctor to look at it or take it seriously. 
I also have a rib that hurts when I move, touch it, breathe or do anything really but I've just adjusted to living with it until today when it got worse. I've gone to the doctor numerous times to no avail. 
Today, I asked my fiance to rub my back and he put gentle pressure on the opposite side of the bad rib and I felt a pop and then I had severe pain, I took more medication and laid down. As I laid down the numbness started setting in in my feet and when I woke up from my nap it went from my right foot all the way up my neck. 
I went to the ER and they were dismissive and told me it's a repetitive strain injury. They wouldn't even acknowledge the numbness on half my body because I'm young (28) and my vitals were good aside from increased heart rate. The doctor waved his arms around and said ""it's some kind of a mechanical thing.""
The pain in my rib is excruciating now. As always it wraps from the back all the way to the front. Half my back is swollen and the muscles are sticking out well past the other side. My coccyx keeps snapping, clicking and paining. My neck is stiff and I feel pressure in my head. 
The numbness isn't really bad but its noticable, when I pinch my skin on my right side it feels less sharp than my left. A tack feels more like pressure than a point until firm pressure is applied.
Can anyone give me any advice or a direction of where to go? I am desperate and willing try anything at this point. Can a chiropractor help me?
I do light stretching and exercising, I breastfeed my daughter so all I can take is tylenol and ibuprofen which may as well be placebos at this point.

"This first happened in march. I'd wake up in the early am in incredible lower pelvic pain, near-constant (not the rolling waves of cramps). For about a week this persisted, and I'd have to down iburpofen at 6am and lay curled up until it kicked in. Wennt to gyno, they did an exam and tests. No STD/yeast/bacteria. All good. No UTI. I asked for antibiotics anyways because I had a terrible UTI a few months prior (first one ever) and as a kid I had ""stealth UTIs"" and one got into my kidneys and I nearly died. Dr. did not believe it was anything, but I kept fighting her that this is not normal for me. She then suggested that it could be a cyst, but they don't like to do anything about them and I *could* get an ultrasound but at a different office 30 minutes away. At the time, the pandemic shutdown was in full force so it was hard to get in anywhere, and I didn't have a car. So I didn't pursue it further.

It went away after the antibiotics and Advil. Never thought of it again, until yesterday.

I woke up at 4am yesterday with the same incredible pain in my very low pelvis/pubic region. Took ibuprofen and water and laid there in pain until they kicked in - I can actually feel the moment they kick in because it's like the pain whooshes away. Went back to sleep, thought maybe it's an ovulation thing? Slight ache in left ovary during day, nothing else. Went to bed last night tossing and turning, feeling super hot an uncomfortable. Woke up at 7 in EXTREME pain, went pee (no burning or difficulty) and then took some Tylenol and one ibuprofen (since I hadn't eaten I wanted to be careful). I was writhing around in bed, it was so bad. It's like I'd imagine early labor, but without the relief of the gap between contractions. No position didn't hurt, I was exhausted but also wanting to vomit from the pain. \~20 later the meds kicked in and I was able to get back to sleep and feel comfortable, and now at 3pm it's still all good (just a dull sense of discomfort and bloating). I'm very fatigued, though, and almost feel like I have a cold physically (tested negative for covid last week).

What. the. fuck?

During my actual ""period"" I have very little cramping, and it only lasts around 4 days and is very light.

I plan on getting an app ASAP for this and having them do a more thorough check. Could it be a cyst rupturing? Last pain was on my right ovary, this time it's the left. Could it be ovulation pain?I've been on birth control for 9 years, 2 of which have been with Nexplanon (so no estrogen). Period is every \~50 days. My boobs have been SUPER painful to touch the last week as well. No diet changes, no sex (thnx covid) in like 10 months, since way before my last doctor visit.

TLDR; 23 yr old female, not sexually active this year, on birth control; random sporadic *severe* pain in lower pubic region in early mornings (1 week in march, and now in September). Cyst? Ovulation? Uterus trying to rip itself out to leave the US?

"I'm neither pregnant nor a smoker but a debate got going amongst a group I'm part of. Many people claimed their doctor advised they simply cut back smoking claiming that the stress of quitting smoking would be more harmful to their baby. I couldn't find any evidence to back that statement up and it sounds like rubbish. So I thought I'd ask reddit's doctors what they thought of that statement. Someone even claimed 5 or 5 cigarettes is completely safe for a pregnant woman and won't cause her baby any harm. I find that hard to believe.

In short, I've been seeing the same GP since I was 6 years old. I was adopted and raised in Canada from Bulgaria. Despite many trips to the hospital for Bloodwork, Fainting, Low-Vision, and Sleep-Trouble (among others), my GP has assured my family that ""everything came back normal"" and insisted no specialist (endochrinologist etc) was needed and that her prescriptions are all I need. 
I've been getting gradually worse, and have decided to take my medical records for a review, and seek a second opinion from another doctor. Am I jumping the gun and being too harsh on my GP by abandoning her? Are my labs ""perfect"" and ""it's all in my head?""
**Am I just ""*complaining too much?*""**
I've added a few of the labs that were highlighted on my (large) file, and I would very much appreciate any insight as to whether the readings are indeed within the ""normal, fine"" range - or if I am just being a hypochondriac. 

Much appreciated!

My apologies if my post is so long, but this really is as brief but detailed I could make my medical history. I have attached a couple of the labs that I believe warrant a review as they may not be *""normal""*. Or, their could be an explanation for my symptoms within the normal variables - in which case, I don't want to jump the gun and leave my doctor.

Either way, I feel like I am 65 when I should be at the time of my life. I don't understand the purpose of so many tests if they are all returned ""normal"" and my GP says to keep my med regimen simply. When I complain, I sometimes get accused of being ""moody"" or ""manic"" or not taking my medication.

I am concerned about the risks associated with an SCH. 

I have two acquaintances who have a SCH and both experienced pPROM at 23 weeks. Both are hospitalized indefinitely hoping to stay pregnant as long as possible.

For obvious reasons I am concerned this will also happen to me.

The thing is, I don’t want to go to the hospital for weeks. If my water breaks very early, it seems I should let go of hope for the life I’m carrying. 

Is this something that I may have a choice about? Or will they force me to be hospitalized? 

I have a daughter and my husband works. No one could watch her if I am stuck in the hospital. Plus a really early delivery could mean profound disabilities for the child.

I was born at 24 weeks gestation at a very low birth weight of only 1 pound and 8 ounces, and spent 3 months in the NICU where I experienced complications of:

-	Tension Pneumothorax due to perforating my lung while intubated in the NICU. Apparently I also accidentally pulled out my own NG tube too. Yay me! 
-	Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC).
-	Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), probably exasperated by the disseminated intravascular coagulation.
-	A colostomy, had a stoma bag for 6 months until the DIC and NEC got better and my colon could be anastomosed. Good thing I don't remember any of it.
-	Had my bowel resectioned because of the necrotizing enterocolitis. I have a massive scar above my belly button that goes from one side of my stomach to the other.
-	A hole in my heart that later closed. Thank goodness.

Currently as an adult, I still have: 

-	Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) due to 100% oxygen toxicity. I am visually impaired. Doctors tried using scaleral buckles and laser surgery on both eyes when I was born to try and save my retina from detaching but things didn't turn out well. I'm completely blind in my left eye and have 20/100 vision in my right eye. The left eye has a cataract and calcium build up but it's been stable for years and my pediatric ophthalmologist thinks there's no point in risking things and doing surgery to remove it if I can't see out of the eye anyway.
-	Very minor cerebral palsy, caused by intracranial bleeding due to the DIC. I received occupational and physical therapy when I was a young child but I don't remember much of it.
-	Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). I don't experience any symptoms of it at all except for frequent nose bleeds. They're not too bad now that I'm older, but when I was in elementary school, my nose could easily bleed for 30-60 minutes or more. My record is a bloody nose in kindergarten that lasted over two hours because a stray kickball came flying out of nowhere during recess and hit me right on my nose.

-	Tension Pneumothorax due to perforating my lung while intubated in the NICU. Apparently I also accidentally pulled out my own NG tube too. Yay me! 
-	Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC).
-	Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), probably exasperated by the disseminated intravascular coagulation.
-	A colostomy, had a stoma bag for 6 months until the DIC and NEC got better and my colon could be anastomosed. Good thing I don't remember any of it.
-	Had my bowel resectioned because of the necrotizing enterocolitis. I have a massive scar above my belly button that goes from one side of my stomach to the other.
-	A hole in my heart that later closed. Thank goodness.

Currently as an adult, I still have: 

-	Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) due to 100% oxygen toxicity. I am visually impaired. Doctors tried using scaleral buckles and laser surgery on both eyes when I was born to try and save my retina from detaching but things didn't turn out well. I'm completely blind in my left eye and have 20/100 vision in my right eye. The left eye has a cataract and calcium build up but it's been stable for years and my pediatric ophthalmologist thinks there's no point in risking things and doing surgery to remove it if I can't see out of the eye anyway.
-	Very minor cerebral palsy, caused by intracranial bleeding due to the DIC. I received occupational and physical therapy when I was a young child but I don't remember much of it.
-	Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). I don't experience any symptoms of it at all except for frequent nose bleeds. They're not too bad now that I'm older, but when I was in elementary school, my nose could easily bleed for 30-60 minutes or more. My record is a bloody nose in kindergarten that lasted over two hours because a stray kickball came flying out of nowhere during recess and hit me right on my nose. 
-	I have the Hemoglobin E Thalassemia Minor trait. Thanks, mom and dad.
-	Tachycardia. Resting heart rate of 110+ BPM.

"19M, 262 lb., 5' 11.75"", Latino, ditched marijuana 2 weeks ago and former nicotine addict as of 6 months ago, and I don't drink.

I stopped vaping wax just 2 weeks ago and I have noticed lately that I've been having a much more difficult time holding in so much physical and mental stress even after the withdrawals have pretty much gone away a week ago.

A little story: Last Monday, I woke up feeling ready to walk to my job which is at a Home Improvement Store and I finally get there and feel physically fine. About half an hour into my shift, I've noticed I've started to feel mt legs less and less, yet I'm still walking, but slowly to be cautious. This immediately effects my performance and cause me to walk slower. Another half an hour goes by and I begin feeling a minor headache along with the slowly weakening, however it isnt severe. I take a 15 minute break to grab a honey bun and some water because I thought I just needed sugar tk wake me up. Afterwards, I give it another half an hour, and now I'm depending on a shopping cart to keep me standing and taking deep breaths to make sure I don't drop right there on the floor. I drink more cold water for 15 minutes and realize it's not getting any better, so I called my Assistant Manager and let him know I had to leave early. I get a ride from my grandfather and get home and sit in my room for a little longer until I can get up and at least shower and wipe down the surfaces in the bathroom. I do that, and just put on my underwear and fall asleep with the dehumidifier on so I could cool down. I wake up 3 hours later sweating anyways and I go through the next couple days with this headache. I start to feel better 2 days later, but I took the second day off to prevent having to call sick from over-exerting myself too soon.

Yesterday, I return to work and make it through the shift just fine, except I've had to stop a couple times more than usual to drink water. Since 2 days ago, I have noticed that with physical labor, I end up feeling my heart beating way harder than usual. This continues in waves throughout the day. I've even woken up this morning drenching the bed and the sheets in sweat because of my heartbeat. I feel like maybe part of the problem might be anxiety, especially since I no longer smoke, even though I haven't thought about relapsing at all this week.

I should also mention that along with the rough and fast heart rate (I never measured it but felt it change so much), I've been exhausted to the point I almost feel like I'm a little Intoxicated, which has never happened for more than 2 hours in a day until this week. As I am typing this my brain is starting to ache a little. Can anyone tell me if these harsh heartbeats are considered Heart Palpitations, if not anything else?

"I’m (F28) 7 weeks into my second pregnancy and I am absolutely mortified with the idea of giving birth again.

My first pregnancy was unplanned, I spent those 9 months with crippling anxiety. Although my birth was easy and fast, I have not been able to shake off the trauma it caused me. I think I have PTSD, I can’t even think about the experience without becoming light headed and passing out. I’m a big time WUSS, so please don’t compare yourself to me. 

I had an induction (HATED IT, lost control of my contractions), and also an epidural (getting the epidural was traumatic, I felt a spine cracking sensation, It was so uncomfortable). I labored for 4 hours and pushed my son out in 10 minutes. Never again I said. 

Except it’s been 19 months since my son was born and I am now pregnant again (unplanned). It’s taken me 3 weeks to cope, I can finally say im excited. But I cannot shake the absolute fear of giving birth. I can’t even think about it without going into a panic attack.

"Age 30, 30 weeks pregnant, white, normal BMI, taking prenatal and iron supplement, mild gestational diabetes 

Here’s the timeline of illness:

Friday night: heartburn/acid reflux when lying down which turned into me throwing up everything I ate that day. Assumed I ate something bad. I’ve had acid reflux this whole pregnancy so nothing new. 

Saturday: still felt a little weird from last night but felt better over the course of the day. Then felt nauseous again come nighttime. Again as soon as I go to bed I start regurgitating then vomiting everything. 

Sunday: wake up feeling uninterested in food but not nauseous. Lots of burping/reflux stuff. Start having watery diarrhea that subsides in the afternoon but then returns at night. Didn’t throw up that night. 

Monday: generally feeling shitty but no nausea. Lots of burping. Still diarrhea but it comes and goes. 

Tuesday: feel totally fine. Normal appetite, no diarrhea. Back to my old self. 

I have no idea what this was and I’m worried it could have been dangerous or contagious to my husband or baby. I never even ran a low grade fever, so my doctor suggested it was a sensitivity to my iron supplements, which I stopped taking on Sunday. Recovery happened really suddenly. I’m very worried it could have been covid,  but my husband is in the house 24/7 and the last time I left the house was to see my OB, where I wore full PPE including goggles and N95.

"A family member (35 yo F) has been having issues with unexplained hypoglycemia.  Currently 4 months postpartum.  During pregnancy was diagnosed as gestational diabetic (the most compliant diabetic you've ever seen).  She threw a nasty superior messenteric venous thrombus almost immediately after delivery which was fun and led us to the heterozygous Leiden diagnosis. She is back to her pre pregnancy weight (or darn close) at 125 lbs.

About a month ago she starts having bouts of hypoglycemia that occur late morning or early afternoon and happen almost every day.  We tried dietary changes with no results.

"Hi everyone! Hoping to get some much needed insight...

I am a 29 year old female in Toronto, Canada with the condition Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH).  I suffer from debilitating headaches and I've got papillidema from the increased pressure. I've had multiple lumbar punctures in the past-  all leading to CSF leaks, low pressure headaches and blood patches. Needless to say I am very apprehensive to have anything go near my spinal cord due to the physical and emotional trauma caused.

I have been avoiding the idea of pregnancy for a long time as I know that it could potentially increase my symptoms and lead to further damage to my optic nerves and thus vision loss. Most of my symptoms are currently made worse by hormonal changes around my period so I'm worried about how pregnancy hormones will affect my pregnancy. 

With all this said, I am getting to the point where I desperately want to have a child with my partner and it is a life change that is very imminent. My concerns now mainly lie with the actual delivery process.

My main question is: given my health condition, am I allowed to request a cesarean section under general anesthesia? I absolutely do not feel comfortable with an epidural or spinal block and absolutely do not feel comfortable with a vaginal delivery as CSF pressure raises with pushing. 

I am terrified and apprehensive to get pregnant unless I know that my preferred method of delivery/anesthesia will be honored. I don't want to put myself more at risk.

Hi I was prescribed 5mg Melatonin to take ""as needed"" before bed, and after night 1 of taking it, I experienced extreme daytime sleepiness and felt very groggy. I continued to take the Melatonin every night, since I'm in the final stages of submitting my PhD and I generally struggle to sleep. After about 7 nights of taking it, I started feeling extra depressed, groggy and started explaining to people that I have ""flu brain"" or ""foggy brain"", attributing my issues speaking, reading, and even writing to possibly developing a bad case of the flu, or just my general unusually high stress levels. However, at day 8, I noticed (by some grace) that while I thought I was typing full sentences/phrases, I actually only typed one word or two words, hence leaving out words but still believing I typed the whole sentence. I could barely remember what my PhD study was about, I couldn't read without stumbling or struggling to pronounce words, and I had very bad short term memory. I informed my partner, but we attributed it to stress. By day 10, I needed my partner's help to write basic sentences and had severe short term memory issues and trouble speaking. I tried filling out a form for my partner, since I have a neat handwriting, but it was a struggle. I decided to not take the melatonin last night, and woke up feeling refreshed and ""normal"" again. However, my partner brought me the form I filled out the previous day, and said he now completely believes me on the issues I was describing concerning my writing difficulties. I looked at the form but could see nothing wrong, until he pointed out that I had left out i.e. the middle parts of words, etc. For instance, we live in Waterberry Street, but I wrote Waterry Street.
I have never taken melatonin before. 
I have been on the following prescribed medicine: Anxiolytics (0.5mg Azor) and antidepressants (50mg Serdep) as well as birth control meds (Zoely) long term.

(Not sure if that’s relevant, but I don’t want to leave out any potentially important info.)

For the past 3 weeks (starting a week before I got a positive test), I’ve been having super intense cramping sensations on the lower right side of my abdomen (halfway between my bellybutton and right hipbone). At first I thought I was just about to start a rough period, but that obviously wasn’t the case. It got a bit better for a few days, but it came back today much worse than before. It especially hurts when I’m lying down on my left side or when anything touches my stomach even slightly. 

My abdomen and breasts are very tender and my morning sickness is already starting to kick in, but I haven’t experienced this kind of abdominal pain in either of my other pregnancies. It’s keeping me up tonight because it hurts too bad to fall asleep. 

Is this normal during early pregnancy, or is this a cause for concern?",1.0,8.156783731159267,1.0,0.124,0.81,0.066,-0.9647,1648,1,1.8785032570822602,0.124
"Hey there. I’m 27F, 50kg, 5’6, white. I’m currently on 100mg of sertraline. These symptoms could all be related or not at all. Sorry for the length, this has all been going on for a while and I’m starting to wonder if it’s linked. 

My problems started a few months after my son was born, he’s now 17 months old, so it has been going on for more than a year. Pre-pregnancy I was around 60kg, during pregnancy at my heaviest I was close to 70kg, and I have now been hovering around 50kg for about 8 months. I’m classed as underweight for my height and my clothes are loose. No changes in my diet that would explain the weight loss. 

I started having IBS symptoms when I started losing weight and I have loose bowels every day which is often accompanied by feelings of being very hot, sick, and tachycardia. 

I chalked up my fatigue to having a new baby but it has never subsided even though he’s been sleeping through the night for about six months now. Recent bloodwork showed that I have low iron despite the fact I’ve been taking an iron supplement for months. 

I suddenly developed unilateral tinnitus in February and it never went away (I have it right now as I’m typing). 

Ten days ago I noticed non-blanching purple spots on my left thigh (but no other acute symptoms apart from a bit of a headache) and I was advised to attend A&E which I did. I was given IV antibiotics and fluids but the bloodwork showed nothing so they let me go. I can still faintly see the rash. Today I developed petechiae in two more areas, again on my left thigh. There has been no trauma to the area or anything I can think of that would cause this. 

I noticed that my legs always seem to be covered in bruises and I never understand where they have come from. I saw my GP about all the issues above (apart from the most recent petechiae) and they couldn’t find anything wrong. 

Any thoughts as to what the heck is going on? Thank you.

So my life has been really stressful lately and I've had this lip issue for the past several months it just feels and looks inflamed.

I *(much ashamed of this)* more than often forget to brush my teeth at night because I am EXHAUSTED due to work (I am a delivery driver), which is what I'm guessing is contributing this lip condition. I am also on the road a lot so it's very difficult to find healthy things to eat on the job. I eat a very healthy overnight oatmeal in the morning \[organic rolled oats, Oatly Oatmilk, Organic Chia seeds, cinnamon, honey, yogurt, blueberries, mangoes, strawberries\]) but often find myself feeling hungry again during lunch time and resorting to high sodium jerky, chips, and tacos. Are there any lunches I can meal prep for myself that'll get that **\*tasty\*** craving I always crave and is healthy at the same time?

Will simply eating a better diet and brushing & flossing my teeth every night from this forth on fix my problem over time? Has anyone experienced this lip problem before? 

I also believe a Gastroenterologist diagnosed me with Irritable Bowel Syndrome around 8 months ago? Is the inflammation on my lips correlated with my gut health? I always feel discomfort in my intestinal areas and more than often go through diarrhea and I don't know why. I also suffer from pencil stools sometimes :( (but sometimes my poops are extremely light brown and healthy \[on days that I am not stressed\])

I feel so embarrassed walking around like this >\_< \[extremely thankful it's face mask season\]  
I could really use some opinions and support :'|

"I (22F) have been experiencing extreme bursts of stomach pain for the last two months. The pain presents directly in the center of my abdomen, above my belly button and below the end of my sternum. When pain occurs it lasts for specifically 4-6 hours, never less and never more. It’s hard to describe the pain precisely, but it’s a fiery ache that brings me to the floor, I usually resort to laying in the fetal position for the entire duration of pain but no position makes the pain better or worse. Sometimes I experience nausea and sometimes I don’t, my stomach does usually distended from bloating, but never usually accompanied by diarrhea. Interestingly I do find that my thinking gets foggy during these attacks, causing me to feel a bit loopy. This pain started out occurring every few days, but it now occurs daily, at completely random times. Food and drink do not worsen or help the pain! 

I started seeing a GI, and she gave me the works. I had a completely clear abdominal ultrasound which ruled out gallstones. Lots of blood work revealed that I have an unusual blood count- I have a 1% count of premature white blood cells. Tested negative for celiac disease. Just two days ago I had an EGD, biopsy results are not in yet. But we know there surprisingly is NO peptic ulcer, stomach and duodenum where completely clear. 
There was however variant mucosa present in my distal esophagus. (Link to photo below). My GI believes it is simply healed scarring from previous acid reflux. 

After all this I feel like there is no definite answer for the extreme pain. I am in dire need of some relief at this point, PLEASE!!!

My medical conditions are being evaluated by a team of physicians and specialists, so that's not what my question is about, but background info is helpful. After sudden-onset worsening dyspnea with exertion, I had an echo done on 2/26, and since then have had multiple EKGs done (5/15, 9/8, 10/2).

My ECG results were reported as normal with trivial tricuspid regurgitation only, with heart size listed as normal.

My EKGs say otherwise;5/15 clinical impression reported as

**RAE-Right atrial enlargement-P>0.25mV 2 lds or<-0.24mV aVR/aVL**

**CRVH-Consider right ventricular hypertrophy-large R or R' V1/V2**

9/8 clinical impression reported as

**APC-Atrial premature complex-SV complex w/ short R-R interval**

**RAE-Right atrial enlargement-P>0.25mV 2 lds or<-0.24mV aVR/aVL**

**SD0IN-Minimal ST depression, inferior leads-ST <-0.04mV, II III aVF**

10/2 clinical impression reported as

**ST-Sinus tachycardia-rate>99**

**RAE-Right atrial enlargement-P>0.25mV 2 lds or<-0.24mV aVR/aVL**

**AXR-Borderline right axis deviation-QRS axis (90,110)**

**REPB-Borderline repolarization abnormality-ST dep & abnormal T**

&#x200B;

1. Can heart size change in 3 months, explaining the difference in ECG>EKG?
2. Can you please help me understand what these impressions mean? I am having difficulty getting them explained by physicians.
3. What are the implications of these conditions? Like, if I have atrial enlargement, what does that mean?

"19F, 5'2, 130lbs, caucasian. I have vitamin D deficiency, which tends to impact my depression, but is currently 100% managed with OTC supplements, blood tests have returned within normal ranges during supplement use.

I drink occasionally, used to smoke recreationally (tobacco and weed) but have completely ceased both for some time now. I also used to use recreational drugs (dabbled in things like acid, MDMA, xanax, the aforementioned weed) but I also have completely stopped use for several months now.

I have experienced anxiety for many years, beginning before adolescence but over time only seeming to be getting worse overall. Specifically, social anxiety tends to be my main problem, but it is present in virtually every waking moment.

I have propranolol, 20mg I believe, to take on days which I will be experiencing something anxiety inducing, and it really helps. I tend to panic a lot less and I can stay calm and collected to do whatever needs to be done. The issue is that I feel very tired and lethargic the next day (and dont even get me started on taking it multiple days in a row- it only gets worse, not to mention lowering my already fairly low blood pressure), which is difficult because I do manual labor at my job, in 10 to 12 hour shifts. I really need my energy, so I have stopped taking this medicine almost entirely because its too much of a hindrance. Not to mention that I cant sleep for over 12 hours after I take it, so taking it any time other than as soon as I wake up would interrupt my sleep cycle.

SSRI's tend to give me bad reactions, such as excessive sleepiness to the point of 14+ hours of sleep in a day and a very 'off' sort of feeling. My experience is with Lexapro and Prozac.

My main question would be, is there any sort of medication that would meet what I need?

History:
Appointment 1 a few months back: 
I came in for a separate, nsfw bleeding issue*, which went away in the weeks that followed. My doctor wanted me to come back in 6-8 weeks for a follow-up appointment, which I postponed a week because of my period and then another week because of taking plan B (a condom issue occured). 

At the second appointment, she would see if the bleeding was gone (it was), do a normal appointment, do some blood work and prescribe an extra form of birth control.

*there's no need for this post to be nsfw, but said bleeding may be relevant to my diagnosis, so I'll include a SFW explanation. The basic just is: I experienced bleeding from my cervix the first 2-3 months I began [insert euphemism here]-ing, and it eventually went away. There was also a lot of pain the first few times because I tore part of my hymen. (I think this is SFW, since these are medical terms for female anatomy, and I don't talk about specifics?)
.
Appointment 2, a two weeks ago: 
My doctor did a full exam and said that everything looked healthy; however, she recommended getting an ultrasound because she suspects I have pcos (due to longer cycles and excess hair) (which I though was a bit much, but agreed to without objection). She decided to wait to prescribe birth control until after the lab results were back and the ultrasound was done.
.
Appointment 3: will be in a week from now, I'm going to have an ultrasound, talk about my lab results, and hopefully be prescribed birth control

Here are my main questions:
1) Since I don't have increased Testosterone levels, is pcos still a possibility?
2) What birth control option would be best for increasing my SHBG level? I know some help, and I'm hoping to use the ring based on my habits and lifestyle. Would this be a good idea hormonally?

"F28, height 5’6, weight 160lbs, 37 weeks + 2 days pregnant, non smoker, no alcohol, don’t have GD or preeclampsia, or any other health or pregnancy complications besides what is described in this post 

I’ve had a totally uneventful, healthy pregnancy, up until ten days ago, when at a routine ultrasound they spotted that the fetus was on the smaller side (AC around 10th percentile, fetal weight around 20th percentile), looked into the MCA PI, UA PI, and CPR and found the CPR to be in the 2nd percentile. The doctors recommended that we chug through until I hit 37 weeks and then induce, and that I come in every other day for monitoring. 

It’s been ten days, and the CPR has sort of hovered around the 5th percentile when it’s been measured, until today, when it measured 29th percentile.

Fairly consistently the UA has measured around the 90th percentile, and MCA has measured between 7th percentile and 20th percentile. Today, the MCA measured 25th percentile and UA measured in the 55th percentile, leading to a much higher CPR (29th percentile). 

Obviously these numbers seem great! I’m just so confused how this happened. The doctors in my previous appointments have indicated that it doesn’t really happen that these percentiles change so drastically. How and why would the UA PI drop so much over the course of a couple days? Is this normal and good? Or is it possible maybe the measurements were off today? Maybe all the other measurements were off and everything has been fine all along? 

I’m going back for more monitoring in a couple days and I’m wondering if I should expect everything to be totally normal and possibly to carry until I go into labor on my own, or whether it’s more likely that today’s measurements were off and they’ll go back down and I’ll still be recommended to induce early.

"Hi everyone! Hoping to get some much needed insight...

I am a 29 year old female in Toronto, Canada with the condition Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH).  I suffer from debilitating headaches and I've got papillidema from the increased pressure. I've had multiple lumbar punctures in the past-  all leading to CSF leaks, low pressure headaches and blood patches. Needless to say I am very apprehensive to have anything go near my spinal cord due to the physical and emotional trauma caused.

I have been avoiding the idea of pregnancy for a long time as I know that it could potentially increase my symptoms and lead to further damage to my optic nerves and thus vision loss. Most of my symptoms are currently made worse by hormonal changes around my period so I'm worried about how pregnancy hormones will affect my pregnancy. 

With all this said, I am getting to the point where I desperately want to have a child with my partner and it is a life change that is very imminent. My concerns now mainly lie with the actual delivery process.

My main question is: given my health condition, am I allowed to request a cesarean section under general anesthesia? I absolutely do not feel comfortable with an epidural or spinal block and absolutely do not feel comfortable with a vaginal delivery as CSF pressure raises with pushing. 

I am terrified and apprehensive to get pregnant unless I know that my preferred method of delivery/anesthesia will be honored. I don't want to put myself more at risk.

"# Urgent - Wife and I need advice on when to get c-section

1. Yesterday, wife (female age 36, born 1984) and I went into hospital to check on baby. Wife is about 170cm tall, 70kg normally. Normal health and doesnt take any medications. Baby's due date is June 6, so just a few days later. We were trying for a VBAC, vaginal birth. The doctor said that the baby's heartbeat is weak, therefore having a c-section would be best. He was very very insistent on pushy on this.
2. After we agreed to do the c-section and went into the hospital, another nurse looked at the chart and said the heartbeat is completely normal. She also said that in the past, she has seen the doctor push patients towards c-section so he can collect more room fees. So now we think maybe the best thing to do is wait. Although the doctor keeps pushing for c-section.
3. Wife had a previous baby and was almost 2 weeks overdue. In the end, she had to induce labor, but that led to complications, and so the 1st baby was a c-section. I'm worried that because the 1st baby was late, the 2nd will be late as well. And since the 1st pregnancy was complicated, we cant induce labor. But if the labor comes too late again, that might have more complications.

Any advice? What is best thing to do?",18.0,6.642005421238283,18.0,0.025,0.907,0.067,0.8892,1270,2,0.37307864497836146,0.45
"31F, caucasian, 5'10"", 130kg, on HRT - estradiol, bicalutamide (transgender). 

Doesn't drink, no drugs. 

&#x200B;

My transgender partner has severe social anxiety it is hard for her to leave the house. So medical care has been sparse.

&#x200B;

She was born prematurely and had some hacked together nasal passages due to this, she has mentioned having plastic tubes installed in her nasal passages at birth I'm not sure how correct that is.

&#x200B;

She has had a lifelong issue with congestion, always sinus troubles. Lately 5 nights a week she sleeps maybe a couple of hours a day, spends a long time in the shower trying to decongest.

&#x200B;

She has been using, repeatedly (1 bottle a week of each) the following nose sprays: oxymetolazine and phenylephrine. This has been happening now for close to 2 years.

&#x200B;

In the last couple of months she has used sudafed pills to sleep every second night. We have also bought a humidifier for the bedroom and run AC to make sure she sleeps comfortably when she can sleep.

&#x200B;

I realize she now probably has rebound congestion from all of the nose sprays continuously, so what do we do? How do we solve this, I'm so scared she will stop being able to breathe. Some nights she fights for breath. Some mornings she wakes up suddenly unable to breathe and runs to a steaming shower to help it. Please help.

"(Posted this on the August bumpers group but more people here would see it too!)

I’ll be 40 weeks on the 24th August and I’m already so stressed about going overdue. I’ve been under consultant led care from weeks 28-36 as baby girl had dropped significantly on her growth trajectory (90th percentile to 10th-30th). This has meant I’ve had almost weekly scans and we didn’t think we were ever going past 37 weeks (we were preparing for steroid shots and buying tiny baby clothes as she wasn’t expected to stay in until August). The last 2 scans though she’s sat around 50th percentile so I’ve been discharged from consultant led care back to midwife led care. At the last consultant appointment I was told I’d be induced at 40+12 if baby was still stubborn, I actually could have cried as it just felt like I was hearing pregnancy was going to last 5 weeks longer!

Other than her growth concerns I’ve been in hospital a couple times for baby’s heart rate being too high and a couple days ago my hands ended up blue from swelling (it looked like I had bruises from punching across all my knuckles and fingers!) Baby always calms down enough for the hospital to let me go, but now I’m worried about going over for both her sake and my own - I’ve had back pain from 18 weeks and SPD from 32 weeks, my hips and pelvis are wrecked!

I’ll be 41 weeks on the 31st (which is also my birthday and I really don’t want to have the same birthday!) and 41+5/ 40+12 on Sept 5th. 

I really want baby to arrive before the end of August for a few reasons:

1. I’m worried about increasing risks of her being in up to 40+12 considering the issues I’ve had with the pregnancy (especially as we had so many concerns with her growth/ potential placenta issues and the placenta degrades as time goes on). 
2. I'm struggling more and more with SPD
3. So she can make it into that school year (UK specific!) - I dont want baby to have to wait a year longer to go to school (she would have to be in daycare anyway as husband and I both work full time)
4. I don't want us to have the same birthday (a superficial reason I know)

I’m already trying every old wives tale I can to try and encourage baby!

I next see my midwife on the 26th (40+2) where I’m hoping to get a sweep (no cervical checks available prior to 40 weeks in my trust) has anyone (especially in the UK) advocated for earlier inductions than the hospital ‘standard’? The thought of going 12 days over is stressing me out so much!",29.0,7.86568871294421,29.0,0.071,0.824,0.105,0.9694,2489,1,0.6761260832301685,2.0589999999999997
"I'm a 27 year old female and I have a history of painful, long, heavy, irregular periods starting when I was 14. I live in a rural area with one women's clinic and a few other hospitals and small clinics, but there really are not a lot of options for medical care. I have a primary care doctor that is great for a lot of things, but I go to the women's clinic for my Nexplanon implant. The only other medication I take is a 24 hour release 15 mg adderall.

I just had my Nexplanon replaced (this is my second now) about 4 months early because my periods came back in full force and I was miserable. The people at the women's clinic tried to talk me into an IUD, but I expressed that with my pelvic pain during periods, I'm unwilling to try something that is inserted, and Nexplanon did very well for me for the most part. They asked me a little about my symptoms and agreed that sticking to what I know works would be best for my dysmenorrhea. This is the first time I'd heard that word, and they clarified that it was just the word for ""painful periods."" I came home and did some digging, looking at the symptoms, and it does kind of fit the bill. Two things threw me off- I mentioned that during my period, my sciatic nerve pinches really badly, and my labia feel bruised and painful to the point of having to be careful how I sit. I didn't see anything about that anywhere, even after trying to research that specifically. I've talked to my primary care doctor about this as well, and we did hormone tests that came back relatively normal, and she kind of... discouraged me from being examined to look for endometriosis. Her reasoning is that its invasive, and since my birth control fixes the problem, it would be unnecessary. 

My doctor has been so great about other things, but after learning the term ""dysmenorrhea"" from another doctor I had seen one time and thinking about her discouraging me from further examination or testing, I'm really unsure about trusting her on this issue. Is she probably right and just sticking to birth control to manage my pain the right course of action? I don't want children, so this seems viable to me. On the other hand, could leaving the cause unknown exacerbate the problem without my knowledge and cause serious health issues down the line? The whole situation has me really confused about if I'm overreacting or not. I don't want to make the situation worse by trusting her, and I WANT to trust her, but I can't help but feel like it might be a mistake.",32.0,7.87092477571414,32.0,0.11,0.76,0.131,0.942,2505,2,0.8396305625524768,3.52

I'm a 22 year old female. 26 weeks premature with coronal synostosis that was treated, I take trazadone 150mg for sleep , gabapentin for anxiety 100mg daily, 7mg mirtazapine for appetite and depression, junel birth control, smoke Marijuana for appetite, focus and social anxiety.  

I have been avoiding caffeine, haven't had coffee and my energy drink is undesirable because I do not want to agitate this.  I do not smoke cigarettes and I haven't smoked Marijuana in a few days just to see how I'm feeling. 

Since I haven't been smoking I've been unable to really eat well, but I've been managing to consume a little every now and then but its been 3-4 days. 

Every morning I wake up with fluttering in my chest and shallow? Heavy heartbeat idk how to describe it but it's almost like electricity and a thundering heartbeat. It consists through out the day. Sometimes if im not laying down it feels worse, other times I'm not wanting to lay down because I'm anxious for it to happen again. 

I take my gabapentin , and still have these issues. I can take up to 300mgs. Nothing im calm. My mind isn't racing yet I still feel this fluttering. I never have chest pain, but one time there was a light dull pain but I don't know if its the lung or not. 

I'm fatigued and unmotivated. Sometimes going up an elevated street takes away my breath or going up 1 flight of stairs. Sometimes I'm woozy. 

I've been dealing with nausea and severe acid reflux, excessive burping and sometimes vomiting due to the acidity making me sick. Or at times I'm unable to eat because its so uncomfortable.  I take omeprazole 20mg daily and sometimes it just doesn't help. And I can press on my diaphragm sometimes and force a burp out unnaturally sometimes too. It's very upsetting and daily.

I've been having diarrhea sometimes. Its been green and runny and sometimes my tummy gets upset. 

I've taken my blood pressure (113/71). Last night it was high. My heart rate currently is 70bpm. 

Constant temperature changes. Sometimes it feels like my skin is burning then it gets really cold and im shivering but sweating or clammy. Especially in the hands and feet. My mom just told me my temperature was low with the heater on 80° and in the last hour I've complained like 20 times about my body getting hot or cold or both out of no where.

About two days ago I started developing a slight pain in my elbow. For the past two days I would rate it about a 4/10. Ladt night and this morning I am in agony.

Here's the story: I have pretty severe scoliosis, and went to PT for many years. This year covid-19 hit, so i haven't seen my PT since March. I spoke with him, he gave me some exercises to keep up, and its been very beneficial. Mostly stretches and yoga types of movements.

I've done some movements for strengthening but nothing crazy, I definitely don't overdue anything. I'll do 3 sets of 10 pull ups and 3 sets of 20 pushups, with planking. 
I did this on Monday night, and did a few more than usual but really did not feel like I pushed myself. 
The next day, Tuesday I took a long hike, about 13 miles. As I was hiking, my elbow felt sore but I thought nothing of it.
Wednesday the soreness was more noticeable.
Yesterday about the same, so i did some light stretches with my arm, it began to feel better.
Today, the pain increased. It is located near where my elbow meets my triceps. It was 3am and I cant sleep because of the severity of the pain. My entire tricep and elbow is in intense pain, probably a 9/10. It is not swollen, other wise I would post pictures.

Hi! Back in July of 2019 I was 3 months PP and they had me do the Mirena IUD. I felt great before I got it I had gotten lab work done and all was normal they gave me the iud and that night I had the worst pain, worse than labor. The dr said it was normal. 

The next day I was still in so much pain but it continued up until recently. I also developed hypothyroid after getting it in place. Never had any tests show I was even bordering it, then I have had severe menstrual pain and very heavy bleeding 20 days out of the month every month.

Went gluten free in January of this year and follow an anti-inflammatory diet for optimal thyroid function. I have lost weight due to this change (37 lbs), though it was not my intention and I’m really not complaining about it, but also dismisses it as any potentially related symptom. 

On October 7th, I had a telehealth appointment with my PCP and Sjögren Syndrome was on the radar (not sure if this is any correlation, but is the reason I had many tests done). On Oct. 28, I had an in-person visit to go over symptoms and what not. Between the time of the telehealth visit and the in-person visit, I started having abdominal point pain slightly above my belly button and point near my right hip. 

Appendicitis was briefly considered, but didn’t make sense to me with the duration of pain and no increase to associate. A CT with and without contrast was done as well as a lot of blood tests (looking at aforementioned Sjögren’s and for anything that could signal the abdominal pain). CT was normal, as was most blood work, other than showing slight anemia and vitamin d deficiency. Rheumatologist weighed in and suggested supplements. 

I was sent on my way being called a “medical mystery” and to try tums. Abdominal tenderness continues. It’s not a constant pain, just a feeling of soreness when slight pressure is applied across my abdomen (when my kids sit on my lap and lean against me, or when they wrap their legs around me for a big hug). Increased pressure in the midline near my belly button and off to the right hip do hurt substantially. Thursday afternoon, I got a sudden and persistent nausea which has continued through today. 

Any idea what the pain could be originating from that a CT might have missed? Would this new nausea be related or maybe something different? No chance of pregnancy. 😉

I feel like I’m not going to find any relief bc the CT was normal, as was most blood results, and I’m classified as a mystery. 😕",36.0,7.82505619761649,36.0,0.117,0.804,0.078,-0.9499,2217,2,1.4998077169593644,4.212000000000001
"My baby was born at 32 weeks, he is now 5 months old (3 month corrected age).  Today my mother fed him some sugar water on a spoon to help him move his bowels along. He opened his mouth and swallowed properly etc for the spooned water and she said that he might be ready for weaning on to a bit of food because of this. Just wanted to hear what other parents have done. Would a premature baby be ready for solids earlier because they have been using their stomach longer? I was going to initially wait til he was 5-6 months corrected age. He is breast fed and has CMPI.",33.0,5.775184117269195,33.0,0.0,0.934,0.066,0.7717,569,1,0.0,0.0
"So grateful in advance and feeling so helpless. I'm a 37 year old female - 5'9/145 lbs, former D1 collegiate athlete - not terribly actively lately due to busy work schedule - but completely ""fit"" by BMI/aesthetic purposes. 5 years ago...i slowly developed an increased propensity to sweating, whenever i'd perform a mild activity - that wouldnt make others sweat. For instance - a ping pong game with friends, or running out to the mailbox...it started getting progressively worse, exponentially - to the point, this past winter - I would have to carry my coat in below freezing weather on my walk to the train in the morning - because if i wore my coat, by the time i got on the train, id be so flushed...and worse, soaking and dripping with sweat from my head down my face that it would horrify others so bad, i'd have to get off the train. My job used to be face to face meetings with clients each week - and i had to stop, because even walking from my building, to the car, parking, and walking up to a new office, would send me into a soaking wet overheated mess. 

When this happens - my entire body sweats (not just armpits feet palms)...and its not just sweat - im burning up from within, as if i'd just run a marathon. It usually subsides within 5 minutes - though im soaking wet - often then freeezing cold as now the air conditioning or winter air is meeting my sweaty body. 

Last winter i proactively went to GP to get overall tests on blood/urine/general health levels...and everything came up almost alarmingly perfect. The GP put me on mild dose of benztropine - aimed to illicit the side effect it produces at higher levels in parkinsons patients ... though (1 i didnt stop sweating and 2) i couldnt handle the ""hangover"" feel. 

Its gotten so terrible, that i had to lay in front of my fan for 20 minutes after walking down 2 flights of stairs to pick up a delivery order. Definitely stopped socializing (before Covid) in recent months...even friends and coworkers that understand and non judgemental - its just the discomfort. 

Non Smoker. Eat healthy. Recently - last month - totally unrelated...i had a random case of orbital cellulitis - after a routine biopsy on my nose - and was in ICU for 5 days. the anomoly in my case...was that the typical fever associated with such infection - was never present - i'm usually 98.1 when i go to the doctor - even when i should be at 104!

"Hi all!

So I'm currently 12 weeks pregnant with my first child, and I am starting to consider my birthing options.  Tbh the thought of going through vaginal birth terrifies me, I cannot picture myself doing it.  The thought of tearing makes me sick to my stomach. My mom had 3 C-sections and I guess I always just thought if I ever had a baby I would have one too.  

Well, after doing some research, apparently elective C-sections aren't as common as I thought they were, and there's a good chance that my insurance won't cover it.  I haven't spoken to my ob about this yet, because of covid I have only had one appointment so far and won't be seeing her again until July.  I am 35, and so far there haven't been any complications with my pregnancy although because of my age I am considered ""high-risk"".  

I guess what I'm looking for is women who elected to have a c-section to share your experience with me - how did you broach the conversation with your ob?  What were your reasons for choosing surgery?  Would you make the same decision again?  Did your insurance cover it and if not, how much was your out of pocket costs?

If you're one of those mombies that believes that you're not a real woman/mom if you don't give birth naturally, kindly fuck off and stay off this thread.

"Welp. I didn't stand a chance. Glucose was 4mg over after my 12 hour fast before I even drank the stuff. So now I need to know any ideas to induce labor asap at the start of August Because I refuse to be induced if I can help as it will be way too traumatic. Please help. Also any tips for dealing with this until August. By then I'll be 36 weeks and it will be safe to have her 

EDIT FOR CLARITY ON WHY THIS IS NECESSARY:
I have sexual trauma. It will be traumatic. I already know this. I already had planned with a midwife they would wait til 42 weeks before inducing and no cervix checks and touch me as little as possible. Being induces and having GD means I get none of what was promised now . On top of the CPTSD I have autism so being touched and any needles (so all the IVs for pitocin and other bs) also have me traumatized. We're not even gonna talk about what a c section would do to me.",23.0,6.732254949313515,23.0,0.093,0.818,0.089,-0.1796,902,0,1.0448264239973037,2.139
"This pregnancy I found out I will have a baby with a congenital heart defect and she will have surgery just a few days after her scheduled csection which is set for two days before her EDD. 
My first pregnancy went to exact due date. And even with that it was full moon, I had the membrane sweep the prior week, water broke first, etc. then labor was delayed because I got scared when they kept telling me things I didn’t understand (like dry birth, slow labor, weak labor, you can’t get there without pitocin+epidural) and finally I ended up using all the fun stuff plus getting a csection. So while I’m a STM I have no experience with pushing a baby out. My first was on his way out by the time his heart rate went down so much that they pushed him back up to do a csection. 
So, with this pregnancy being high risk because of her defect, I really want to do everything I can to make it my csection date. I know we cannot plan for everything (remember I’m having a baby with a heart defect, didn’t plan for that) so I’m not expecting this all to be rules for it work or guides that are full proof. 
If we can have a discussion of your opinions, experiences, things you think make you deliver early and could be a possible cautionary tale, etc. I’d like to hear them all. 
Thank you!!!

"I am a 24 year old white male, 6' 2"", about 160 lbs.

As the title says, my mom had a pretty tough labor period when I was brought into the world and I ended up being a C-section birth. I know that both she and I were knocking on death's door for about 36 hours as I suffered from a bilateral pneumothorax. As far as I know, I have never had any lung issues since surviving that incident. 

I'm curious whether this early life experience might increase the chances that I experience complications related to COVID-19 in the event that I catch the virus. As of the time of writing this, I don't have any symptoms and have no reason to believe that I've been exposed. However, my state has just decided to 're-open' and I just wanted to know. I'm guessing that there isn't much, if any, information on this particular combination of conditions right now as we continue to learn more about the novel coronavirus. So I'm asking this fully aware that there may not be a concrete answer. I appreciate any input! 

Thanks

"37wks and I might have over done it but all day today I've had pain below both shoulder blades and now right in the middle of the base of my spine. That one does not feel like sciatic pain (which I'm familiar with).

Even though its my 3rd I was admitted both times before anything really started with active labor so I don't know what it really feels like outside the hospital setting.
