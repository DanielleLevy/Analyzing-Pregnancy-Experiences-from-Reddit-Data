BabyBumps,The 20 anatomy week scan: What sonographers are looking at,"Hi everyone! As a Sonographer, I thought you guys might be interested in learning about what we have to know/look at for the 20-week anatomy scans. This is a medical procedure, and we are looking at many potential problems that can occur during a baby's growth. It can be a pretty stressful exam for a sonographer. This is sometimes the only exam where baby is really checked over, and they want to be careful to not miss anything and stay on schedule for their other patients, while also trying to be professional and kind to the mamas. It can be a hard balance, but we try and do our best.

This might be a little long, but I'll try and break it up.

If you have any other questions about procedure and what's going on behind the scenes, you could ask in r/ultrasound. While we don't do diagnoses there, or interpret images, we are happy to help people understand what is going on during the ultrasound, why we do/don't do certain things and what the machine is capable of!

I'm hoping that this information is informative and interesting, and doesn't cause anyone additional stress. I hope that you walk away from reading this realizing the depth of our checks on the baby at the 20 week scan and take that positively, not worrying about every possible thing that could possibly go wrong.

&#x200B;

Step 1: Count the babies, count the placentas, find fetal heart activity. We first need to know what we are working with, so we start with a broad overall view. After figuring out all the we have to deal with, we then make sure that the baby or babies have heart movement, because if we can't find that, the exam and day is going to change for the worse. Everyone comes in excited for a gender reveal and assuming their baby is healthy, but unfortunately that is not always the case. :(

Step 2: It's not just about the baby. After checking out the baby and placenta, we look at the woman's cervix and uterus, to make sure there are no problems there - related to or unrelated to the pregnancy.

Step 3: Back to the baby. We measure the amount of amniotic fluid, making sure there is not too much or two little. They can mean different things to a pregnancy, and can let us know if there might be any problems or potential problems to be monitored for (diabetes, preeclampsia, or just simple dehydration).

Step 4: Assuming from now on there is baby with a healthy heartbeat found, our next steps are to make sure that the organs are on the right sides of the body and figure out how the baby is laying within the mother. We check that the heart and stomach are on the left sides of the body, and use that information to know what way the baby is facing as they inevitably flip around during the exam.

Step 5: The actual fetal anatomy survey. I'm not going to put this in order, because we can't always do it in a specific order. We try to do it in ""chapters"", and keep related images together. Order depends on the position of the baby. There are so many things to check, and sometimes the baby is not in a good position to see some things accurately. So, we take them in the order that the baby allows, and hope that they don't turn over too fast, or that they do turn over after we finish one side, haha.

BRAIN: Since the baby's skull isn't bone yet, but cartilage, we can see through it. Our goal is to find certain brain structures. Since the baby's skull forms/grows from the outside towards the center, if we can find certain structures near the center/midline of the brain, it means that everything until that point has grown correctly. If you're building something and mess up step 1, the rest of the steps are going to get messed up too. By proving that different central brain structures are the right size, shape, and in the right place, we prove that the baby's brain is correctly formed. There are 6 brain structures that we have to locate and image, and a few of those we have to measure. At this time, we also measure the head circumference and diameter, to make sure that the baby is at the right size for its age. Lastly, we look at the brain's blood supply, and make sure that it is getting all it needs.

This is also where we can, if we are in the right spot, take a measurement of a nuchal fold. If the nuchal fold measurement is too large, it means that there is an increased risk of a genetic trisomy disorder. Which means any of the disorders related to having 3 of a chromosome instead of two. (Trisomy 13, Trisomy 18, or Trisomy 21/Down's Syndrome)

FACE: We look for a profile shot (this is often one of the ones you take home), to look at the nasal bone, lips, and chin. We also look at the lips and nose from a second, straight on angle, that lets us see the contours better. We want to find a nasal bone, because if it is absent, it is associated with some of those Trisomy conditions and means that there is a higher risk that the baby has one of them. We look at the lips to make sure that there is not a cleft lip. If we know about a cleft lip ahead of time, it can be easier on the parents and hospital staff to fix it as soon as possible after birth. We can also see the lenses in the eyes, which means the baby does not have cataracts.

\[I'm going to say a little something about what we call ""soft markers"" here. Some of these things such as the nasal bone being absent, or the nuchal fold being a little large, are called SOFT MARKERS. There are quite a few of them, and they happen in completely normal babies. We call them soft markers because if there is just one of them, we are not at all worried about the baby having a problem. When they show up in multiples however, we recommend further testing because there is an increased risk of some disorders. But having just one of them is a normal variation.\]

SPINE: The baby needs to be back facing up for this one, and we look at the whole spine from the neck to the tailbone. We have to make sure that each vertebra has 3 points, and that the skin is covering the entire back over the spine. We're looking for spina bifida here, a failure of the spinal cord to be enclosed.

ABDOMEN: We look at the lungs, heart, kidney, stomach, and bladder. When we can see the stomach and where the umbilical cord comes in, we know that we are at the right spot to measure the abdomen. This measurement helps us guess at the baby's weight.

LUNGS: Are they there? Are there any masses or fluid pushing on the lungs?

HEART: The position and axis that it is on. It should be about mid-chest, but pointing to the left. We need to check that all 4 chambers are there, and that there are barriers between them and valves opening and closing as the blood moves. We look at the different ways that everything connects to the heart, and make sure everything is in the right place and connected correctly - no holes anywhere.

KIDNEYS: We make sure they are the correct size and in the correct places. We check to make sure that urine is draining properly, sometimes it can get a little ""backed up"" and the kidneys will be dilated.

STOMACH: We just need to see that it is on the left side.

BLADDER: While the baby is inside you, its urinary system is working and practicing. The baby swallows amniotic fluid, which we can see in the stomach. Then, if everything is connected correctly and working, we can see the bladder fill up, then empty. All this happens at least 1 time per hour, so we need to be able to see it to confirm that everything is working correctly. So during the 1 hour scan time, we need to be able to see the bladder full at one point, and the bladder empty. They don't have to be in that order, though. Often we will check at the very beginning if the bladder is full or empty. If it started out full, and when we look later it is empty, we know that it is working. If it was empty, and now it is full, we can assume that it is working properly as well.

LIMBS: You would think this would be easy, but when the baby is flailing around in there, sometimes a sonographer realizes that they just measured the same arm twice and have to redo it. As part of our measurements for size, we measure the length of the femur (thigh bone), which also helps for weight calculations. Other than that, we are just taking pictures looking for presence/absence of all the limbs and bones. start at a shoulder, take the upper arm image, follow it down, forearm, and then get a hand with all the fingers. Repeat other side, then repeat with legs.

And that's the full medical anatomy scan of the baby.

Step 6: Placenta and umbilical cord - make sure that it has all of the arteries and vein it needs (2 arteries, 1 vein), and make sure the placenta looks healthy and isn't too close to the cervix. When I was learning this, I wasn't surprised to hear that we had to check and make sure the umbilical cord wasn't wrapped around the babies neck, with so much moving around. I was surprised, though, to hear that we only get worried if it is wrapped around the neck 2 or more times. apparently, once is normal and perfectly fine, they'll probably flip it off with all the moving about in no time.

Step 7: The part everyone was waiting for. Check out those fun bits, and find out if you're going to have a boy or a girl. Hopefully they're not crossing their legs and shy. :)

&#x200B;

After the anatomy scan, some places offer a trans vaginal ""cervical length screening"" to see if you are at-risk for preterm delivery. If you've had a preterm delivery before, they usually recommend you get it. If you don't have any risk factors, they don't often press if you're not interested. For the screening, they have you take your pants/underwear off, feet in the stirrups, and insert the transvaginal probe. Then they take measurements of your cervix length, and then a few videos of what the cervix looks like when there is pressure being put on your abdomen, like there would be when you have contractions. For this, we press firmly on your lower abdomen while taking a clip of the cervix. If it opens up at all, that could be a cause for concern to be discussed with your doctor.

A transvaginal exam can also be useful if your placenta is particularly low-lying. Then the tech can see exactly how close it is to the cervix, or if it is covering the cervix at all. Sometimes it can be difficult to see, especially if baby's head is low.

&#x200B;

I hope that didn't scare anyone, and I hope it was interesting to you guys.

Have a happy, healthy pregnancy!!

EDIT: 9/30/21 - I added some additional details that I may have left out, and tried to clarify a bit better.

BabyBumps,"Hopefully this helps anyone, preterm birth.","Hello,  while I’m currently not pregnant myself, I’ve seen A LOT of parents have worries (understandably) about preterm birth, survival or potential outcomes, so it feels right, being 22 now, to use my birth as a beacon of hope for parents in similar situations, as I see many survival stories, but none from adulthood/long term. 

I was born in 1998, at 24 weeks, weighing 1lb 5oz. When I was born, they thought I was dead. I had countless blood transfusions, bilateral grade 3 IVH (brain bleed), grade 3-4 are severe. Many times they tried to take me off of the ventilators so I could breathe, and I’d just end up crashing. My parents often walked in to them performing chest compressions. They told my parents that I’d be severely disabled, mentally retarded, unable to walk, talk, see or hear. They offered to take me off of life support. 

I’m here at 22 now, I have aspergers (which runs in my family) and ADD/anxiety (also genetic), and dyscalculia (maths dyslexia) That’s it. No movement issues at all, not even asthma. I’ve grown up around second hand smoke. Now, I know not every story is like mine, but the point is to never lose hope. In the eyes of the doctors, I shouldn’t be able to write any of this to you. Medicine has improved a lot since 1998.",124,11,2020-10-05,preterm birth
BabyBumps,Studies are showing that preterm births are down nearly 40% since the start of the pandemic!,,24,10,2020-07-29,preterm birth
BabyBumps,Positive birth story despite covid-19 restrictions,"Hello, I gave birth to my first baby last month (!) and I wanted to share my birth story here, because it all went very smoothly, even though I spent most of the time by myself because my husband was only allowed in the hospital just before/after the baby came out due to the hospital's coronavirus policy. When I was pregnant I would try and read positive stories here to try and convince myself it wouldn’t necessarily be awful, so I wanted to share mine for anybody else nervous about giving birth or having to labor alone.  

tl;dr takeaway: Nothing was as horrible or painful as I worried/imagined it might be, whether it was having to spend most of my labor in the hospital by myself, the pain of contractions/delivery (I did not get an epidural even though I did have the option), or postpartum recovery with a small vaginal tear. Obviously everybody’s body and birth experience is different, but I had a relatively quick, non-traumatic and not exhausting birth even though it was my first pregnancy, so it is possible!

Background:

First-time mother, originally from the US but currently living in Japan, so my whole experience is based on how things are usually done here, which may be different from other countries

Pregnancy was super smooth except for being hospitalized for a week at 28 weeks to prevent preterm labor because my cervix was too short/starting to dilate early (apparently hospitalization for this is pretty common here in Japan but not so much back home)

Epidurals are not common here in Japan (I live in a big city and could only find about 6 clinics that even offer them) but I chose a maternity hospital that does do them, so I could have the option as a backup if necessary. 

Current hospital policy due to coronavirus is that only 1 person (who you live with) is allowed in the hospital for the birth, and even then only right before the baby actually comes out and for about an hour afterward; no visitors allowed while staying in the hospital (at mine the typical stay is 3 - 4 nights)


Details:

Even though it was my first birth the total labor/delivery time was only about 13 hours, with most of it spent at the hospital because I woke up in the middle of the night (at 40 weeks and 3 days) to contractions at 5-minute intervals and was admitted as soon as I got there. I had assumed that contractions would start out slowly and I would have plenty of notice/spend a lot of time laboring at home with my husband’s support before having to go to the hospital, but this was not the case at all. 

Going through labor by myself in the hospital was not as awful as I thought it would be - obviously I wish my husband could have been there and I expected that I would want to keep him on video call the whole time, but actually I was able to kind of doze during the first few hours and afterwards I was so focused during the contractions that I didn’t really think about whether or not anybody else was there (there was a nurse/midwife with me most of the time once things got more intense). 

A few hours after I was admitted, the nurse/midwife suggested taking a warm bath, which felt amazing and definitely made the contractions easier to bear, but they got stronger and faster after I got out which was both good and bad (more painful, but sped up the overall process)

Contractions were painful but not as much as I imagined (I’m not really sure what I was expecting). Things that worked for pain management during contractions: concentrating on my breathing, heat packs on my lower back, distracting myself with other pain i.e. scratching myself along the arm, mentally telling myself that everything was going to be fine and I would soon be fully dilated. 

At one point I did consider getting an epidural just because I wondered if it was really necessary for me to struggle without one, so I asked the midwife to check my progress. She told me I was probably already at the peak level of pain and about 8-9 cm dilated, and had me try pushing a couple of times. After that she said I seemed to be pushing efficiently so I could go ahead and push even though I wasn’t fully dilated, with an estimated 2 more hours to go. Resisting the urge to push was harder than pushing (which actually felt good/almost therapeutic in a way, concentrating on doing 2 - 3 pushes made the contractions feel like they ended faster), so I decided that if this was the max level of pain and I was allowed to push, then I didn’t need an epidural, especially since it would be a while before the anaesthesiologist could arrive anyway (it was a national holiday so they would have to be called in)

My water didn’t break until right before the baby was crowning (and I didn’t even notice it at that point) - I didn’t realize it could happen so late, but apparently my amniotic sac was very durable. Before it broke it was actually bulging out of my vagina (the midwife guided my hand to touch it and it felt like a weird warm balloon) and the midwife said she could see the baby’s head with its hair waving around in the amniotic fluid (what)

Shortly after that my husband was allowed to come into the delivery room, which gave me a big mental boost. I was especially glad he was there when the doctor came in and told me that it could all be over very soon if I got an episiotomy (even though I specifically mentioned that I didn’t want one in my birth preferences). I felt like the doctor was almost trying to pressure me into getting one, but my husband reminded me that I had said I didn’t want one and also encouraged me to keep going, which I really appreciated. In the end it only took about another 30 minutes until the baby was born and I did have a small vaginal tear, but it was shallow and healed faster than the deeper incision of an episiotomy would have. 

When the baby was finally born I felt a huge gush of warmth/release/relief, but actually I don’t recall feeling the placenta coming out at all (I did feel the prick of the needles for local anaesthesia for stitches, despite all I’d read about new moms being too absorbed in the baby to notice)

I didn’t cry when they first gave the baby to me, but I almost did when I saw my husband holding him for the first time. Even though my husband wasn’t allowed in during labor, I am very grateful that he was able to be there for the actual birth and the first hour or so afterward


And that’s the gist of my birth experience! It’s been almost exactly a month since then and our whole family is doing well - I feel basically back to normal physically despite not having gotten a full night’s sleep since the birth, the baby is growing noticeably bigger and plumper, and my husband just cannot get enough baby cuddles. I’m sure there are many challenges in store in the future, but for now we are just enjoying the moments as they come! ",357,30,2020-12-21,preterm birth
BabyBumps,"I Graduated 3 months early - Jameson was born June 28th, at 26 weeks (mostly positive)","Hey everyone, TLDR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

I figured I share my story now that things have calmed down a bit.  I went into preterm labor at 25+4 and had a baby 4 days later. Aside from having a baby in the NICU, my story is mainly positive so read on if you like. **This isn't meant to scare anyone** by any means, but for the love of God - trust your gut people. I was partially in denial but thank GOD I went in when I did or else I probably would have given birth in my bed.  (Back Story: check out my post history to read about how I did in fact lose my mucus plug and it wasn't just ""an abnormal amount of /abnormal discharge like my OB thought.) 

&#x200B;

**June 24th:** I had some cramping and chalked it up to sleeping weird/braxton hicks. It started around 3-4 am but kind of went away during the day.  Around 6 pm that night it started back up and by 10 pm I was concerned. I had also been spotting on and off all week so..red flag! I called labor and delivery and they said to come in.  

&#x200B;

**June 25th:** We got to the hospital around 12 am and the charge nurse checked me....surprise, I was 5cm dilated with a ""bulging water bag""! Everything happened extremely fast at that point. They immediately put me on a magnesium sulfate drip to slow down/stop the contractions paired with another pill to do the same thing.  They also gave me a steroid shot to help baby's lungs develop more/quicker and started me on antibiotics and IV. I got settled into a L&D room and talked to a few different doctors, nurses, neonatologist, etc to kind of game plan what would happen should I go into labor. This all happened by like 3-4 am. For the rest of the morning/day/night I was super out of it because the magnesium drip made me high as a kite.

&#x200B;

**June 26th:** They gave me the second and final steroid shot and weaned me off of some of the magnesium because it was too much for me. I was so confused and disoriented and felt like I couldn't move or breath. Once they lowered my dosage I felt a lot better. I couldn't eat either but they allowed me liquids, though I did puke them up eventually. Drugs are fun!  We watched lots of TV, mainly the Harry Potter marathon that was on syfy. 

&#x200B;

**June 27th:** They stopped the magnesium drip \~24 hours after the second steroid shot. It's not meant to be a long term solution - just long enough to make sure I got the steroid shots and then it was up to my body to decide what it felt like doing. I was eventually weaned off the other pill as well and taken off antibiotics and the IV drip and the day/night was relatively calm. I could eat again! 

&#x200B;

**June 28th:** We spent most of the early morning hours listening to some poor girl give birth - she was quite loud and it felt like hours. My theory is her labor moans must have flipped some switch in me because my contractions started up again. I started freaking out because I didn't want to give birth in the middle of the night. Up until then, I felt much more comfortable with the day shift nurses than the night shift and I just didn't want to do it. I managed to keep him in.  At some point the next morning I had an ultrasound and baby was still head down so natural birth was the way to go. 

&#x200B;

Throughout the afternoon and into the evening my contractions kept getting stronger and the OB checked my cervix. I was now 7cm dilated. They offered me an epidural which I opted for. In hindsight I have mixed feelings about getting it but I'm a baby when it comes to pain and the last 3 days were exhausting so the less I felt at that point, the better. The contractions started speeding up around 8pm and I was feeling that ""pressure"" to poop so the OB came in to talk to me. We decided that rather than wait for my water to break, we would ""control"" the environment and she'd break it herself. That way we could make sure the NICU team was ready as well. 

Around 8:30 or 8:45 we started. The OB broke my water and...the contractions stopped! We (about 12 of us in the room) all sat in the **MOST AWKWARD SILENCE** of my life (while I was spread eagle mind you) for what felt like hours (probably 4-6 mins) and then my OB was like""...welp...why don't you just try pushing?"" So I beared down and pushed my little guy out sans contractions at 8:56pm. 

He was born 2 lbs 3 oz and a little under 15 inches long. He was making noise when he came out which let me breath a small sigh of relief. I kept asking if he was okay and everyone said he looked great, they even let my husband cut his umbilical cord before they brought him up to the NICU. 

After all the theatrics, I was cleaned up and we were brought to postpartum. I learned how to pump and after a couple hours the neonatologist came in to talk to us. She explained he came out in great shape all things considered and what the variety of different machines/wires/tubes meant.  (If anyone is familiar with NICU verbiage, he was on CPAP, 21% oxygen, antibiotics, etc but nothing major).

**June 29th:** So the NICU rules at my hospital are only the parents can visit and you can't go at the same time. So around 1:30am they let my husband go see him. Around 2 am they wheelchaired me up and I got to meet him. It was surreal to say the least. We spent the next couple of days in postpartum recuperating and were quickly discharged.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. He's 29 weeks gestation and tomorrow he'll be 3 weeks old, and he's doing great! He's gaining weight, he's now 2 lbs 9 oz, 15 inches. They've taken him off some of the IVS/PICC line support he was originally getting and is now just on CPAP. One of us can do Skin to Skin for \~3 hours a day and he's eating my milk and making slow and steady progress. He can even wear clothes soon! We're obviously not out of the woods yet, but I feel like a completely different person than I did when I went into the hospital to find out I was probably going to give birth 3 months early. The nurses and doctors are so supportive, my friends have been great and I even have a close friend who went through the same thing (born at 25 weeks) who I've been leaning on. 

&#x200B;

Overall, a scary situation was handled very professionally and turned out mostly positive and I get 3 extra months with my LO. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR.** I went into preterm labor at 25+4.  I was holed up in the hospital for a few days to slow it down but ultimately had a vajayjay birth at 26+1. [Baby Jameson](https://imgur.com/a/bWOR6hp) is doing very well all things considered and I healed up just fine. He's currently in a wonderful NICU and making slow and steady progress. He'll hopefully be out by his due date (Oct 3) - best case is he gets out mid september, but there's always the chance he's in there past his due date.

BabyBumps,How careful are you being with COVID?,"Hi guys,

Like all of you, I'm trying to navigate these crazy quarantine times we're in with COVID-19.  Up until recently, we've been trying to social distance with our friends (who work in various public arenas, send their kids to day  care, etc.) by meeting outdoors and staying 6 feet apart. Now that it's getting cold, my husband and I are trying to figure out what's responsible as far as indoor gatherings go, which is up to 20x more risky as far as virus spread. 

Mostly our question is, do we ask everyone to wear a mask any time we see them indoors? It feels so awkward and also like it will lead to us not hanging out with people much this winter.

ANYWAY my question is, what are you doing with your closest friends? Masks at all times? No meetings at all? I need some guidance here. 

2 recent studies made us get a lot more serious about our distancing policies. The CDC showing COVID is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, miscarriage, and stillbirths. 

https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/covid-19-linked-to-preterm-deliveries-cdc-report-says/ar-BB197hDR?li=BBnb7Kz

Another study from JAMA done in London found that since covid, stillbirths have gone up 4x, even in babies with no birth defects. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768389

BabyBumps,"Layla's birth story - induction due to hypertension, no epidural, fast labor.","Birth stories are probably one of my favorite things about this sub. Through all 3 of my pregnancies I read them here constantly. So I feel like I should contribute my own. 


I have 3 kids; my oldest son is 3, my middle daughter is 14 months, and the baby girl is now 1 week old. My first two kids were premature. My son was born at 32 weeks due to a placental infection. He spent 21 days in the hospital. My daughter was born at 34 weeks due to preeclampsia and was released the same day as me. With this pregnancy we did weekly P17 injections from 16 weeks on and I monitored my blood pressure closely in hopes of making it to full term. And we did! Layla was born at 37 weeks 3 days weighing 6 pounds 13 ounces. 


This pregnancy was harder on my body, probably because I've spent the last 3 years constsntly pregnant. Lol. I had pretty bad morning sickness into the second trimester. Lots of aches and pains from the second trimester on. I was fortunate enough to be able to quit my job 3 months before I was due. That really took a lot of stress off my mind and body. 


At 34 weeks I had some high blood pressure reads at home and called the doctor. They told me to come in. My blood pressure was elevated but my lab work came back good. He checked my cervix and I was dilated to a 3 and 75% effaced. He seemed concerned but sent me home. 


The following weeks I was having crazy braxton hicks, my blood pressure was still high, but all my lab work was good. At 36+5 my blood pressure spiked to 180/100 at home and stayed there all day. We went to labor and delivery to be monitored. Eventually my blood pressure leveled out. Bloodwork came back with no indicators of preeclampsia. They prescribed labatelol and told me to make an appointment with my doctor on Monday, which happened to be the 37 week mark. 


At that appointment the doctor checked my cervix again. 5 cm, 90% effaced. He scheduled an induction for 2 days later because of my blood pressure and the fact that I live an hour from the hospital. I'm not gonna lie, I was really really excited. This third pregnancy was not planned. I did not want another baby. And 2020 has been a shit show. So to get to skip the last 3 weeks of pregnancy was pretty great to me. Took the covid test. Packed my bags. 


We arrived for the induction at 4:30 A.M. Wednesday morning. By 6 we had some pitocin in my iv, as well as fluids and potassium because I was deficient. The potassium burned and I had to do 2 bags of it. 


After she got everything going my nurse checked me. Dilated to a 6. She asked me if I wanted the epidural. I told her I'd like to wait and see how it goes, but I really didn't want it. My main reason for not wanting it was getting a catheter. I HATE having a catheter. I find it so uncomfortable. I knew I could probably handle the contractions because with my first kid I was dilated to a 9 by the time we got to the hospital. 


At 8:30 my midwife came in and broke my water to speed things up. I was still at 6 cm. She said she'd be back in a couple hours to check on me. After my water was broken things really heated up. My contractions had been just noticeable before. Now they were about a 6 on the pain scale and started coming very, very close together. I was still able to talk through them but it was getting harder. I asked for a birthing ball to labor on for a while. The nurse brought it in and helped get me situated on it. It helped take my mind off the contractions and I was really thankful I could move around at this point, unlike my other 2 births. 


After about 10 minutes on the birthing ball I told my husband if I wasn't close to pushing I was gonna have to get the epidural. My contractions were getting very intense and I was having to moan through them. I had him call the nurse and asked her to please check me. She helped me back into the bed and quickly checked. Said I was complete. And crowning. I couldn't hold back. There was no waiting for the midwife, a doctor, or any other nurses. My body just started pushing with the next contraction. 


2 other nurses had time to make it in, and then after 3 pushes my baby was born at 9:12 A.M. The nurse caught her. It was the first baby she'd caught and I'm pretty sure she was more scared than me. My midwife came running in at this point and sat down to deliver the placenta. I could feel that whole process much more this time and it was freaky. 


I was bleeding more than they wanted so I got a pill up my butt. Otherwise there were no complications, no tearing, and no trouble. We did a full hour of skin to skin and a while later I was able to walk to the bathroom on my own. 


I did kind of go into a bit of shock, I guess you'd say, which hadn't happened previously. I was freezing cold and couldn't stop shaking. Blood loss, maybe? I'm not sure. It passed pretty quickly. 


We had a 2 night stay in the hospital because I was group b step positive. Fortunately the baby was unaffected. But the extra day away from my older 2 kids was agonizing for me and their father. I constantly feel like I need a break, but when I am not home with them at bedtime it breaks my heart.  


This birth went as well as it possibly could have. My other experiences left me feeling like I somehow should have done more to prevent preterm birth or like my body was just failing me. But this time around, every little wish I had was fulfilled. 


I gave birth to a healthy, full term baby. 

I got to eat less than 3 hours after delivery compared to 62 hours without food in my second delivery.

I didn't spend any time on bedrest. 

I got to have a golden hour with her instead of having my baby wheeled away to the NICU. 

I delivered with no epidural (no catheter!!) and was able to handle the pain. 

We came home together.

BabyBumps,Making the decision while high risk.,"So, my husband and I are discussing whether to ttc. One problem in the decision is that I am pretty high risk. And not just one factor in it but several. I am obese, have pcos and prediabetic insulin resistance, but the biggest issue I gather is from a blood disorder called factor v leiden. My gyn said it causes miscarriages, preterm babies, blood clots, and pre-eclampsia. I'm at especially high risk for pre-eclampsia because I had it with my previous pregnancy. My endo says despite the pcos I am ovulating and should be able to get pregnant, however for me the decision is difficult largely due to pregnancy risks. I'm not really asking for advice, my husband and I will be working on the decision in counseling, just wondering if anyone here knew they were high risk beforehand while considering ttc, and how did that decision making process go for you?",6,18,2020-09-26,preterm birth
BabyBumps,Disappointed but not surprised,"This is my first post here! I've been a lurker for a while but just needed to post to get this off my chest. I'm on mobile so I apologize in advance for any mistakes and how long it's probably going to be. 

I'm a 22 year old first time mom. This is my first pregnancy ever. This was not planned by any means. It all started out very weird to begin with. I am currently 39+5. I didn't know I was pregnant until I was 14+4 already. I was on the pill and not even having sex with my fiance that much. I was getting my ""normal period"" for the first two months (January and February), but once I didn't get my period in March I was suspicious. Everything in the previous two months were normal for me, period flow and everything. Again, I was on the pill so my period was on track. I really don't know why I had a ""period"" twice in a row like that and no one has been able to tell me other than that ""it just happens"" so whatever. However, this would unknowingly cause an issue for me now. 

At this time, so from January to April (found out on April 11th) I had been smoking marijuana daily, using a Juul, and had been drunk a handful of times. I haven't gotten any genetic or any other blood testing done, and now I'm worried something could be wrong with my baby despite her measuring well and on track and being healthy. I'm an irrational, paranoid, pessimistic person, but I have been trying to keep positive. As soon as I found out I was pregnant, I stopped smoking and vaping. I wasn't much of a drinker despite just turning 21 in September 2019. I had gotten drunk maybe less than 5 times in those four months. 

I've been having cervical checks every week since 37 weeks. The first time, she told me I was 1cm dilated. At my next appointment, a different nurse told me that whoever did it last time was being generous because I wasn't even half a cm dilated. I was pretty crushed because of that. However, the baby is in position and I'm 70% effaced. I just went to my 39 week appointment, 4 days late, which is another issue I'm having: I've been going on Thursdays when my week starts (40 weeks this Thursday) but apparently both offices I go to are booked up so now my schedule is thrown off by 4 days, but whatever. As long as I can get in, I guess. Anyway, I just went to my 39 week appointment and I've had no change at all. I wanted her to strip my membrane but she obviously couldn't get in there to do so since I'm still less than half a cm dilated. Not even less then one, LESS THAN HALF! It's just... Disheartening. I've been in constant chronic pain for the last 4 weeks. I've been having cramps and contraction like feelings for the last two and it just feels like it's all been for naught. This isn't even where my disappointment stems from, though. 

I was told at 38 weeks that I wasn't eligible for an induction. Not really given an answer as to why, just told it wasn't gonna happen. At my 39 week appointment, I mentioned it again and it was explained to me that since I didn't have an ultrasound in my first trimester (clueless about being pregnant till 14 weeks, remember?) that they couldn't be *sure* I was as far as I've been told and been tracking... I *could* be 2 weeks behind in my pregnancy and they can't risk inducing me and putting me and my baby at ricks for preterm labor... First of all, why did I not know this until 39 weeks? Why wasn't this discussed in the beginning of my pregnancy? Why haven't I been given any growth scans? Another thing that makes me so pissed and frustrated at the American healthcare system is that I was lucky to even see my baby a 3rd time, all the way at 28w because I had a low lying placenta (it's not an issue anymore). That was the last time I had an ultrasound, and I understand it's hard to see baby once you get so big but I see all these posts about growth scans at 30-some weeks and I get sad because I never had one. My sister works in healthcare/OB-GYN and told me that's just how it is unless you are high risk. Which I understand but you would think they would be concerned about the growth of my baby since I had no idea until I was already in my 2nd trimester? It's frustrating! So frustrating I could cry. So I could *potentially* be a week or two behind in my pregnancy. My due date is the 22nd and this whole time I've been so excited to have an October baby. This whole time everyone has looked at me and said ""You won't make it to your due date."" Here I am with two days to go and no end in sight. 

I understand I could spontaneously go into labor right this instance. But I really don't think that's going to happen. Again, my pessimism leads me to believe everything is going to go horribly wrong. I try so hard not to think that way but it's incredibly difficult especially that it feels like no progress is being made and I've been let down. 

I feel selfish about not having my baby yet. She needs to be healthy and grow but if you were to see me... You'd think I was well last 40 weeks at this point. I've had multiple people ask me if I was sure it was one baby... I'm small and short. 5'2"" and was 110lbs prepregnancy. (I've also gained a lot of weight, I'm 167lbs now...but no one has said anything about that, so I guess I'm fine? As long as I wasn't overweight prior I guess it's okay?) I just feel like there's absolutely no way I could be less than 39 weeks. The tech seemed very sure about how far along I was at my first ultrasound, albeit shocking to see a fully formed baby when I went in there thinking I was only a few weeks along. 

I just don't know. I'm sad. I'm disappointed. I'm scared. I'm eligible for an induction at 41 weeks, which will be the 29th. But I had my heart set on an October baby. Now if I schedule for an induction on the 29th, they might not get me in by the 30th or 31st. It's just also disappointing to have this idea in your mind of when you're gonna be able to meet your baby and then all of a sudden your told it might be wrong. That you won't get to meet the baby you've been dying to meet when you thought you were. I've not only been looking forward to meeting my little girl soon, but to also be done being pregnant. I'm I'm so much pain 90% of the time every single day at this point and it's frustrating. I'm also absolutely bored out of my mind. Her room has been finished for weeks and I'm so pregnant I can't even really do anything at the moment. My feet are swollen constantly and I can't stand and walk around for more than 20 minutes at a time, and forget getting down or bending down to clean anything. That's not going to happen and hasn't been able to happen for the last month. I know I shouldn't even say that I'm bored but I am. I wanna take care of my baby, I wanna meet her and love her. I'm just ready and waiting has been torture. 

I just needed to rant because I can't rant to anyone else. My fiance already feels the same way and is just as disappointed as I am. He's also angry at healthcare in America (honestly we are both angry at the US in general) because he's confused as to why it is the way it is. I understand the ultrasound thing but... I feel like there should be a way to determine how far along I am at this point. I'm just so over everything.

BabyBumps,To Induce or Not to Induce?,"Hey guys! 

So I'm currently 37+5 and I'm trying to decide if I want to Induce or not. For some backstory, I went into preterm labor at 34 weeks, 50% effaced and 2 cm dilated. We expected me to go into labor by now, but I haven't. 

My husband just started a new DoD job and hasn't been on long enough to take paternity leave, however he can go into ""the hole."" Meaning, he can take as many weeks of leave as he wants, but has to make it up over time. As a civilian, he earns 2.5 days of leave per month, so if he took two weeks it would take a few months to make up. HOWEVER, with the current pandemic he is working two weeks on two weeks off. During his two weeks off, he's on administrative leave and still earns a paycheck and leave time without taking personal leave. 

If I talk to my OB about induction this week, I could Induce at 39 weeks and husband would get two weeks off. I wanted a natural unmedicated birth, but induction seems like it would be the best option for us. What do you guys think? If you have induced, how bad was it?",4,17,2020-07-06,preterm birth

BabyBumps,Some good news! Premature birth apparently down significantly during pandemic. (x-post from September 2020 bumpers group.),,101,15,2020-07-19,premature birth
BabyBumps,"Birth Story - First Born, Baby R, 33+2, premature, IUGR/IUWR/SGA, hypercoiled cord, C-section, NICU, positive overall.","I have got a lot of resources from this community, wanted to post my birth story in the hope that it helps someone out there. I had a birth story that flew in the face of all the expectations and preparations I had about birth, but it was also an experience that taught me that I have it in me to be flexible and resilient when caught unawares.

My due date was Oct 30, and I had a fairly uncomplicated and enjoyable pregnancy right from the beginning. I had very mild nausea, some fatigue and kept peeing a lot, but otherwise I loved my growing belly and the bonding I felt with the little kid kicking inside of me. I was looking forward to an October baby, hoping for a vaginal birth, and was practicing breathing and hypnobirthing - nature had other plans.

During my 31st week appointment, my doctor started getting concerns about his growth. He was in the 13th percentile. South Asian babies tend to measure small on standard curves measured on Caucasian babies in the west, still my doctor wanted to keep a close look on my baby and recommended rest in the meanwhile.

Things hadn’t improved much by week 33 (7th percentile now), and she noticed in the ultrasound that the cord was hypercoiled. Basically coiled around itself like an extremely kinky water pipe. There was also greater blood flow to the brain, which apparently is often a sign of stress and trauma to the developing baby.

This was on Sep 11 (last Friday), and she recommended that I go to the hospital to get fetal monitoring done to make sure all was well. This was the first that the winds started to change a bit. Babies like these tend to come a bit early, I was told, and mine might not go to full term. It would be for the best if he stayed inside and growing till week 36 or 37 if he could. I would get a couple of steroid shots to get his lungs growing in the meanwhile.

I was initially told that this was a ‘close monitoring’ situation, and didn’t even have a full hospital bag with me when I went in on Friday. I was told to get admitted, and for most of Friday and Saturday I got his heart beat monitored almost continuously. The midwives said that things looked ‘fine’ and ‘normal’ after each session, so I was hoping to be discharged on Monday, with possible additional monitoring in the coming weeks. Sep 12 (Saturday) was my husband’s birthday, and my extended family had planned a Zoom baby shower for me. I had no idea that day that at the same time the next day, I would have had my baby.

*

On Sep 13 (Sunday), around 9am, just as I was eating breakfast after a ‘looks good!’ morning monitoring session, a doctor swooped in and told me to stop eating - I was going to have a C-section later that day.

This information was completely out of the left field for me, and I think I went into shock for a few seconds. The doctor who informed me didn’t have the best bedside manner, and was rather brusque - I think she didn’t realize that we were not adequetely informed yet. I called my husband who was at home, and we got a second consult, which confirmed it. Apparently I had been having mild contractions all through, and the baby’s heart rate was dropping whenever I had one. Taken together with the other considerations (low weight gain in the last couple of weeks, kinks in the umbilical cord, possible oxygen deprivation) I was told that the baby might be safer outside the womb than inside. There was no benefits to the child staying in. They wanted to do a C-section the same day to make sure the baby would be safe.

At this point, my intuition was still that I had a healthy baby since he was moving well, just as he had been since 18 weeks, and I was feeling pretty good overall. My vitals were great, I felt fine, baby felt good. It didn’t sink in immediately that my baby was possibly in distress, I needed to have a premature, emergency C-section. 

*

Things moved in a rush after that. We got the verdict at noon, and I was immediately transferred to labor and delivery where I was prepped for surgery. I had barely a couple of hours to mentally prepare for what was to follow. For me, this was the hardest part of birth. To surrender to the unknown, to go along with the flow of events. How I handled these two hours would merit a separate post in and of itself.

During this time I tried to ask the doctors for all the ‘good’ birthing procedures that we are told are now a part of a ‘normal’, ‘positive’ birth process - delayed cord clampling, golden hour, immediate skin to skin, bonding, breast crawl... turns out, with a premature baby, you cannot have any of that. The baby would need to be thouroughly checked by the pediatricians before he would be brought to me. He would go to the NICU immediately afterward where he might stay for a few weeks. I had really looked forward to bonding with my baby immediately after birth - the hardest thing was not being able to have that.

However, by the time I got into surgery, I was relaxed and prepared to give birth, and joking with the midwives and nurses. Apart from my husband and unborn son, it was all women in the room. It felt powerful and deeply moving. The entire surgical team had all assembled there on a Sunday afternoon to bring my baby to earth safe and healthy. They wanted the best for me and my baby. They were super patient, super efficient, explained everything, acknowledged my vulnerability, and made me feel human. Overall made the birth a very positive experience despite everything.

*

Surgery is funny in that at some point, you start feeling that you are just a body, that is being ‘handled’.  You are propped up and laid down in different positions, moved from bed to bed. One arm is taken for a blood pressure cuff, another for an IV, lifted and turned to match their efficiency. Hands working all over you. At some point, you have a vague dissociated feeling, as if you are watching yourself from above. 

After my epidural (didn’t hurt at all, the most painful part was the local anesthetic), things became surreal. I didn’t feel a thing, but I knew that the baby was coming - yet it didn’t feel like he was coming out of me. Beyond the green curtain it seemed like another world. Somewhere behind the green curtain, he was coming into form. I was on the other side, laughing, dreaming...

And then there burst out a loud cry, that brought me back to earth. He had come! It was still surreal, it took a few minutes for them to take him away, check him, and bring him to me, all I felt then was - he’s here! he’s alive! I heard him cry!

He was awake and alert when they brought him to me. I couldnt hold him, but they held his head close to mine. He looked at me. He had wise old monkey eyes and wouldn’t stop looking at me. Nor could I stop looking at him. I could barely stroke him, while I wanted to hold him and hug him on my breast. 

Even then the rational part of me was looking over him carefully. He was a very small baby (later knew his birth weight was around 1600g). But he was very long, very alert and was breathing on his own. 

This is still his story, two days later in the NICU. He is doing well in terms of breathing and vital organ function. But he needs energy and weight gain in the next few weeks to get up to speed. 

*

We later found out what had happened when he was inside me.

His umbilical cord had been abnormally long, three times the normal length. And it had gotten hypercoiled - like a spring, like a kinky water pipe. Just like a long, kinked pipe is not as efficient at getting water through compared to a short, straight one, his cord was preventing him getting enough nutrients in his blood. 

To add to that, the strong, coiled cord had looped around his neck and body several times, severely restricting him. Amazingly, till 33 weeks, he had still managed to move and grow under such stress. The doctor said that he may have struggled against the cord, as if fighting off a python. But as he grew more in a confined space, there was less room to fight back, leading to a possible restriction. If the pregnancy had continued, it could have resulted in a stillbirth outcome.

*

Over the last couple of days, whenever I could snatch a moment, I have been trying to read up on hypercoiled cords. I have never come across this before, there are only 3-4 posts on reddit that pop up when I search the term. Apparently it is correlated with a lot of stillbirth events, and I had no clue that such a thing was even possible. If not for very very careful monitoring by my doctors, we might have completely missed it. No one warned us about this. A baby in the NICU is hard, but the alternative is unimaginable.

I’m posting this so that this post is available for any other expectant parents out there.

*

Our baby is in the NICU now. Two days old. I’m recovering from the C-section and pumping milk for him, but at 33 weeks, I’m told that it might still take a while to come in. Meanwhile he is on donor milk. His nurses and doctors take such good care of him. He is nourished by the bountiless kindness of unknown mothers. It moves me so much every time I think of it. 

The NICU is a world of its own. And we have it easier than many other parents of preemies. All my previous conceptions about birth and childcare are now out of the window, I am revaluating everything in the light of what we are seeing now. We hope that he will be healthy and be home soon. 

So that’s my story. Wish you all happy, healthy pregnancies and lots of baby cuddles =)",79,11,2020-09-16,premature birth
BabyBumps,Pregnancy after premature birth (incompetent cervix/PPROM) and progesterone supplementation as a preventative measure. Any moms with experience?,"Four and a half years ago I gave birth to my son at 31 weeks. My water had broken and within an hour I was at the hospital. A cervical check revealed that my cervix was pretty much fully effaced and I was 1cm dilated. I gave birth 13 hours later.

I am now expecting baby #2 and will be meeting with an OB in two days (I'll be close to 16 weeks pregnant), and I was wondering if I should insist on taking progesterone (through either vaginal suppositories or the 17P shots). I previously met with this OB (two years ago) and he only mentioned monitoring my cervix thickness through transvaginal ultrasounds for future pregnancies and using progesterone if there was evidence of thinning. However, I've recently looked up some articles and it seems like progesterone is often recommended as a preventative measure after having a premature delivery to decrease the risk of another preemie (rather than just waiting for evidence of the cervix starting to thin).

I was just wondering what other moms in a similar situation have experienced and what was recommended to them. Also, for those who supplemented, did you take progesterone vaginally or through shots?",6,8,2020-06-16,premature birth
BabyBumps,I never posted my birth story but there is something I wanted to warn you ladies about,"[Baby tax - 9 months out!](https://imgur.com/a/OFcU5wa)


So I had this little cutie back in February. I chose to be induced about a week before due date (gestational diabetes). Very slow dilating but strong contractions. And like with my first delivery, the epidural only numbed half my body. With my first, they simply replaced the epidural and it was fine after that. This time around, they apparently wanted to avoid having to replace it. So instead they injected other pain meds into my epidural. I'm pretty sure there were two different additional pain meds added and one was fentanyl. Still only numb on one side and feeling strong contractions, they then replaced the epidural almost immediately after pumping in all those extra pain meds. It helped the pain, but then I started to feel scary bad. My blood pressure was dropping super low so the nurse was pumping me with the fluids to bring it up. I had never felt so close to death. I felt like my body was shutting down; like I might just stop breathing at any moment. I was having ""the talk"" with myself mentally (you can't die, they need you! Stay awake!) It was terrifying. Slowly my blood pressure rose back up and other than shaking uncontrollably I was feeling better. Right before showtime the pain was back and although I was scared of side effects I agreed to more pain meds. It was fentanyl again, but this time I vomited almost immediately after. Then I had baby and felt everything! I screamed. I pooped. It was ugly and beautiful and I never felt more relief than I did holding him in my arms. I didn't get that experience with my first since he was 2 months premature and went straight to NICU. Anyway, just be careful with the pain meds. Don't suffer through the pain but don't let them overload you either. Best of luck to you all!",55,19,2020-11-29,premature birth
BabyBumps,"A year out, here's a few things I learned about pregnancy, birth, postpartum and sibling stuff as a STM","This subreddit is super helpful! My second son turned 1 a couple of days ago and here were a few things I learned about being a STM, maybe it might be of use to someone...

PREGNANCY

Second pregnancies are such a crapshoot! You basically can expect anything, haha. My two pregnancies were pretty similar. Overall not too terrible symptom-wise, no morning sickness. I had a lot of heartburn with my first and almost none with my second. I was definitely more tired with my second because of having to look after another kid, but also way less anxious because I sort of knew what to expect. One thing that happened to me both times was shortened cervix. I got put off work (I was in Germany) but continued to receive my salary. I tried to rest as much as humanly possible (much easier said than done) and fortunately everything ended up fine, no cerlage needed or premature birth.

You can probably expect, though, to ""show"" earlier the second time around as your muscles are more relaxed after your first birth. People knew I was pregnant around 13 weeks the second time (I am also really short and petite so it's more obvious on my body I think), there was no hiding it really.

We found out the sex with the first baby and decided to go team green with the second but that's totally a personal choice. I will say, though, I don't regret being team green and wish a bit I had done it the first time too :)

LABOR

With my first, my water broke at 37+6 and that was that, Hollywood-style gush, baby was born 11 hours later. With my second I was sort of clueless about labor starting since without my water breaking, I wasn't sure how to tell the ""real deal"" with contractions. I ended up with prodromal labor for about 3 weeks, actual contractions and dilating, I'd show up to the hospital, and then after a few hours they'd fizzle out.

Anecdotally- and this was interesting- I surveyed all my friends who had their second kids roughly around the same time who went into labor spontaneously (no inductions or scheduled C-sections) and the case seemed to be that if your first kid was ""late,"" your second had a much bigger chance of showing up on their due date or earlier and NOT being overdue. And on the flip side, virtually all my friends but one (myself included) who had their first kid significantly early term, like between 37-38 weeks (spontaneously, not induced), had the experience that their second kid came LATER- not overdue necessarily, though that was the case with some, but later than kid 1. So I think the moral of the story there is: if your first kid showed up late, the second could be late too, but be prepared for them to come earlier than your first. And if your first came on the early side, mentally prepare yourself that your second might come closer to term than your first! (Oh man, that was a personal torture...)

My obgyn said that second labors typically tend to be half the amount of time as your first labor, more or less. Held true for me (first labor was 11 hours, second about 4). So another thing to be prepared for is that things could possibly progress much more quickly.

I had an epidural with my first and an unmedicated waterbirth with my second, and vastly preferred the second experience, but I really didn't like my epidural the first time, to be honest, though I don't regret it. Since second births can be faster, though, I think it's worthwhile to at least do a bit of mental preparation that even if you do want something like an epidural, there might not be enough time to do it- it could be worth at least doing a bit of reading of coping techniques for labor in case you end up going unmedicated.

We had friends ""on call"" for labor since our families did not live close enough and a friend spent the night over at our place while my husband and I went to the hospital.

POSTPARTUM

I personally had a pretty night and day postpartum experience the second time around, i.e. it was actually way better than the first time around- I knew what to expect, the physical recovery was a lot easier, I felt more laid back and relaxed. But of course everyone's personal experience is really different. It's great to have some kind of help with the older sibling if it all possible, but I know with COVID-19 in these crazy times that might be a lot more challenging.

One thing I did stock up on before second kid arrived was some more postpartum supplies because I had lost most of mine when we moved after my first kid. I used cloth postpartum pads and breast pads, and got a couple new nursing bras as my old ones were super busted (my first kid nursed almost 2 years). I got some nipple cream as well. I ended up not needing some of the recovery stuff I used the first time and also needing some different stuff this time (this time, the big problem was the hemorrhoids).

We basically reused most baby stuff from my first kid so we really didn't get anything new for baby #2, except a new crib mattress and mattress protector, and a few more newborn cloth diapers.

SIBLING

My older kid was about 2 years and 9 months when his brother was born. We prepared in advance by reading books, talking about friends who became big brothers and sisters, acting things out with a doll, and showing him photos of himself when he was a baby. 

I think every sibling age gap has its pros and cons for sure. Some huge of pros of our kids' age gap were that older one was fairly independent in some ways when baby came, he was out of diapers so we didn't have 2 in diapers, and we had been practicing having him use the buggy board or just walk or ride his balance bike for several months before baby's arrival so he didn't need the stroller/we didn't buy a double stroller. Some cons is that there were some jealousy issues (he never actually took them out on the baby but rather on me instead) and that for instance if the baby slept in a bit in the morning we couldn't just rest with the baby but needed to get up with the older one. 

Now that the baby is a year old they play a lot together and it's been really sweet to watch them together. However, every sibling relationship is so different and it's good not to have any pre set expectations of how the kids will get along together. It's great when siblings are friends and like each other, but it's never guaranteed and it can't be forced. 

Best of luck to all you future STMs!",93,17,2020-05-03,premature birth
BabyBumps,"Birth story - First baby, positive labor, difficult recovery","Hi babybumps, somehow I let a year go by before posting my own birth story but I always appreciated reading other's experiences so I figured better late than never. I'm not sure if it's worth a content warning, but be forewarned, my recovery was horrible. TL;DR - would have been great if my baby had been a reasonable size. Everything pre-Covid.  


Going way back, I had an overall pretty good pregnancy, but by the last few weeks the kicking baby, swelling extremeties and extra 40-45 pounds wore on me and I started my maternity leave at 40+1. Walking a lot, eating dates, pumping and bouncing on the yoga ball failed to kick things off (sex was totally unappealing for me and my husband) and I went overdue. At 40+5 I had an ultrasound that estimated a big baby, 9 lb 6 oz, but everyone reassured me the estimates are often over and I shouldn't worry. They penciled me in for an induction at the end of the week. Over that week I had a very gradual increase in frequency of Braxton Hicks, and I woke early on 41+0 with slightly stronger contractions that were roughly settling into a regular pattern. I timed them and called the hospital when I thought they were at 5-1-1 and they told me to come and get checked out. Disappointingly, they didn't think the contractions were that serious (in retrospect, I was more hopeful than really believing it was real) and we were sent home to rest before the induction scheduled the next day.  


That night around midnight, while I was sleeping in my pillow nest on the couch, I woke up to a big gushy feeling and knew instantly my water had broken. I gathered up the pad under me and staggered to the bathroom while shouting to my husband to get up, it's haaaappening! I called the hospital from the toilet and they told me to come in right away because the amniotic fluid was a little smelly and had a brown tinge which were signs of meconium. By the time we got changed and threw our toothbrushes back in the go bag the contractions started in earnest and I had to stop and breathe through them. We got to the hospital around 1 AM and I was able to walk into the lobby on my own and wait while my husband parked the car. In the triage room, they got his heartbeat on the monitor right away and it was strong and steady. The nurses reassured me that meconium was only a major worry if the labor is premature since it's not normal for a 36 week fetus to poop, but after 41 weeks, eh, how long could you expect them to hold it? They did warn me there would be extra pediatric staff in the room to make sure he was ok and treat him if he inhaled any, but otherwise not to worry about it.  


Pretty soon after I got in the triage room I got really nauseous and woozy, and there's a bit of a blurry period here where my memory is kind of patchy. I know I threw up, I got changed into a Johnny and mesh undies and they moved me to a delivery room and parked me on a yoga ball next to the bed so I could rest my head on my arms. I tried to focus on trying the pain management techniques we had learned in class, but it was all I could do to roll my hips back and forth on the yoga ball and moan when the contractions hit. Periodically great gushes of amniotic fluid would dump out on the floor and it turns out this was the reason I was feeling so bad, since the loss of pressure from the amniotic fluid was dropping my blood pressure. One nurse told me it was the most fluid she had ever seen come out of someone and they kept having to mop it up so no one would slip - just one of the many gross things we experienced!  


Fortunately, the treatment for the blood pressure issue is mostly IV fluids with some ephedrine (plus I eventually ran out of amniotic fluid) and I got back to normal conciousness levels pretty soon. I requested an epidural and it was placed around 3 AM, after which I felt completely normal again. Seriously, it was great. We napped off and on from then, with a couple of checks which found steady dilation until around 8 AM when I was about 9.5 cm. I guess I stalled at that point, because when they checked me an hour later it was about the same. Around 10 AM I started to involuntarily push with every contraction and even though there was ""a bit of a lip"" they decided it was worse to wait and risk swelling so we got ready for pushing. They set up the leg supports on the bed and started coaching me. My husband held one leg, a trainee nurse held the other and the main nurse tended to the business end of things. It took me a bit to be effective but I tried to push like I was pooping and curl my body around the baby to squeeze him out like toothpaste (someone on baby bumps described pushing this way and I found it a helpful image). I did poop the first couple of pushes but they just cleaned up and changed gloves, it was no big deal.  


I ended up pushing for about two hours. Pushing for a long time was actually something I was very nervous about going in, but it was truly not as bad as I feared. I wasn't writhing and hollering like in a movie; I had a hard job to do and was focused on working on it. It was incredibly taxing though. By the end I started crying out from effort at the end of each push and falling asleep between contractions. My husband would occasionally feed me an ice chip that was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. I started to lose effectiveness from fatigue but I must have been very close because the midwife offered to ""help out with a little cut."" I knew I didn't want that but also the baby really had to get out, so I asked for one more try and on the next contraction gave it every tiny scrap of energy I had in me. I'm not exactly sure what the midwife was doing, but I could feel some uncomfortable fingers digging around and with my resolve and her help we delivered his head and the rest of him quickly followed. They plopped him on my chest and I could barely process his existance because I was so completely wiped out. It was just after noon, roughly 12 hours after my water broke.  


Suddenly there was a flip where my work was over and everyone else started bustling with action. Because of the meconium, the midwife cut the cord right away and the baby was whisked away to be suctioned and checked over. The nurses got to work jabbing my stomach and the midwife started stitching my one medium tear and few little abrasions. This was somehow the most painful part of the whole process and I had to hit the boost button on the epidural for the first time. I heard someone announce the baby was 5000 g and there was some general sounds of amazement. I tried to figure out how much that was in pounds but my brain was too mushy to multiply 5x2.2 (but not so mushy to remember there are 2.2 pounds in a kilogram somehow) so I asked and when they told me 11 lbs I yelled out ""what the FUCK?"" because holy crap, I was not expecting that. Everyone who hadn't just pushed a giant baby out of their body laughed. He was perfect though - APGAR scores of 8 and 9, stable blood sugar (a concern for big babies) and ready to nurse. Once the placenta was out and the stitches were done the room cleared out pretty quickly and we were left alone to rest and get to know each other.  


I would love to say at this point that everything was bonding and sunshine from here out but actually this is when things got really tough for me. I didn't know then, but the delivery stretched the front ligament in my pelvis and it didn't pull back together after, causing a cascade of issues. All I knew was that as the epidural wore off it started to hurt to move my legs and my back began to spasm. I had to inch out of bed with my weight on two nurses to get into a wheelchair to move rooms. If I tried to move too fast or in the wrong way my muscles would lock up and pain would shoot across my pelvis. I could hold my baby in bed but not get up to pick him up so my husband had to do all the changes. The good thing was that I did start to improve steadily after the first day so I could get up and start to walk with a walker to the bathroom (had a catheter until then) by the second day and down the hall and back by the third day when I was discharged. I think the nurses may have thought I was malingering since they were hemming and hawing about discharging me with a walker, but I could not take one step without it so I'm not sure what the plan was. Wheel me out the door and tip me out onto the sidewalk? In any event, I did get a walker and used it every time I stood for a full week, then was able to taper off it.  


I needed so much help. My brother met us at our house after the hospital to help my husband essentially drag me up the steps to get inside. My mom stayed with us for two weeks to take care of the baby and me, less a couple of days when my in laws visited and did the same. My husband did a lot of care and was constantly running errands. I could stand and sit with both feet planted but to get in and out of bed someone needed to pick up my ankles and swing my legs around so I could lie down. We were pretty crappy at breastfeeding at first so I did it as much as I could but ended up also doing a bunch of pumping and bottle feeding. I made a lot of milk but had latch problems, a visit from a lactation consultant helped out but it was a long time before it was smooth. Breastfeeding and my adventures with mastitis (complete with ER visit and hospital admittance) are a whole other saga I won't get into here. I peed on the floor every time I stood up for a while, bled from both nipples and was completely topless in front of many people, including my father in law. Thankfully I got off fairly easy on some other postpartum issues - pooping was no big deal, the bleeding slowed down to normal period levels in a couple of days and my stitches healed really quickly. I figured out that I could avoid peeing myself if I just went every couple of hours instead of waiting to feel the urge but still wore Depends for security.  


I was in weirdly good spirits considering all of this though. In my darkest moments I was angry that this had happened to me and ashamed that I couldn't care for my own baby, but I was also grateful that he was healthy and I had so much support from my family. I worried a lot about bonding because we didn't have that golden mama/daddy/baby trio I imagined for the newborn stage but by 6 months I knew that our bond was not at all damaged by this and it's really strong now. If I have learned anything from this experience it's that babies and families are resiliant and can recover from a lot, and that a difficult beginning does not neccesarily mean difficulties forever.  


My heart goes out to all the bumpers dealing with Covid on top of everything, I wish you all a healthy and safe winter and cross my fingers 2021 will be better.

BabyBumps,"Layla's birth story - induction due to hypertension, no epidural, fast labor.","Birth stories are probably one of my favorite things about this sub. Through all 3 of my pregnancies I read them here constantly. So I feel like I should contribute my own. 


I have 3 kids; my oldest son is 3, my middle daughter is 14 months, and the baby girl is now 1 week old. My first two kids were premature. My son was born at 32 weeks due to a placental infection. He spent 21 days in the hospital. My daughter was born at 34 weeks due to preeclampsia and was released the same day as me. With this pregnancy we did weekly P17 injections from 16 weeks on and I monitored my blood pressure closely in hopes of making it to full term. And we did! Layla was born at 37 weeks 3 days weighing 6 pounds 13 ounces. 


This pregnancy was harder on my body, probably because I've spent the last 3 years constsntly pregnant. Lol. I had pretty bad morning sickness into the second trimester. Lots of aches and pains from the second trimester on. I was fortunate enough to be able to quit my job 3 months before I was due. That really took a lot of stress off my mind and body. 


At 34 weeks I had some high blood pressure reads at home and called the doctor. They told me to come in. My blood pressure was elevated but my lab work came back good. He checked my cervix and I was dilated to a 3 and 75% effaced. He seemed concerned but sent me home. 


The following weeks I was having crazy braxton hicks, my blood pressure was still high, but all my lab work was good. At 36+5 my blood pressure spiked to 180/100 at home and stayed there all day. We went to labor and delivery to be monitored. Eventually my blood pressure leveled out. Bloodwork came back with no indicators of preeclampsia. They prescribed labatelol and told me to make an appointment with my doctor on Monday, which happened to be the 37 week mark. 


At that appointment the doctor checked my cervix again. 5 cm, 90% effaced. He scheduled an induction for 2 days later because of my blood pressure and the fact that I live an hour from the hospital. I'm not gonna lie, I was really really excited. This third pregnancy was not planned. I did not want another baby. And 2020 has been a shit show. So to get to skip the last 3 weeks of pregnancy was pretty great to me. Took the covid test. Packed my bags. 


We arrived for the induction at 4:30 A.M. Wednesday morning. By 6 we had some pitocin in my iv, as well as fluids and potassium because I was deficient. The potassium burned and I had to do 2 bags of it. 


After she got everything going my nurse checked me. Dilated to a 6. She asked me if I wanted the epidural. I told her I'd like to wait and see how it goes, but I really didn't want it. My main reason for not wanting it was getting a catheter. I HATE having a catheter. I find it so uncomfortable. I knew I could probably handle the contractions because with my first kid I was dilated to a 9 by the time we got to the hospital. 


At 8:30 my midwife came in and broke my water to speed things up. I was still at 6 cm. She said she'd be back in a couple hours to check on me. After my water was broken things really heated up. My contractions had been just noticeable before. Now they were about a 6 on the pain scale and started coming very, very close together. I was still able to talk through them but it was getting harder. I asked for a birthing ball to labor on for a while. The nurse brought it in and helped get me situated on it. It helped take my mind off the contractions and I was really thankful I could move around at this point, unlike my other 2 births. 


After about 10 minutes on the birthing ball I told my husband if I wasn't close to pushing I was gonna have to get the epidural. My contractions were getting very intense and I was having to moan through them. I had him call the nurse and asked her to please check me. She helped me back into the bed and quickly checked. Said I was complete. And crowning. I couldn't hold back. There was no waiting for the midwife, a doctor, or any other nurses. My body just started pushing with the next contraction. 


2 other nurses had time to make it in, and then after 3 pushes my baby was born at 9:12 A.M. The nurse caught her. It was the first baby she'd caught and I'm pretty sure she was more scared than me. My midwife came running in at this point and sat down to deliver the placenta. I could feel that whole process much more this time and it was freaky. 


I was bleeding more than they wanted so I got a pill up my butt. Otherwise there were no complications, no tearing, and no trouble. We did a full hour of skin to skin and a while later I was able to walk to the bathroom on my own. 


I did kind of go into a bit of shock, I guess you'd say, which hadn't happened previously. I was freezing cold and couldn't stop shaking. Blood loss, maybe? I'm not sure. It passed pretty quickly. 


We had a 2 night stay in the hospital because I was group b step positive. Fortunately the baby was unaffected. But the extra day away from my older 2 kids was agonizing for me and their father. I constantly feel like I need a break, but when I am not home with them at bedtime it breaks my heart.  


This birth went as well as it possibly could have. My other experiences left me feeling like I somehow should have done more to prevent preterm birth or like my body was just failing me. But this time around, every little wish I had was fulfilled. 


I gave birth to a healthy, full term baby. 

I got to eat less than 3 hours after delivery compared to 62 hours without food in my second delivery.

I didn't spend any time on bedrest. 

I got to have a golden hour with her instead of having my baby wheeled away to the NICU. 

I delivered with no epidural (no catheter!!) and was able to handle the pain. 

We came home together. 


And now I am NEVER having another baby. Lol.",66,12,2020-10-14,premature birth
BabyBumps,"Bumpers, how are you dealing with the holidays?","With the ongoing pandemic, how have your holiday plans changed and how are you dealing with that? 

There have been studies showing that covid during pregnancy leads to increase risk of death, premature birth, miscarriage, and the list goes on. After reading about this, my SO and I (currently 25w0d) decided to be a lot more vigilant on leaving the house (only for groceries and pick up when possible) and who we saw (only other people who didnt go out). However, this means I don't get to see most of my family since they work jobs where they have to interact with people. For Thanksgiving, I didn't get to see my family and that was fine, but with Christmas coming up it is getting hard for me to stick with our plan of not interacting with our loved ones because I really miss them. It also doesn't help that people don't seem to understand or think it's a big deal. 

So I'm curious to hear what my fellow bumpers have planned for the upcoming holidays during the pandemic.",2,15,2020-12-06,premature birth
BabyBumps,"Part I of a Double Feature Birth Story: 2 Positive C-Sections 22 months apart! Breech, Oligohydraminos, Fibroids, NICU, Total Hip Dysplasia"," 

Hello everyone! I’ve been meaning to get around to posting my birth stories at some point, but now I’m about to have baby number THREE and haven’t posted a single one. And apparently this sub needs some more positive C-section birth stories. I had wonderful c-sections and can’t  wait to have another one so I thought I'd share my experiences! Warning: very freaking long.

PS, I should mention that I’m a nurse in the US who has had a series of outpatient jobs, but none of them maternity.

Birth Story #1: Elena the Incorrigible

I got pregnant for the first time in summer 2015. Besides having some mild nausea and food aversions in the first trimester (no scrambled eggs or tea, please!), everything went along as normal until the 20 week anatomy scan. At that scan, they told me that I had two small fibroids on the outer top of my uterus and that they would have to monitor them through Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) for the rest of the pregnancy. okay, cool. More pictures of the peanut I now knew was a little GIRL(!!!!) and had named Elena.

At 24 weeks, the fibroids had grown minimally but no one was concerned and told me they would see me back in 4 weeks. 

At 28 weeks, my husband came with me for our usual scan at MFM. The tech wasn’t particularly talkative, but mentioned Elena was breech position, butt-first, though with plenty of time to move. The fibroids had stayed about the same size. Great. She told us the doctor would check in with us before we left.

MFM doctor came in and confirmed all the above, but let us know she was concerned because the AFI (amniotic fluid) was only an 8. (Normal is considered 5-30 but they don’t like numbers below 10.) Had I had any leaking or gushes of fluid?

Nope. Don’t get me wrong, pregnancy made everything consistently gooey and sweaty down there, but nothing I would consider a spurt of liquid. I’d never even peed while sneezing.

“I’m concerned that you’ve sprung a slow leak. I’m sending you over to the ER to look for premature rupture of membranes (PROM).”

As a first time mom, this freaked me out pretty badly but I tried to stay calm on the outside if only for my husband who was truly flipping his shit. “Are you sure you haven’t been leaking at all?” He kept asking as he drove us 10 minutes to the hospital, his hands shaking. It wasn’t the first or last time I would be asked that question by a long shot…

“No!” I kept insisting. Not for the last time!

We checked in at OB triage and they took me right back as MFM had called ahead and let them know I was coming. They rechecked the AFI and it was even lower at a 7 something. They insisted on checking with a swab to see if my water had broken (“IT HAS NOT BROKEN!”) and it was negative- no PROM. And yet… where the heck was all the fluid?

After a Biophysical Profile (BPP), it was determined that Elena was doing fine. I didn’t seem to have broken my water. It was just… not a great amount. They decided to let me go home, after they gave me a steroid shot in my butt just in case. I’ve heard that, for some people, those shots are super painful, but I just thought it itched a bunch. 

I had to go back in 3 days to MFM again and get checked. AFI was a 9.

Three days later, it was an 8.5.

Four days later, it was a 9.5.

The AFI just never seemed to get above 10. Elena was in no apparent distress and didn’t seem to care if she existed in a teaspoon or a pool. So I kept working at my private physician’s office desk job. My OB encouraged me to hydrate well, although he added that he didn’t think it would make a bit of difference. I did so, gallantly, nevertheless, even though I am a consistently dehydrated person who hates drinking. Ugh.

At 33 weeks, I went in for one of my ultrasounds like usual, though it was at a hospital location and not an outpatient one just due to scheduling. My husband went with me. I was joking around with the tech as I laid down my massive self (thanks for packing 55-60+ lbs on me, Elena…) and felt good as usual. I looked up at the screen to guesstimate the AFI myself, as I was getting quite good at it now with FIVE WEEKS’ WORTH of consistent scans. I was having a hard time seeing her though, as this ultrasound appeared very dark.

“What’s the AFI?” I asked.

“Well…” the tech said slowly. “It’s a bit low. It’s so low that there’s not much fluid for the ultrasound waves to bounce the fluid off of… I’m measuring about a 1.7 over all.”

“What… in one corner?” 

“Nope. Over all. That’s why we can’t see her very well. Have you had any leaking?”

“NO!” my husband and I both answered, a little exasperated. Not for the last time! Sorry, tech. Totally not your fault.

“Well, you’re going over to OB triage and I think they will admit you.”

I was already in the hospital, just on the bottom floor, so they wheeled me upstairs with my husband following in stunned silence. We were both thinking that this was the end of the line and that we were going to be having a baby. Upstairs, they checked for amniotic fluid leaking out AGAIN (negative), checked my cervix (closed), and checked on Elena (blissfully happy in her literal teaspoon of fluid). She was also still breech position. I got another steroid shot just in case. They had a doctor from NICU come up and talk to me about what it would be like to give birth to a 33 week preemie in terms of NICU time and progression.

They let me know that the plan was to keep me overnight, rehydrate me (UGH!) and monitor the both of us for contractions, fluid leakage, anything. The specialist from MFM told me that normally low amniotic fluid without a leak would indicate some sort of placenta problem, but if I had a bum placenta, they would see a few things: less blood flow (nope, it was fine), bleeding (nope, none), a SGA (small for gestational age) baby (not at all, she was 60th%), or some signs of distress in Elena (nope, she was doing all her regular movements, breathing practice, heart rate variability was great, etc). In effect, I was a puzzle.

I ended up staying in the hospital for a week to be monitored. Day by day, the fluid went up by a count of 1-2. For the first 48 hours, I was on an IV of 150mL/hr which was TORTURE as I kept getting up to pee every 30-45 minutes around the clock. I begged my OB to stop it, and he agreed, saying it didn’t really seem to do anything. When it was stopped and I rehydrated normally, the rate of 1-2 increase per day continued, neither accelerating nor stopping. Elena appeared fine.

At the end of the week, the MFM specialist shrugged and was like, “Well… you’re back at 9.5. Baby appears fine. I’m sending you home to keep growing her. No bedrest needed, as that’s not been shown to do anything. Just take it easy and don’t overexert yourself. You can go back to work if you want.”

Me, internally: OH THANK GOD.

I continued to be monitored twice a week. I went to work. 

At 35w6d, I had an appointment at 1pm for another ultrasound. Before the appointment, a drug rep had brought in Chick Fil A for the entire office and I ATE MY PREGNANT LITTLE HEART OUT. I had a sandwich. I had nuggets. I had fries. I had apples. I had some of the lemonade. I’m pretty sure I had a damn cookie too. 

Stuffed happily full, I waddled off to the ultrasound and noted, with my now extremely experienced eye, not too many deep pockets of fluid in that picture. “Uh-oh,” I said to the tech. “It’s below like a 5, isn’t it?”

“Very good,” she said impressed. “Yeah, it’s a 3.2. Might be time for you to have this baby.”

“It’s been lower” was all I said. I didn’t text my husband yet, who was at work. For all I knew, they would send me home…

The MFM specialist came in. “Hello again,” he said cheerfully. “Time for her to come out.”

“What?!” I said. “But… it’s been lower.”

“She’s nearly full term,” he said, “and stayed in weeks longer than we thought. She’s being born today before this low fluid causes problems we can’t fix.” I knew what he meant.

Luckily, this was another already-at-the-hospital appointment, so they wheeled me over to pre-op. As we went, I called my husband.

“Hey, how are you?” He gave me some story about work drama. “Oh, cool. Hey, ready to have a baby?” He blurted out, “Are you fucking serious?!” and made very fast plans to meet me at the hospital. 

Pre-op, you say? Didn’t she turn? Nah. Stinker was still breech. At this point, my OB had explained to me that he didn’t think she would turn herself and she was a poor candidate for ECV simply because she had NO fluid in there. No wiggle room. It was too tight for her or outside forces to turn her. They had also given up trying to guess her weight sometime around 33 weeks because the tip of her femur was jammed down so far in my pelvis that they literally couldn’t measure it. Best guesses were 4.5 to 6lb.

A nurse came in and gave me some information, gave me a third steroid injection, then informed me I was now NPO (nothing by mouth) for the next few hours and then we could have a c-section. As a nurse myself, I knew 4 hours was NOT enough time to clear my stomach/upper GI tract of everything I had eaten. Ugh.

“Um, I did have lunch,” I said.

“No problem,” she waved her hand dismissively. “A sandwich and some chips isn’t a big deal.”

“No… I had a very big lunch,” I confessed, and then I had to list out everything I ate. By the time I was done, she was laughing, wrote “high fat meal” on my chart and now I had to wait EIGHT hours. ;\_; No one to blame but myself. 

Probably by about 7 hours in, I was starving. It was now 8-9pm at night and I couldn’t have anything. We would have been about ready to go but a few emergencies had piled up ahead of me. After all, neither Elena nor I were in distress. I got a message from my OB (who was in surgery) via nurse: “Do you want to go home, have something to eat, get some sleep, and I’ll see you first thing in the morning for the c-section? Or do you want to wait 2 more hours and we’ll get you in on the end of the schedule?”

“I am NOT leaving this hospital without a baby on the outside,” I informed the nurse, and she carried the message back. And so we waited.

Finally, around 11:30pm, they started to get me prepped. My husband went to get changed into scrubs and they took my stretcher into the OR. They had me curl forward to get the epidural, and I was a little nervous for what that would feel like, but it was the easiest thing ever. I felt the most minor sting and then my feet and legs started to go pins and needles. They laid me back and started strapping me up with things, putting up the drape, putting in my catheter I guess (although I couldn’t see or feel that), etc. The anesthesiologist sat right by my head on the right and my husband soon joined me sitting on a stool on my left.

For some reason, the thought of the initial incision really freaked me out. As a nurse, I do NOT like to see the first cut of anything in a surgery. Once someone’s insides are open, it’s fine, but I hate that initial slice. Imagining that in myself definitely got to me. My husband talked me down and distracted me really well, and eventually the anesthesiologist was like “That part is over with! You’re already open!” and I felt better. Counterintuitive maybe, lol, but true. I did feel a little nauseated at that point, so I let him know and he pushed something in my IV that took the feeling away instantly. Good.

There was a ton of pulling and pushing as Elena really was JAMMED down in my pelvis ass-first. Great plan, kid. When they pulled her out, she screamed as loud as her little steroid-juiced lungs could muster (frankly, very loudly) and they took her over to the warmer to check her out with the NICU team, since full term is considered 37 weeks and now at 11:50pm, she was still technically 35w6d. She passed her apgars with flying colors though she was all folded up like an accordion due to her consistent breech position. I was shaking from the anesthesia and couldn’t hold onto her very well so I had my husband hold her near my head and we just marveled at how beautiful she was.

Spoiler: she grew into a cute baby but did look a tad underdeveloped from being technically a late term preemie. We didn’t notice at the time. I only know from looking at her first pictures now, 4.5 years later. Haha.

Impressively, she weighed 5lb 14oz! Definitely not SGA. They inspected the placenta but it looked totally normal. No one ever was able to solve the fluid mystery. Oh well. They finished closing me up and wheeled me back to recover in PACU holding my little pumpkin in my arms. With the help of a nurse, Elena latched on and fed for about 20 minutes before falling asleep. They warned me she might be a little sleepy because she was a late-term preemie and to wake her at least every 2 hours to try to latch her on. 

Once I was deemed stable, they moved the two of us to a hospital room. It was about 2:30am at that point. I was feeling no pain. Actually, I was the most comfortable I had been in WEEKS, with the epidural still running, a catheter in so that I didn’t have to pee, and no baby on the inside to squish my organs. I felt fantastic. And exhausted. My nurse told me that because Elena was early, they needed to monitor her blood sugars in the special on-floor nursery for a few hours and then they would bring her back.

I said that was fine. My nurse let me have a few crackers and some apple juice, which tasted absolutely amazing, and then I proceeded to have the BEST FOUR HOUR NAP OF MY LIFE. Oh man. I woke up from that thing feeling like a new person. I hadn’t slept 4 hours without pain or having to pee in months. This is still my favorite memory from Elena’s birth experience.

In terms of c-section recovery, it felt easy as pie. My nurse took out the catheter probably about 6-8 hours post-surgery and I got up and walked to the bathroom. I had a bowel movement with no issues. My pain was maybe a 4/10 tops? It wasn’t bad at all. Pregnancy had hurt worse! The only thing that really annoyed me were my feet, which had swollen from the IV fluids and persisted to be annoyingly huge for about a week after birth. They were the worst part.

After taking Toradol via IV for the first 48 hours, I stuck to ibuprofen 600mg every 6 hours around the clock for the first week and that made a huge difference. I really had very minimal pain as long as I didn’t forget a dose. Days 2-3 were the ones I was the most sore. At a week, I found I had to stop taking ibuprofen because, if I did, my pain was literally zero and I would end up doing too much and feel extremely sore from it later. I was able to do a short loop around our neighborhood with Elena at about 1.5 to 2 weeks out from surgery and taking no medication at all and things got even easier from there.  I probably only bled until the 2-3 week mark and none of it was heavy. For the first week, it was a normal period and then just spotting. By 5 weeks, I had sex and it was fantastic. As a nurse, I don’t recommend that, what a terrible idea, wait until your 6 week post-op appointment. : )

Unfortunately, Elena had her own issues. We struggled with breastfeeding because Elena was, apparently, what they call the typical late term “sneaky” preemie. They appear to do great with adjusting to life at first… and then not so much. She was latching but not well and her suck reflex was AWFUL. We tried the SNS (supplemental nursing system) and tons of other techniques, but couldn’t seem to feed her well from me. I was fine with using formula and we did give her some of that via SNS and bottle nipple.

It all peaked around 72 hours of life, just as we were getting ready to go home. They had taken Elena out of the room to try to pass her car seat test. She de-satted after about 40 minutes (and they have to make it an hour and a half!), so the nurse took her out but she continued crying, so the nurse went to feed her some formula… and with the pulse ox on from the car seat test, she could see that Elena’s oxygen saturation levels went down into the 70s while she was actively sucking. She’d come out ready to latch and suck, but apparently didn’t know how to breathe while she did so. NICU time.

Elena ended up spending Thursday night to Monday afternoon in the NICU. She was the biggest, least machine-connected kid there, which was nice to see. It was so hard to be discharged home Thursday without her and broke my heart. I was pumping around the clock for her (see separate previous comment history for why that crap didn’t work… too long to add into this long birth story already). Really, she just went to the NICU to be allowed to mature a few more days while being monitored. It was such a relief to take her home on Monday (after she DID finally pass the damn car seat test). 

It was only the next day that we had our first appointment with the hip specialist… oh, did I mention that? ;\_; There are five risk factors for total hip dysplasia and Elena had all of them: first time mom, female baby, breech position, low fluid, and family history (an aunt and a cousin on my dad’s side). On ultrasound at 3 days old, it was revealed that her hips were COMPLETELY dislocated. Not just loose in the joint. Totally. Out.

So at one week of age, about 37 gestational weeks, Elena was fitted into the TINIEST Pavlik harness you have ever seen. She wore it full time for about four months and, luckily for us, it completely resolved the hip dysplasia with no need for surgery. She walked at 14 months, not even delayed. On xray at 18 months, her hips showed continued normal development and she continues to be a normal 4.5 year old today who is in the 95% for height, stomps furiously when angry, loves to use karate kick moves on her brother, and jumps off way-too-high playground equipment. Oh, and who loves to tell anyone who asks about her birth that ""I wanted to come out of mommy butt-first, teeheehehehe.""

As you can see… the c-section was great and the least of the troubles with my firstborn! My surgery went perfectly- she was the one who was a hot mess. Haha. I hope this relieves the fears of anyone who needed to hear a positive c-section experience! I’m happy to answer any questions you may have if you comment below. Tomorrow, I will try to post a second positive c-section story, this one from my son- a very different baby!

TLDR: Oligohydraminos, breech position, hospital stay, fantastic c-section, sneaky preemie, pumping around the clock is terrible, hip dysplasia. /end",46,11,2020-11-01,premature birth
BabyBumps,Boundaries for boundary stomping MIL?,"My husband and I trying and recently had a conversation about if we get pregnant and who would be in the room for the actual birth. I don’t want anyone to even know I’m at the hospital until after we are home and comfortable except for husband and my family. He agreed, but mentioned how badly his parents will take this, especially if my mom gets to be in the room. For their other grandchildren they were in the room through the birth or waiting in the waiting room overnight and then stayed with the new parents to “help” (but really just hold baby instead of clean/cook). I’ve seen how my MIL’s countless boundary stomps go unchecked by my sisters-in-law and worry how things might escalate with the golden child (my husband). They range from small comments when she doesn’t agree with something to invasions of privacy to full blown not listening to the parents rules and doing whatever she wants with zero consequences. Neither sister stands up to her. My husband doesn’t really either unless he absolutely has to- he normally just leaves the room or hangs up the phone. If it is important, he stands his ground, but then feels guilty after. 


While it is a little premature, I’ve started a list of boundaries to talk about with my husband so we are on the same page. I’m worried if we don’t talk early enough, things will progress and I’ll have little backup if things get heated. I’m wondering if anyone could share advice or add things I might now even be thinking of. So far my list is:


-Anyone who wants to be around future baby must be up to date on vaccinations(my in laws are vaccinated, but embrace the ideas behind anti-vax - so I’m concerned about boosters) 


-No sharing photos of personal information on social media (my MIL shares EVERYTHING on FB and will vague post about anything that upsets her, making herself the hero/victim of whatever situation) 


-No one will be at the hospital or staying with us. We can have visitors for short spurts a few (days? Weeks?) after birth. 


-No unmonitored time (aka they will never be alone with any kids of ours) - this was my husband’s request before we even got married and I second it. I have no idea how we communicate that without all of my in-laws blowing up at us and making me out to be the bad guy. They think they are the perfect family and the best grandparents ever, so telling them otherwise would be devastating for them. 


If you set any hard rules like this, how did you communicate boundaries with your in-laws? I know the excitement comes from a place of love and I want to embrace that. I also want to keep future baby safe. Our last attempt at communicating boundaries around the holidays went horribly, with my MIL screaming insults at us and crying that we’ve ruined holidays forever and that her son might as well be dead because he doesn’t love her or his sisters. My husband just shut down during the convo and we did what we wanted (though he felt extremely guilty) and after a month of guilting the fight was rugswept by my in-laws. The process was unproductive to say the least. I definitely need advice on this. Thanks for any help!",4,18,2020-05-27,premature birth

Also, this is my third pregnancy in three years (the first ended in a TFMR at 20 weeks) and I'm concerned about complications or low birth weight or premature birth from my pregnancies being so close to each other.

BabyBumps,"Birth story: 13 days overdue, long time early labour but quick delivery. Mostly unmedicated, very positive.","So my LO is almost 8 months old but I'm finally getting round to posting my birth story!

My due date was 14/09/2019. My due date came and went, I had multiple midwife appointments, and a couple of sweeps. On Wednesday 25th September I had the midwife come round for one final sweep. If this didn't work then I was going to be induced on Friday 27th. 

By this point I was trying every trick in the book to try and get labour started but felt no different. Then on Thursday evening I kept having twinges. I was so fed up by this point, that I think I was in denial about it but my partner was keeping track of my contractions. 

By 7pm my contractions were every 20 minutes. By 11pm they were every 5 minutes. We cared the hospital and was told to wait it out. At about 1am on Friday we went to the hospital as my contractions were coming thick and fast but as soon as I went in the room to be examined, they slowed right down and I was only 2cm so got sent home. All night my contractions were very strong and I sat at home in the bath until they were lasting about a minute each. We went back to the hospital at about 6am only to be sent home again because I was still only 2cm. 

Then at about 11am, my contractions were now lasting longer than the gap inbetween them and I was struggling to cope at home. But when I was checked in the hospital, I was only 3cm! The midwife explained that they believed my body was struggling because I was so tired and that if I wanted, they could give me some pethidine to help me get some rest. 

I originally hadn't wanted pethidine due to it transferring through the placenta but I was so exhausted that I changed my mind. This was given to me at about 12pm. I laid down on some cushions and got some rest for a couple of hours. 

After the pethidine had worn off, my contractions were back with a vengeance so the midwives gave me gas and air. 

I started feeling like I needed to push and so my partner went and got a midwife. They told me I wasn't due to be checked and probably didn't need to push yet. I insisted I really felt like I needed to push and so she checked me. 

To her shock, I was 9cm. She got my partner to push the emergency button and two more midwives entered the room just as my waters broke. 

(My mum entered the room shortly after this as I got my partner to call her after the pethidine wore off. I was convinced I was still only 3 or 4cm because of how slow it had been and wanted some extra support dealing with the pain)

From there it all happened very fast. I quickly went to 10 and was pushing. I'm not sure exactly how log I was pushing for but my baby shot into the room at 15:51 on 27/09. 

Baby was passed to me and my partner in a towel which we unwrapped to discover we had a beautiful baby girl! My partner cut the cord and LO very quickly found the breast and started feeding.

I didn't have the injection to quicken the delivery of the placenta but it was only about 15 minutes later that I delivered the placenta anyway. 

I had minimal blood loss, but I did have a couple of nasty tears where baby came out so quickly. And honestly the stitches hurt more than the delivery in my opinion. 

All in all, it didn't go exactly to my birth plan but was very positive. Baby waited right until the last minute to make an appearance and then came very quickly!",25,2,2020-05-10,early delivery
BabyBumps,HR Manager called the Doctor,"I was diagnosed with an insufficient cervix about a month ago at 26 weeks. My doctor sent me to a specialist to get a second opinion who confirmed that I am at risk for preterm delivery.  


I just had a follow up with my doctor Friday where he asked me about my activity and was surprised to hear that I am still working full time. My job isn’t super strenuous but I am constantly getting up and walking around all day and it’s exhausting. He immediately wrote me a doctors note that it is his medical recommendation that I start working from home starting at the end of August. My particular job cannot be done at home but there are many side projects that the company needs done that I can work on from a laptop.  

I have been very forthcoming with HR about all of this and they let me know that even if there are no work from home options, that I can start short term disability early. Today my nurse called me and said she has a voicemail from my HR manager asking for an exact medical reasoning behind me needing to work from home. She said of course that she cannot give out this information because of HIPPA and that she was very surprised that an HR manager asked to begin with considering its not really allowed? I feel like an HR manager should know about HIPPA and I feel like calling was a huge invasion of privacy. I gave her a note and I even explained the insufficient cervix to her! It’s not like I’ve been shady about any of this.  

My nurse is amazing and said that she won’t even tell my HR manager that we spoke and will just tell her point blank that she is not going to release that information.

I know the risks are low of having to have the baby due to complications with the procedure. 37 weeks is considered full term.

BabyBumps,72 hour failed induction leading to emergency c section and nicu stay. Traumatic experience. (very long post),"Ok I will start by saying baby is doing ok and will be in the nicu only until the morning hopefully! She was 8.11lbs and 20 inches long born 07/29/2020 at 6:45pm via c section. Unfortunately I have not been able to see or hold her at all yet and it's been 10 hours. :(

Also this is all very fresh so it will be extremely detailed, sorry in advance for long post, this is mainly for myself to record what baby's birth was like. 

So my induction started at 38+3 weeks, this last Sunday at 8 pm because of pre-eclampsia. I was 1cm dilated but cervix was very thick. They started me on cervadil for 24 hours. Was still at 1cm but cervix thinned a little bit. They then started me on pitocin for 12 hours and at first it was just mildly uncomfortable like a 2/10 on passion scale but probably felt like 5/10 towards the end of it.

 Again only 1cm no real progress, so they have me 3 rounds of cytotek. That got me to 2cm and thinned my cervix pretty well. At that point they decided to manually break my waters and holy hell was it painful! I was informed that fluid was tinged green meaning baby had her first bowel movement in the amniotic fluid which if she breathed in during birth she'd need the nicu. I immediately asked for an epidural afterwards because the contractions really ramped up. It took an hour for the anesthesiologist to come give me the epidural and I was in moderate pain like 6/10 from contractions. The epidural was not as bad as I thought it would be, they numb you with a needle in your spine first which stings and burns a bit. Then you feel a weird pressure but I also got weird electrical shocks to my sciatic nerve but they didn't seem concerned. 

I started to get some relief but only when I laid on my back but the nurses kept insisting I turn to my sides and when I would the epidural would immediately wear off. Not normal. So finally they let me stay on my back for a bit and have me a ""bolus"" which is like extra meds for pain which helped and I got 3 blissful hours of sleep until I woke up shivering! So I call the nurse in and let her know and she sees I'm visibly shivering takes my temperature and it was 99, not quite high enough to concern them so she just gave me an extra blanket. I tried to sleep some more but I started to feel my contractions through the epidural (not terribly but shouldn't feel it at all) plus still shivering so she came in periodically to check temp. I hit 100.6 so she called the Dr to ask if she should start antibiotics but he only prescribed Tylenol. They waited an hour after Tylenol to see if it broke my fever but nope, reached 102.4 and it was beginning to affect baby's heart rate which was around 140 before the fever and rose to 175 after fever. 

They finally started me on 3 antibiotics to cover all bacterial infections that might have occurred from cervical checks, the catheter or amniotic fluid rupture. It was at this time the contractions were ramping up again slowly becoming more painful. I informed the nurse and asked her to check if my epidural was still ok. She said the tape had rolled but that it still looked ""OK"" and tried to top off the epidural. Spoiler alert: it was NOT ""ok"". And I was fully feeling contractions and was at 7cm at this point. The nurse said she tried to call the anesthesiologist (don't ask me why she waited so long, since I was already crying and groaning from pain?) but that he was in with a c section and it would be an hour. It took 2 hours and at this point I was mentally cursing these nurses to hell for letting me reach this point. 

Finally he comes and said that my epidural had fully come out and he had to redo it. He does it and gives me a strong dose and I feel immediate relief and all was well again. He remarks that my epidural bag was low and he'd be back in an hour to replace it and i jokingly said please don't forget me! He said the dose he gave me should last 2 hours and not to worry because he'd be right back. I fell asleep and woke up an hour and a half later from painful contractions. Guess who was forgotten about? So again I call the nurse and explain the bag is empty and the anesthesiologist was supposed to get me a refill and WHERE THE HELL IS HE?! She said she'd check. ""Oh no he just started another c section"" I immediately started bawling at this news. I'm at 9 cm and fully feeling the contractions at full force. 

2 hours of this passes and my fever won't break (I think from stress) I'm shivering I'm feeling the worst pain I ever felt and my baby's heart rate is 180 getting dangerous. Anesthesiologist finally comes back and he's profusely apologizing but also just blaming the nurse saying she should have reminded him and jokingly said ""please don't leave this in my review"" unfortunately I was not joking mood and couldn't forgive him at that point. He again gave me a strong dose of wasn't as immediate as the last one, took a good 20 minutes to fully numb again and he went and came back 30 min later to refill the bag. So finally comfortable again but zero energy because I had gotten a total of 7 hours of sleep in a 48 hour period they decided it was time to start pushing.

 They said I was doing a great job pushing for the first hour and could feel her head but energy depleted and baby felt like she was going back up. So Dr decided emergency c section because we were hitting the 24 hour mark since water rupture and baby's heart had been too high for too long. Got prepped for surgery, got numbed up really well and literally 30 minutes later I hear her cry and I just start crying because it was finally over and id finally meet my baby girl. Well they get her all cleaned, tested and my husband got to hold her he tried to show her to me but I started to pass out from exhaustion I just couldn't keep my eyes open. They had my husband go with the baby to the nicu while I was patched up took another hour but I slept through it. 

They say baby needs antibiotics and other testing so I shouldn't expect to see her until tomorrow morning. Dr tells me I would have never been able to push baby out because my pelvis was blocking her and she was coming out the wrong way which confused me because the nurse who was having me push said she felt her head and hair. She apologized and said she THOUGHT that's what she felt.

 So basically just a pattern of what felt like negligence/incompetence which sucks because outside of these issues these were very nice people but because of everything I just really hate them lol
If I could turn back time I would've just opted for c section and been home by now instead of having what is now going to be a 5 day hospital stay but felt pressure from family and friends to try vaginally. 
Also don't let anyone brush off anything you're feeling! This entire pregnancy I had a habit of letting Dr's and nurses brush me off as being sensitive or overreacting because I am anxious. If they had taken me seriously every time I brought something up I wouldn't have to look back on this birth as traumatizing. I always wanted 2 children but because of this experience I'm terrified at the thought. Anyways thanks for reading if you got this far, hope you have better experiences when it comes time for your little ones!",69,26,2020-07-30,NICU stay

BabyBumps,I had my daughter 5 months ago. I just came her to share a bit and say ALWAYS TRUSY YOUR BODY. It's because of someone's misfortune and heartbreak sharing on here that my daughter and I are alive.,"I had a very rough pregnancy. Very high risk with lots of complications. I also have very bad medical anxiety and fear I'm wasting doctors time and that what if I'm faking and just don't know it?


I had gone to the hospital 20+ times at 34 weeks. Mostly for real issues. Had actually been admitted for a few days a few times.


Well I had just left the hospital on a Friday and started not feeling right Saturday evening. Sunday morning a poor mother shared her story of not trusting her body and unfortunately losing her child. She was sharing awareness for other moms and I am beyond thankful for her.


She was having a lot of the same issues as me.


Didn't feel baby moving, bad headache, and just a bad feeling.


So I called my ob, told her I was coming in something didn't feel right I hadn't felt baby girl move in over 12 hours. Called my husband to leave work early and come get me because I was too lightheaded to even walk by then.


We get in, my blood pressure is through the roof, my protein is up, my uric acid is up, and they are having a really hard time finding baby. My ob stopped by and told me ""you're a ticking time bomb. I can't send you home"" so I stayed overnight. The next morning my favorite nurse who I knew a bit by then, came in super sad. Informed me she was really sorry but my numbers were rapidly going up. I was going to be induced. We started including at exactly 35 weeks.


I had gone from risky blood pressure to full blown pre E overnight. It took 3 days to get me to dilate. When I started pushing and got baby girls head out I had my ob scream at me to stop pushing. Turns out baby girl had wrapped her cord around her next a few times and that's why her heart beat was down, and she wasn't moving a lot. Thankfully after almost 4 weeks in the nicu she got to come home, and now we have a happy semi healthy 5 month old spit fire.


However if that post wouldn't have convinced me it was better to waste a doctors time and be wrong than not go in and be right, both my daughter and I would be dead. Mama's, listen to your body. Listen to your instincts. Even if you nothing outwardly is wrong if you KNOW something is up go in.


Stay safe. Stay healthy. Stay excited.


And to that mama, who posted on like June 4th or 5th in so sorry for your loss, but thank you so so so much for sharing. I will literally never forget you.",1861,93,2020-11-21,NICU stay

BabyBumps,"Graduated 7 Oct 2020, Trigger Warning, NICU stay, positive outcome","Tl;dr My son was born not breathing on his own, nicu stay to see if brain damage occurred, clean MRI and a 100% healthy baby boy! Traumatic birth in a way, but my boy is just fine! Named James Corbin <insert last name>

On Monday the sixth, I got home from a routine OB apt at about 1230,and when I stood up from my car, I thought my water broke as a gush of warm liquid soaked my jeans. I went inside and asked my husband how he felt about having a baby, and he smiled, all excited like I was. I called the hospital and let them know that I thought my water had broken, so they advised that I come in, provided my contractions were reflecting labor. So far as I could tell, they were, even though they weren't painful in any way. We got to the hospital around 1545 and they put me into triage to check my vitals and see if my water had indeed broken. About two hours later, they determined that my water hadn't broken, but I had developed gestational hypertension, so, me being full term, they highly advised that I go through with induction. I asked my husband what he thought and he said that we should do whatever I was comfortable with, so, we did the induction.

At 2300, they attempted to insert the balloon into my cervix, aaaand it didn't work. I had a panic attack and nearly fainted when they tried, so, they gave me some time to calm down and see if I would dilate some more. I was at 1cm at the time. 0300 rolls around and they decided to give it another go, this time giving me some IV pain meds, (fentanol) and were successful. I had the balloon in for 12 hrs, high as a kite the entire time, until they took it out at 1500. Literally seconds later, my water broke! Dude that's an intense feeling lol they told me I still had 1cm to go until they'd give me an epidural, and let me tell you... That was the longest half hour of my life. I wouldn't wish that pain on my worst enemy. They started pitocin right away, and in 30 mins I was 4cm, and they administered the epidural. From 1600 until 0100, I slept like the dead, and woke up to the feeling of needing to push. Even with the epidural, I could feel the pressure; unfortunately for me, the nurse call button had fallen to the floor, and my hubby was fast asleep, despite my throwing pillows at him lol I waited an hour before taking my heart rate monitor off of my finger to get them to come into the room, which they did quickly. Hubby woke up as the nurse was checking me, and I was at 10cm and more than ready to push! At 0200, I started to push; it honestly felt like the blink of an eye, looking back on it, but an hour and 17 minutes later, my son was born. Two pushes before, I vaguely recall looking at my husband and saying ""you have to get him out!"" My husband told me that he could see my sons head and that I was almost there, and within two pushes, BOOM! There he was! The nurse threw him up on my stomach, and I swear, time just stopped... She yelled ""floppy baby!"" and then several nurses were on him, rubbing at him, trying to get him to breathe. He was taken from me before I could say hello.. Honestly, I can't even begin to describe how that moment felt. It was like the world narrowed to a pinpoint that was him, and then stopped. A whole nicu staff was on him in an instant, trying to get him to breathe and then intubating him and taking him to the nicu. My husband went with them while the docs and nurses worked to get my placenta out and control the bleeding. I honestly have never sincerely thought about punching another adult more in my life than I did in that moment, feeling not only the pain of them pushing on my stomach to remove my placenta, but their perceived disregard for my son. I don't really remember much from that point, I do know they wheeled me to the post partum unit, and my husband and I slept for a while, then a doc came in and explained that my boy was what they called a ""cooling baby."" They put him on a special cooling mat that kept his temperature ~5° below normal body temp in order to minimize any potential damage caused by the brief lack of oxygen. Cue the longest week of my life.. For 72 hrs, I had to watch my baby boy on a cooling mat, shivering and sluggish, unable to do a damn thing to help him. I really can't describe that sort of pain, and I pray that no one else has to go through it. The level of completely useless that I felt was bone deep.. I swear that being able to pump and build up a good store of milk for him once he came off of the mat was the only thing that kept me sane. His father and I spent the entire 72 hrs without sleeping, and it honestly took its toll. I began having nightmares and such.. But, my baby began making leaps and bounds right away. The day after he was admitted, the RN said he would be taken off of the intubation tube the next day, and he progressed fast enough to have it taken out a day early. After 72 hrs on the cooling mat, he waited another two days to get an MRI to rule out any potential brain damage that the lack of oxygen may have caused. Once again, there was nothing at all wrong. My son is 100% healthy and perfect! All we're waiting on is for him to get the hang of eating consistently by himself to take him home.

When I imagined my birth plan, honestly a nicu visit was the furthest thing from my mind. A lot of his birth is a blur, but when I try to recall it, I break down into hysterical tears. Tbh, I was always uncertain as to just what birth trauma was, but now that I've been through it, I totally get it. I panic and everything whenever I think about it, bawling until someone can talk me down from everything. The docs all give him a 100% clean bill of health, and we're just waiting for him to get the hang of eating consistently on his own, and then he can come home! After a week of prayer and many, many tears, plus the most dedicated team of docs and nurses I've ever encountered, my son is perfectly healthy on all fronts. God bless the team who has looked over him and nursed him into full health!! I'll post an update as soon as he's home, which will, God willing, be this weekend!!",21,5,2020-10-16,NICU stay

BabyBumps,Anomaly at the anatomy scan: on the other side,"At our anatomy scan we got devastating news - a serious heart defect, commonly associated with chromosomal abnormalities. My heart sank. We were offered a late termination. My world collapsed. The next 10 days were a blur, we met with a foetal cardiologist interstate and he did a foetal echocardiogram, I had amniocentesis done and we anxiously awaited the results. We had so many questions that couldn’t really be answered. How long is he likely to live? Will he be able to play and run around with his friends? What will his quality of life be? Should we put him through this? Should we put ourselves through this? We’re both young and healthy, we could ‘try again’. 

Ultimately we decided to have our little boy. He was born in January and his welcome was far from routine. He was born, I fell even further in love - more in love than I thought possible (how cliche). He was airlifted to another city with his Daddy while I had to stay behind. I cried myself to sleep, alone, listening to the cries of other people’s babies, knowing he was probably out there crying for me, but I couldn’t be there to comfort him. He had a procedure done. I cried because I couldn’t be there to hold him. We were reunited. We were transferred back. We spent a week in the nicu. He was started on a new medication. We came home for a week. He was breathing funny. We went back to the nicu for another week. He was started on another medication. We came back home. 

We cruised along for a while until we were told it was time for surgery. He was only 2 months old. The surgery. Open heart. The ‘complete’ repair. Hopefully the first and last. We met the surgeon and were blown away by her competency. He was in safe hands.

I took him in at 7am. Only one parent was allowed at the hospital. I held him through the admission questions. He smiled and charmed the pants off everyone. They came to take him away. He smiled and I smiled back while I died inside. The day was torture, there is no other way to put it. We played animal crossing and tried to put it out of our mind. All I could think about was them slicing him open and pulling apart his ribs. It hit 3pm. We should have heard something by now. I called up. Still nothing. ‘Just wait, we will call you back when he arrives in picu’. I stopped coping. Surely there was a reason it was taking longer. What went wrong?

Finally we got the call and went to talk to the surgeon. It went as well as it could have possibly gone. We went to see him. He was covered in drains and lines and ecg tabs and a ventilator. The room was filled with doctors and nurses. I thought it would feel confronting to see him like that but I was just so happy to see him. He still looked like himself underneath everything. 

Recovery seemed slow but in reality it was quite fast. 6 days later we left hospital and came home. He has been a bit more clingy and cranky than usual. But he is still himself. He has started laughing and it melts my heart. He is doing really well and they think he won’t need another surgery. They think he will be able to run around with his friends without getting breathless.

I know not everyone will have it as easy as we did. We might have more to come, but then again so could any child. I know not everyone would make the same decision as us. It was the hardest decision we have ever had to make, and it’s so incredibly personal.

BabyBumps,"I Graduated 3 months early - Jameson was born June 28th, at 26 weeks (mostly positive)","Hey everyone, TLDR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

I figured I share my story now that things have calmed down a bit.  I went into preterm labor at 25+4 and had a baby 4 days later. Aside from having a baby in the NICU, my story is mainly positive so read on if you like. **This isn't meant to scare anyone** by any means, but for the love of God - trust your gut people. I was partially in denial but thank GOD I went in when I did or else I probably would have given birth in my bed.  (Back Story: check out my post history to read about how I did in fact lose my mucus plug and it wasn't just ""an abnormal amount of /abnormal discharge like my OB thought.) 

&#x200B;

**June 24th:** I had some cramping and chalked it up to sleeping weird/braxton hicks. It started around 3-4 am but kind of went away during the day.  Around 6 pm that night it started back up and by 10 pm I was concerned. I had also been spotting on and off all week so..red flag! I called labor and delivery and they said to come in.  

&#x200B;

**June 25th:** We got to the hospital around 12 am and the charge nurse checked me....surprise, I was 5cm dilated with a ""bulging water bag""! Everything happened extremely fast at that point. They immediately put me on a magnesium sulfate drip to slow down/stop the contractions paired with another pill to do the same thing.  They also gave me a steroid shot to help baby's lungs develop more/quicker and started me on antibiotics and IV. I got settled into a L&D room and talked to a few different doctors, nurses, neonatologist, etc to kind of game plan what would happen should I go into labor. This all happened by like 3-4 am. For the rest of the morning/day/night I was super out of it because the magnesium drip made me high as a kite.

&#x200B;

**June 26th:** They gave me the second and final steroid shot and weaned me off of some of the magnesium because it was too much for me. I was so confused and disoriented and felt like I couldn't move or breath. Once they lowered my dosage I felt a lot better. I couldn't eat either but they allowed me liquids, though I did puke them up eventually. Drugs are fun!  We watched lots of TV, mainly the Harry Potter marathon that was on syfy. 

&#x200B;

**June 27th:** They stopped the magnesium drip \~24 hours after the second steroid shot. It's not meant to be a long term solution - just long enough to make sure I got the steroid shots and then it was up to my body to decide what it felt like doing. I was eventually weaned off the other pill as well and taken off antibiotics and the IV drip and the day/night was relatively calm. I could eat again! 

&#x200B;

**June 28th:** We spent most of the early morning hours listening to some poor girl give birth - she was quite loud and it felt like hours. My theory is her labor moans must have flipped some switch in me because my contractions started up again. I started freaking out because I didn't want to give birth in the middle of the night. Up until then, I felt much more comfortable with the day shift nurses than the night shift and I just didn't want to do it. I managed to keep him in.  At some point the next morning I had an ultrasound and baby was still head down so natural birth was the way to go. 

&#x200B;

Throughout the afternoon and into the evening my contractions kept getting stronger and the OB checked my cervix. I was now 7cm dilated. They offered me an epidural which I opted for. In hindsight I have mixed feelings about getting it but I'm a baby when it comes to pain and the last 3 days were exhausting so the less I felt at that point, the better. The contractions started speeding up around 8pm and I was feeling that ""pressure"" to poop so the OB came in to talk to me. We decided that rather than wait for my water to break, we would ""control"" the environment and she'd break it herself. That way we could make sure the NICU team was ready as well. 

Around 8:30 or 8:45 we started. The OB broke my water and...the contractions stopped! We (about 12 of us in the room) all sat in the **MOST AWKWARD SILENCE** of my life (while I was spread eagle mind you) for what felt like hours (probably 4-6 mins) and then my OB was like""...welp...why don't you just try pushing?"" So I beared down and pushed my little guy out sans contractions at 8:56pm. 

He was born 2 lbs 3 oz and a little under 15 inches long. He was making noise when he came out which let me breath a small sigh of relief. I kept asking if he was okay and everyone said he looked great, they even let my husband cut his umbilical cord before they brought him up to the NICU. 

After all the theatrics, I was cleaned up and we were brought to postpartum. I learned how to pump and after a couple hours the neonatologist came in to talk to us. She explained he came out in great shape all things considered and what the variety of different machines/wires/tubes meant.  (If anyone is familiar with NICU verbiage, he was on CPAP, 21% oxygen, antibiotics, etc but nothing major).

**June 29th:** So the NICU rules at my hospital are only the parents can visit and you can't go at the same time. So around 1:30am they let my husband go see him. Around 2 am they wheelchaired me up and I got to meet him. It was surreal to say the least. We spent the next couple of days in postpartum recuperating and were quickly discharged.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. He's 29 weeks gestation and tomorrow he'll be 3 weeks old, and he's doing great! He's gaining weight, he's now 2 lbs 9 oz, 15 inches. They've taken him off some of the IVS/PICC line support he was originally getting and is now just on CPAP. One of us can do Skin to Skin for \~3 hours a day and he's eating my milk and making slow and steady progress. He can even wear clothes soon! We're obviously not out of the woods yet, but I feel like a completely different person than I did when I went into the hospital to find out I was probably going to give birth 3 months early. The nurses and doctors are so supportive, my friends have been great and I even have a close friend who went through the same thing (born at 25 weeks) who I've been leaning on. 

&#x200B;

Overall, a scary situation was handled very professionally and turned out mostly positive and I get 3 extra months with my LO. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR.** I went into preterm labor at 25+4.  I was holed up in the hospital for a few days to slow it down but ultimately had a vajayjay birth at 26+1. [Baby Jameson](https://imgur.com/a/bWOR6hp) is doing very well all things considered and I healed up just fine. He's currently in a wonderful NICU and making slow and steady progress. He'll hopefully be out by his due date (Oct 3) - best case is he gets out mid september, but there's always the chance he's in there past his due date.

BabyBumps,Some thoughts 4 months after the big day,"I always liked reading these while I was pregnant. So I thought I’d do one myself

I have no big definitely needed item list. That was such a BIG worry when I was pregnant, but I’m not sure why I was so stressed about it all now. Make sure you got somewhere for baby to safely sleep, stuff for them for eating, can travel safely, and you have enough clothes. The rest will come in time. Baby might hate stuff you’ve got so don’t go crazy. Amazon prime exists so you can have whatever you need pretty quick.

The fourth trimester is EXTREMELY REAL. Read up about it. Try not to get too upset when your baby just will not be put down for any naps, it’s hard, but it is normal. I spent a long time worrying I was making bad sleep associations etc and he must nap in his crib. A lot of stress on both sides when all my baby has known for 9 months is being warm and cuddled. 

Giving birth is just one day (or a few if you’re unlucky). I was so scared and worried about it, but legit your body just takes over and you are not in control. We ended up in theatre as baby’s heart rate was dipping very low, and whilst it was scary I was so out of it I can barely remember it now. Don’t spend the whole time reading about giving birth, prepare yourself for the afterwards. Also everybody poops, and it’s not that big a deal when you do (and I was the MOST worried about that) 

All those people who hounded you for when the baby will be due? Constant texts? Yeah those drop off. People will insist on coming to see you ASAP when the babies born. Unless you feel able to, don’t let them. It’s extremely stressful and doesn’t help. My partners family sat in my living room for three hours holding my baby, 3 days after I gave birth. I still look back on that and I am upset about it. As time goes on people start to drop off and not check in as much, and that can be lonely indeed. 

I’m aware in this current situation not many people can get out and see others, but try and use social media etc to connect with people going through the same as you. Motherhood can be very very lonely. Friendships change, priorities change. I’m thankful everyday I have two really solid mum friends

Communicate with your partner if you have one. This doesn’t apply to all partners, but it took a long time for mine to ‘click’ into what needed doing and we had so many fights about it. Just communicate and say what you feel, even if it’s hard. 

I thought the newborn stage would be awful and I’d absolutely hate it, but honestly even with the lack of sleep it’s not been too bad. Prep for sleep deprivation, and remember its survival at this point. Do what needs doing, the rest will come later 

Breastfeeding is hard. Read up as much as you can, buy stuff to make it easier. Remember it will get easier in time. Get all the help you can.

You’ll end up doing stuff you said you never would. It’s okay, every does that. Try not to worry too much about that bit.


The pure love I felt for my baby is like nothing I’ve ever felt before, and everything is worthwhile now. He’s the best thing I’ve ever done in my life, and I’m so proud and love him so much. I enjoy every single day with him. Treasure every hug, every nap on you, every special moment. Take pictures, so many pictures! One day they’ll just stop doing the cute little thing they did because they’ve grown out of it, and even at this early stage I love looking back at all my pictures and videos. 

Look after yourself too. It’s okay to quickly hop in the shower while the babies crying, just put them somewhere safe and take your five minutes. It’s okay to leave the baby with partner while you have that nap, or a long bath. Have that snack you want, do stuff that makes you happy. I feel like I appreciate small stuff so much more now, and happy mum=happy baby 

I hope this hasn’t been too depressing, but just remember to go in with a realistic idea of what parenthood is like. It ain’t all sunshine and rainbows, but when the sun does shine, it sure is beautiful ❤️",716,102,2020-05-27,born early

BabyBumps,I am furious at my family.,"This is a throwaway account since my friends know my main one. We are expecting our first, and we were excited so we decided to tell our families a little early. It was convenient, we were all going to be on a group call anyway so it would be a fun way to surprise them without being suspicious. We explicitly told them not to tell anyone yet, as we are only at 10 weeks, and things can still happen. 

Not 24 hours later my dad has told his coworkers, my mom has called and told her friends, and my stepmom told her group of friends. We didn't tell them that ""hey don't tell anyone because we could still potentially have a miscarriage"" but just told them it's a family secret don't tell. That should have been enough. 

Anyway, got a text from one of my best friends this morning on ""congratulations, i heard y'all are expecting."" Not really how I wanted him to find out, through a friend of one of my parents, especially when we are still so early along. 

This is just a venting post, I'm so mad at my family that I can't trust them with something so simple. If we have another in the future I guess they will find out when the baby is born, because I'm definitely not trusting them to keep the secret.",343,99,2020-08-23,born early
BabyBumps,"One week and a half postpartum, here's what's working for me.","Two way zip / zip from the bottom footed onesies. She's been in these onesies since home from the hospital. Great for diaper changes, and I haven't had to fuss with any snaps. The only thing I couldn't have anticipated is her baby feet are a bit long for some of the newborn onesies, so have a few sizes ready, or do a quick shop after they're born.    
      
Pacifier plus blanket across chest for diaper changes. One thing no one warned about was baby fussiness for diaper changes. This was and is the main occasion she gets upset, when we lay her down on the changing table and begin cleanup. We discovered if we give her the weight of more warmth from a baby blanket across her, she calms down while we're changing. And even though not full-on crying, she would still get fussy and upset. So we introduced a pacifier during changes, too. And that combo works nicely to help her stay calm while we get her in a clean diaper.     
      
Stroller bassinet in house. Baby doesn't like to be put down at all yet. (See: diaper changes.) So we haven't used the bassinet in our room, especially since the partner and I are on sleeping shifts. But what we have used is our Uppababy stroller bassinet. It's been helpful if it's just me and I need to put her down for a moment. I can be hands free and wheel her over to where I need to go. And then pick her up if she needs. There are other solutions for this, like baby wearing. But a week in I'm still getting the hang of things and this works.     
     
Fridababy nose sucker. She's had a few spitups that have come out of her nose, and this is a great help with cleanup and making sure she is breathing well.    
    
Ready-to-feed formula bottles. My hope was to breastfeed, but a week in my milk hasn't come in strong. I'm pumping and doing all the things. So formula has been my saving grace. And, as my partner and I have been acclimating to newborn life, especially during the first week, we've been pretty harried trying to change, sterilize bottles, do laundry. Having premade formula bottles at hand that we don't have to mix and prepare has been so nice to answering baby's feeding demands more immediately. The only thing is some premade bottles don't have nipples, so we'll still add to our own bottles.    
     
Altnernating between breast and bottle early. We introduced a bottle on day 3 because of low milk supply. And she's been switching between boob and bottle no problem. If you plan to bottle feed at some point, introduce the bottle as early as possible to acclimate baby.    
     
Protein bars. This one is for mama. I have no time for making meals, and we have no freezer space to keep anything prepared. Having something that has nutrition claims is some peace of mind. I don't think bars are a great substitute for real food, especially if they have a ton of sugar or artificial sweeteners. But to have something more substantial that I can grab for calories is nice.   
    
Shower and groom. If you have an extra hand, make sure to take fifteen minutes each day to keep your hygiene up, if possible. I know this is difficult in some scenarios, but if you can get a moment, it will help you continue to feel like a real person among all the baby madness.",305,79,2020-12-12,born early
BabyBumps,Why I'll never see another midwife,"My first child was born at 41 weeks. She was estimated to be 7 lbs and was born at 8lbs1oz. I had a natural unmedicated birth that ended in a 3rd degree tear and significant blood loss. It was horrific and traumatic for me. My recovery was significantly more difficult than any of my friends who had c sections. 

With this pregnancy, I have gestational diabetes. Baby has been consistently measuring large for gestational age. His size has been estimated 3x by ultrasound. His belly is measuring above the 99th percentile. I am terrified of delivering a large baby and have been begging for a c section.

My high risk doctor said I am not to go past 39 weeks because of the risk of my placenta failing. There are two midwives and two OBs at the regular practice I go to. One of the midwives told me that I absolutely could not have a c section unless the baby was measuring over 10 lbs. She also tried to convince me that I didn't have to listen to the high risk doctor and that I could go to 40 weeks. She didn't listen to any of my concerns.

On Monday at 36+6 I saw the second OB for the first time. At this point, baby is estimated at around 8 lbs. We went over the risks plus my fears and concerns. He recommended induction at 38+0 and felt it was the best option for me. He told me that I was free to wait until 39 weeks if I really wanted to and that he would recommend a c section at that point based on how my previous birth went, but he said that ultimately it was my decision. Now he is going to deliver my baby instead.

I saw the other midwife today, who I usually see, and she acted mad that the OB scheduled an induction for me at 38+0. She said she would have been ok with me going to 39 weeks. I told her that I was happy about the induction and explained why I thought it was a good idea. She still acted mad at him about it, said she would not have recommended that, and offered to reschedule my induction. I said no.

One of the midwives has completely ignored my concerns, the other has ignored my concerns and made potentially dangerous suggestions that go against what the high risk Dr said was necessary.

I will never again see another midwife. I'll be seeing this OB from here on out, including for my future annual visits. I have felt so ignored and like they didn't see me as an individual with individual medical history and needs.

I feel much safer and relieved now that I am having an early induction and am delivering with a dr who listens to me.",127,90,2020-07-17,gestational age
BabyBumps,"Baby Patrick, 4lb 5oz (IUGR, oligohydramnios) born at 36+2 - fast, unmedicated induction","First some background on the IUGR and oligohydramnios diagnosis, which I would have found helpful to read beforehand!  

I had a very easy pregnancy, physically (to the extent that I worried a lot at the beginning about the absence of symptoms like nausea and vomiting).  At the 20 week ultrasound, baby was all curled up with his hands and feet in his face, so the ultrasound tech couldn't see everything and she asked me to come back at 28 weeks - same thing - and then 31 weeks. At the time, we were excited, because my husband got to join for the third go around, and we joked that baby was on strike until papa could join us! At the third ultrasound, they mentioned that my amniotic fluid was on the low end of normal (7ish, and it should be 5-25), so we started weekly ultrasounds. Two weeks later, they did a growth measurement and found that he was pretty small for his gestational age, 20-somethingth percentile, but said it wasn't a problem as long as he kept pace.  

In future ultrasounds, my fluid fluctuated (but always low), but he did great on all the other metrics, moved regularly, passed NSTs, etc.  The 33-week growth scan showed similar weight percentile, but at 35 weeks he dropped below 10%. I had increased my fluids intake to 10c (80oz) a day, which was a lot for me, but it wasn't budging my amniotic fluid numbers. Between weight and fluids, this suggested my placenta wasn't doing its job.  

At 35 weeks, then, we were told to prepare for induction around 37 weeks. I made a list of priorities for the next two weeks, at work and at home. But at 36 weeks, the ultrasound showed my fluids were even lower - 3.5. The maternal fetal medicine doctor asked me to come back 2 days later, and to bring our hospital bags just in case. So I revised my list of priorities to those that could and should happen in the next two days....  

I definitely pushed myself too hard the next day. I'm a professor, and I rereviewed a paper, resubmitted a paper, submitted a huge grant proposal, and met for the first time with my brand new grad student.  I also picked up our car from the shop, dropped off returns, finished painting two door frames in the baby's future room, made 40 empanadas and another meal for the freezer, cooked and delivered dinner for a friend who had a baby a few weeks before, baked banana bread for a potential hospital stay, cleaned up some lingering messes in the house, and we packed our bags. We were really hoping to still have another week or so but had to err on the safe side!  

We got 4-5 hours of sleep Thursday night and then went in for the ultrasound at 9:15am (36+1). Baby passed the BPP just fine but fluids had dropped to 2.5. The MFM specialist checked with the birthplace and walked me over while my husband went to get the bags from the car.  

We got checked in, ordered lunch and ate, then I got tested for covid (and cried; it was terrible), got the beta methasone shot for baby's lungs (which they said would hurt but didn't at all), got an IV port placed (which took two tries, and ended up awkwardly in my left wrist) and my first cervical check - closed and hard. My OB came by to discuss the induction (with cytotec) and expectations. He said it could easily be 48 hours, especially because I was starting from absolute zero.  

They inserted the first tiny cytotec pill around 1 or 2pm.  I laid in bed and sent some emails canceling stuff for next week, reading on my kindle, snacking. I napped for about an hour and a half. The second dose came around 5 - after a check that found me still closed - and I started to feel some occasional tightening of my uterus. I hadn't had any Braxton hicks or anything, so it was my first time feeling contractions at all. They were so mild I couldn't tell when they ended, just when they started. At 8pm I got a 3rd dose of cytotec and was still basically closed.  

Then around 9:45, my water broke. I moved and felt some fluid - at first I thought it was just gel and discharge and stuff, because it wasn't a ton (but then again the reason we were there was because I didn't have much fluid to leak out!). They tested to confirm. Pretty quickly, the contractions got a bit more painful and, importantly, were only 2 minutes apart (30 to 40 seconds long). I texted the doula and she was pretty surprised that it had escalated so quickly.  

At 11:30pm the resident checked me again and I was 3cm, 50% effaced.  I think I got another dose of cytotec here.  The doula showed up shortly afterward and helped me try some different positions. I liked the birthing ball and 'throne' the best. My husband took a nap for about an hour and a half, which was a brilliant decision at that point. I mostly sat in throne position and breathed through the contractions, eyes closed, trying to rest in between.  

At some point i started shaking and threw up in the bathroom and felt a lot better, but then the contractions got worse. I had to moan through the peaks. Eventually I asked my husband to count the moans for me - at first 3 each time, then 4, then 5. I was also getting double peaks with almost every contraction, going almost all the way away before coming back for a second, slightly more intense round. Things also got worse because they were having a hard time getting good data on the monitors - the baby's heart rate data was sporadic and they never really had a good read on my contractions. They weren't confident that his heart rate was good, and if it was bad, how bad. They spent a lot of time moving the monitors and a few times made me change positions. That was frustrating because sometimes it was during a contraction, which made them so much worse, and also because I just didn't have the freedom of movement I wanted. The doula suggested a shower, but I couldn't, and the birth ball was also basically not compatible.  Later, when they really started to struggle with the monitors, they asked to put them in intravaginally. I sort of felt like it didn't improve the data that much though. They also did an amnioinfusion to get him a bit more cushioning in there.  

At one point, I decided I was basically at my limit - I could handle what I was feeling, but not anything more. I figured we were going to start pitocin soon so I asked for more fluids so I could an epidural. But they checked me and I was at 7cm, so they said I was so close! And I decided I could handle the status quo.  

I did some contractions on hands and knees and felt a strong urge to pee. On the toilet, I also had some urge to poop, and everyone was very curious about it, saying it might be the urge to push, but it was actually a poo!  The urge to pee stayed, though, and was apparently my cue to push.   

They checked me again at some point and I was 9cm, so they said I could push. I did a few on my knees draped over the top of the bed, then moved to my back. I saw my OB and some nurses setting up all the equipment to catch the baby, and that encouraged me.  Pushing felt like a poop that just wouldn't move, and it felt giant. (I had seen the plastic board that they used to gauge dilation and the 10cm circle freaked me the fuck out.)  Pushing definitely made him move down. I asked for a mirror and once saw a bit of a red (bloody) head show itself for a second before disappearing back in.  

Pushing was hard. Almost as bad was when the urge stopped and I had a big old head halfway down my vagina. Here someone said something very helpful - there will be times when your body wants to stop and you don't want to, but the tissues need time to stretch. That made a lot of sense to me as a biomechanicist (look up viscoelasticity), and completely changed my feelings about the breaks.  

They got me in stirrups and I yelled at people to hold my knees, which were shaking. All the pushes felt more or less the same. I was getting pretty foul mouthed, yelling fuck and I hate this and I can't do it. My husband kept telling me that this was very ""by the book"". I started to get hoarse, and the doula told me to keep the noise in and push that energy downwards. I think I did that for one or two rounds and the baby popped out, all at once! It was 5:17am, 20 hours after the ultrasound appointment began. 

I had a second-degree tear, which my OB said was - counterintuitively - because he was so small and came out all at once, instead of more slowly.

Baby was 4lb 5oz and did pretty well right off the bat.  Any concerns about his lungs were immediately assuaged because he cried passionately for about 10 minutes. I jokingly told him, in through your nose, out through your mouth.  The put him on my stomach and, the doula was right, I didn't mind the vernix or the blood all over him (or for that matter, me or the bed).  My husband cut the cord in one snip and then we brought him further up towards me.  

I really just couldn't believe it. That I had done that, that my body had taken to the induction so well, that he was here and okay, that it had gone so fast, that I did it without any drugs except cytotec.  

We stayed in the hospital for two and a half days, and were released after spending an hour in an interior conference room due to tornado warnings because 2020.  

A few comments that might be helpful to others: 

1. After my experience, it's very clear to me that it's not helpful to attach virtue to unmedicated births.  Mine was something I could handle, but if it had not been, I was interested in medication.  The unmedicated part was not due to something intrinsically strong or courageous in me, but I think more so in the nature of my birth.
2. I found it helpful to think about why I did or didn't want an epidural.  I wanted to maintain freedom of positions and didn't want to slow things down; when it looked like I wasn't going to have the former and the latter didn't seem to be an issue, it made sense for me to reconsider.  (And then when I was so close, it made sense to reconsider again.)
3. When I found out I was going to be induced, I slightly regretted having paid $800 to hire a doula.  In the end, I have no such regrets!   Inductions are not a one-size-fits-all story and she was still helpful in coaching, encouraging, preparing, suggesting positions, keeping me hydrated, etc.",243,23,2020-08-29,gestational age

BabyBumps,The 20 anatomy week scan: What sonographers are looking at,"Hi everyone! As a Sonographer, I thought you guys might be interested in learning about what we have to know/look at for the 20-week anatomy scans. This is a medical procedure, and we are looking at many potential problems that can occur during a baby's growth. It can be a pretty stressful exam for a sonographer. This is sometimes the only exam where baby is really checked over, and they want to be careful to not miss anything and stay on schedule for their other patients, while also trying to be professional and kind to the mamas. It can be a hard balance, but we try and do our best.

This might be a little long, but I'll try and break it up.

If you have any other questions about procedure and what's going on behind the scenes, you could ask in r/ultrasound. While we don't do diagnoses there, or interpret images, we are happy to help people understand what is going on during the ultrasound, why we do/don't do certain things and what the machine is capable of!

I'm hoping that this information is informative and interesting, and doesn't cause anyone additional stress. I hope that you walk away from reading this realizing the depth of our checks on the baby at the 20 week scan and take that positively, not worrying about every possible thing that could possibly go wrong.

&#x200B;

Step 1: Count the babies, count the placentas, find fetal heart activity. We first need to know what we are working with, so we start with a broad overall view. After figuring out all the we have to deal with, we then make sure that the baby or babies have heart movement, because if we can't find that, the exam and day is going to change for the worse. Everyone comes in excited for a gender reveal and assuming their baby is healthy, but unfortunately that is not always the case. :(

Step 2: It's not just about the baby. After checking out the baby and placenta, we look at the woman's cervix and uterus, to make sure there are no problems there - related to or unrelated to the pregnancy.

Step 3: Back to the baby. We measure the amount of amniotic fluid, making sure there is not too much or two little. They can mean different things to a pregnancy, and can let us know if there might be any problems or potential problems to be monitored for (diabetes, preeclampsia, or just simple dehydration).

Step 4: Assuming from now on there is baby with a healthy heartbeat found, our next steps are to make sure that the organs are on the right sides of the body and figure out how the baby is laying within the mother. We check that the heart and stomach are on the left sides of the body, and use that information to know what way the baby is facing as they inevitably flip around during the exam.

Step 5: The actual fetal anatomy survey. I'm not going to put this in order, because we can't always do it in a specific order. We try to do it in ""chapters"", and keep related images together. Order depends on the position of the baby. There are so many things to check, and sometimes the baby is not in a good position to see some things accurately. So, we take them in the order that the baby allows, and hope that they don't turn over too fast, or that they do turn over after we finish one side, haha.

BRAIN: Since the baby's skull isn't bone yet, but cartilage, we can see through it. Our goal is to find certain brain structures. Since the baby's skull forms/grows from the outside towards the center, if we can find certain structures near the center/midline of the brain, it means that everything until that point has grown correctly. If you're building something and mess up step 1, the rest of the steps are going to get messed up too. By proving that different central brain structures are the right size, shape, and in the right place, we prove that the baby's brain is correctly formed. There are 6 brain structures that we have to locate and image, and a few of those we have to measure. At this time, we also measure the head circumference and diameter, to make sure that the baby is at the right size for its age. Lastly, we look at the brain's blood supply, and make sure that it is getting all it needs.

This is also where we can, if we are in the right spot, take a measurement of a nuchal fold. If the nuchal fold measurement is too large, it means that there is an increased risk of a genetic trisomy disorder. Which means any of the disorders related to having 3 of a chromosome instead of two. (Trisomy 13, Trisomy 18, or Trisomy 21/Down's Syndrome)

FACE: We look for a profile shot (this is often one of the ones you take home), to look at the nasal bone, lips, and chin. We also look at the lips and nose from a second, straight on angle, that lets us see the contours better. We want to find a nasal bone, because if it is absent, it is associated with some of those Trisomy conditions and means that there is a higher risk that the baby has one of them. We look at the lips to make sure that there is not a cleft lip. If we know about a cleft lip ahead of time, it can be easier on the parents and hospital staff to fix it as soon as possible after birth. We can also see the lenses in the eyes, which means the baby does not have cataracts.

\[I'm going to say a little something about what we call ""soft markers"" here. Some of these things such as the nasal bone being absent, or the nuchal fold being a little large, are called SOFT MARKERS. There are quite a few of them, and they happen in completely normal babies. We call them soft markers because if there is just one of them, we are not at all worried about the baby having a problem. When they show up in multiples however, we recommend further testing because there is an increased risk of some disorders. But having just one of them is a normal variation.\]

SPINE: The baby needs to be back facing up for this one, and we look at the whole spine from the neck to the tailbone. We have to make sure that each vertebra has 3 points, and that the skin is covering the entire back over the spine. We're looking for spina bifida here, a failure of the spinal cord to be enclosed.

ABDOMEN: We look at the lungs, heart, kidney, stomach, and bladder. When we can see the stomach and where the umbilical cord comes in, we know that we are at the right spot to measure the abdomen. This measurement helps us guess at the baby's weight.

LUNGS: Are they there? Are there any masses or fluid pushing on the lungs?

HEART: The position and axis that it is on. It should be about mid-chest, but pointing to the left. We need to check that all 4 chambers are there, and that there are barriers between them and valves opening and closing as the blood moves. We look at the different ways that everything connects to the heart, and make sure everything is in the right place and connected correctly - no holes anywhere.

KIDNEYS: We make sure they are the correct size and in the correct places. We check to make sure that urine is draining properly, sometimes it can get a little ""backed up"" and the kidneys will be dilated.

STOMACH: We just need to see that it is on the left side.

BLADDER: While the baby is inside you, its urinary system is working and practicing. The baby swallows amniotic fluid, which we can see in the stomach. Then, if everything is connected correctly and working, we can see the bladder fill up, then empty. All this happens at least 1 time per hour, so we need to be able to see it to confirm that everything is working correctly. So during the 1 hour scan time, we need to be able to see the bladder full at one point, and the bladder empty. They don't have to be in that order, though. Often we will check at the very beginning if the bladder is full or empty. If it started out full, and when we look later it is empty, we know that it is working. If it was empty, and now it is full, we can assume that it is working properly as well.

LIMBS: You would think this would be easy, but when the baby is flailing around in there, sometimes a sonographer realizes that they just measured the same arm twice and have to redo it. As part of our measurements for size, we measure the length of the femur (thigh bone), which also helps for weight calculations. Other than that, we are just taking pictures looking for presence/absence of all the limbs and bones. start at a shoulder, take the upper arm image, follow it down, forearm, and then get a hand with all the fingers. Repeat other side, then repeat with legs.

And that's the full medical anatomy scan of the baby.

Step 6: Placenta and umbilical cord - make sure that it has all of the arteries and vein it needs (2 arteries, 1 vein), and make sure the placenta looks healthy and isn't too close to the cervix. When I was learning this, I wasn't surprised to hear that we had to check and make sure the umbilical cord wasn't wrapped around the babies neck, with so much moving around. I was surprised, though, to hear that we only get worried if it is wrapped around the neck 2 or more times. apparently, once is normal and perfectly fine, they'll probably flip it off with all the moving about in no time.

Step 7: The part everyone was waiting for. Check out those fun bits, and find out if you're going to have a boy or a girl. Hopefully they're not crossing their legs and shy. :)

&#x200B;

After the anatomy scan, some places offer a trans vaginal ""cervical length screening"" to see if you are at-risk for preterm delivery. If you've had a preterm delivery before, they usually recommend you get it. If you don't have any risk factors, they don't often press if you're not interested. For the screening, they have you take your pants/underwear off, feet in the stirrups, and insert the transvaginal probe. Then they take measurements of your cervix length, and then a few videos of what the cervix looks like when there is pressure being put on your abdomen, like there would be when you have contractions. For this, we press firmly on your lower abdomen while taking a clip of the cervix. If it opens up at all, that could be a cause for concern to be discussed with your doctor.

A transvaginal exam can also be useful if your placenta is particularly low-lying. Then the tech can see exactly how close it is to the cervix, or if it is covering the cervix at all. Sometimes it can be difficult to see, especially if baby's head is low.

&#x200B;

I hope that didn't scare anyone, and I hope it was interesting to you guys.

Have a happy, healthy pregnancy!!

BabyBumps,"12 weeks, TERRIFIED of vaginal birth/tearing, considering c-section","Hi all!

So I'm currently 12 weeks pregnant with my first child, and I am starting to consider my birthing options.  Tbh the thought of going through vaginal birth terrifies me, I cannot picture myself doing it.  The thought of tearing makes me sick to my stomach. My mom had 3 C-sections and I guess I always just thought if I ever had a baby I would have one too.  

Well, after doing some research, apparently elective C-sections aren't as common as I thought they were, and there's a good chance that my insurance won't cover it.  I haven't spoken to my ob about this yet, because of covid I have only had one appointment so far and won't be seeing her again until July.  I am 35, and so far there haven't been any complications with my pregnancy although because of my age I am considered ""high-risk"".  

I guess what I'm looking for is women who elected to have a c-section to share your experience with me - how did you broach the conversation with your ob?  What were your reasons for choosing surgery?  Would you make the same decision again?  Did your insurance cover it and if not, how much was your out of pocket costs?

If you're one of those mombies that believes that you're not a real woman/mom if you don't give birth naturally, kindly fuck off and stay off this thread.

BabyBumps,"Why is it expected/acceptable that women will suffer through pregnancy without treatment for ailments, compromising their own health and well-being, just for the sake of the fetus?","I’m about 8 weeks pregnant and already at my wits end. I’ve taken issue with women’s healthcare in the US for a long time, but the treatment of women during pregnancy is by far the worst. 

This is a planned pregnancy, and I understood in advance that pregnancy is just one of the millions of sacrifices a mother will make for her child. However, I have a sneaking suspicion that if men were the ones who carried a pregnancy, the first-line treatment for debilitating pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting would not be an OTC sedative + vitamin B in the year 2020. That sounds more like a treatment for hysteria in 1820. 

I take several medications normally for asthma, allergies, and acid reflux. MD has advised that she will generously “allow” me to continue taking my asthma medication, but has advised me to stop the others — “heartburn and allergies may make you uncomfortable for a few months, but it’s a small price to pay to have a healthy baby.” As for the nausea? “Ginger and crackers are best.” I’ve lost 7 lbs in 2 weeks, and I was only 110 lbs at baseline. I hardly think that malnutrition and dehydration can be better for the developing fetus than a fucking Prilosec in the morning to keep acid reflux at bay. 

Right now, the “baby” is little more than a blueberry-sized parasite that is feeding off me, but I should be treated as the patient. If I choose to consider the implications of my own treatment on that of a tentative fetus, then that’s my choice to make, just like a patient may cross-reference a recommended treatment against their religious or social preferences. 

My fury is perhaps intensified by the fact that I have a PhD in pharmacology and am well aware of what evidence exists — or doesn’t exist — regarding adverse effects of each medication on a developing fetus.  I wouldn’t take Accutane or tetracycline while pregnant, but the theoretical risk a Claritin tablet poses to the developing fetus is a chance I’m willing to take. When I confronted the MD about the supposed evidence (I was told metoclopramide is a teratogen, which it is not) her only defense was that maybe it doesn’t say in the literature that it’s a teratogen but she has “seen it many times over the years.” Oh really? 😂 So this MD established a causal relationship between metoclopramide and birth defects, purely based on her own anecdotal case studies and observations? I wonder if she got IRB approval for this study.

BabyBumps,You’re strong than you think,"It’s taken me a while to feel okay with sharing my circumstances with others but I think it’s important and I’m hoping I can help someone else if they are silently going through something similar.

*********

At 37 weeks pregnant, I found out my husband was having an emotional affair with a coworker. I stopped eating, I stopped sleeping (and you know it’s already difficult to sleep while pregnant). I felt my heart breaking constantly. We tried for years for our miracle baby, I just couldn’t understand it. I worried about how it was affecting my unborn daughter. I felt like a failure as a mother already and she hadn’t even been born yet.

She was born via c-section full term, a perfect weight, in perfect health. An angel.

I left when she was 1 week old — still in pain from my section — with nothing but a suitcase full of mine and her clothes and a few other essentials and moved in with family. While it’s been nice to have them keep a roof over my head and feeding me right now, I do everything else on my own. Exclusively breastfeeding, all the nappy changes, all the midnight waking, all the baths, all the spit up covered laundry, all of it. I’d be lying if I said it isn’t hard sometimes or that I don’t still sometimes cry myself to sleep on a night because I never imagined I’d have to do this all on my own.

But you know what I’ve found? That I can function on very little sleep and do it with (for the most part) a smile on my face. My capacity for love and care hasn’t diminished despite being so broken — it’s actually grown by leaps and bounds. My patience isn’t as thin as I once thought it was. I’m not as selfish as I had always assumed myself to be. I’m not the weak person  I felt I was when I found out about the affair. I’m strong and capable and determined and resilient and worth so much more. Being alone isn’t as scary as I thought it would be.

More importantly, I found out that I’m a fantastic mother. I absolutely kill it every day and sometimes I feel like thanking my ex for doing what he did as this has been so eye opening for me. I go to bed every night — exhausted, covered in spit up, greasy from not showering, with a sore back and sore nipples — and feel accomplished because my girl is thriving and happy and loved and that’s on ME.

So, to any woman out there who is pregnant or just having given birth and are struggling with a failing relationship (for whatever reason) please know, you are not a failure. Leaving is not as earth shattering as it feels. You CAN do this. Reach out for help. I started antidepressants the day after I found out at 37 weeks pregnant and I’m grateful I did as I’ve avoided any PPD/A to speak of. I’m in therapy every week
Via Zoom. I’m going out on walks every day with baby in a carrier because the fresh air really helps. I have friends who know about my situation and they have been invaluable for verbal support.

Your baby needs you and YOU are enough. If you’re not being supported, if you’re in an abusive relationship, if you’re being disrespected or cheated on, you don’t have to stick around. You and your baby deserve so much more.

*And a bonus nugget of information — my ex has come crawling back. He’s seen what a wonderful woman and mother I am, how I’m thriving without him, and he is now grovelling to be back with me.*

See comment for more info.","How does this happen you ask?  Well, I was diagnosed with PCOS last year and had doctors telling me if it was normal in my condition to not have a period due to the situation.  I've never had a child before and I work a laborious job that puts my body in low level pain alot.  3 weeks ago, I got to this point where I couldn't understand why I was having to pee all the time and I was taking a new medication that I thought could maybe causing some side effects.

I still had this inkly of thought to think about pregnancy and finally just randomly said to my husband ""Hey, would you mind if I took a rapid pregnancy test?  I don't want to just get one and have you freak out on me if you find me doing it and it's just to dispell some concerns.  I honestly don't think I'm pregnant"".

He nicely bullied me then to get the test and late that night I get a surprise positive test reading.  Husband gently freaks and has a mini internal crisis (new daddy thoughts).  I then got into my primary to take a blood test following day and on Columbus day, got positive results with estimate of 6 to 7 weeks.

I then struggled and filled out fifty billion forms to get into an obygyne clinic that wasn't able to see me until 2 weeks following.  When I get in, the pandemic forced me to go alone and I, again, was expecting something unexpected I just got blown out of the water.

The woman goes to plunk the wand inside me, then takes it out and really quickly changes to the sonogram.  This is when I get told ""So you think you are around 10 weeks hun? .....Well you're actually more than that"".

""Okay.....how much more?""

""Ohh...I'd say around 28 or 29 weeks...""

....I start hyperventilating and Ohmygodding and she had to spend 5 to 10 minutes talking me into a calmer state.  Baby seems to have strong heart beat and she told me baby looks good.  The next room I get pulled into I get told I'm actually 31 weeks and 4 days estimate.

Long story short, my husband and I thought we'd have many many more months to prepare and now we have less than 8 weeks to get everything ready for the little firecracker coming in hot into our lives.  We are happy, we are just scared.  

So with that, do any of you have nice suggestions on baby items I may need that I wouldn't think of?

BabyBumps,In the hospital 18.5 weeks pregnant recovering from brain surgery.,"These past few days have been the absolute scariest days of my life and I just need to talk and share with other moms.
I am 18.5 weeks pregnant and since week 12 ish I’ve had terrible headaches. I called my OB twice who has helped a ton with meds and just trying to get me through that second trimester headache wave. Thursday afternoon it was so bad no meds were helping and I could barely see. My OB sent me to labor and delivery triage and after giving meds with no improvement decided to do an MRI just Incase.
Within an hour I was told I had three brain aneurysms one 14mm long that was already leaking and was rushed my ambulance to our university hospital neurological ICU and in brain surgery within hours.
I don’t remember much I just remember being so scared for my baby boy and begging for them to make him safe.
After a 5 hour surgery everything is fixed went perfectly and I’ve been able to see him on an US and listen to his heart tones five times a day since. 
I am so thankful I caught it in time. He was kicking so much before I went under anesthesia it’s something I’ll never forget. I felt like he was just telling me “we got this mom” I just can’t believe we’ve been through so much together already. He’s so damn tough😭
Our bodies are seriously miraculous. Thanks for letting me share, alone in the hospital and just wanted to talk💙

BabyBumps,Just Learned I'm Pregnant – At 30 - 36 Weeks!,"Hello! I learned last week that I (31 F) am not only pregnant, but 3rd trimester pregnant! I've seen 3 doctors and been given 3 different possible due dates. 

Some background info: I have had PCOS since puberty, so my periods have always been irregular. I have (had) been on birth control for the last 4 years or so. I was diagnosed with lupus in November 2019. All of these factors combined led me to misjudge, ignore, or misappropriate symptoms of pregnancy! In fact, what led me to see a doctor was that I felt a ""mass"" in my abdomen and I was concerned that it might be a large ovarian cyst, or possibly even a tumor. She sent me for a CT scan, but thankfully they did a weak x-ray first and we saw an unmistakable upside-down little skeleton inside of me!

My boyfriend and I are finally getting over the initial shock, but now that I know I have a lot of sadness. I've been pregnant this entire year and I did not know! Thankfully I neither drink nor smoke, but I have so much guilt about ""neglecting"" my baby, not to mention having x-rayed her!! (The radiologist assured me the amount was fine, especially because of how far along I am.)

The earliest estimation of my due date is August 21st (!!!), based off of ultrasound measurements, and the latest is in the beginning of October,  based off the last period I remember. I've read up on it, and late term ultrasound estimations can be off by up to 30 days if there are no others to compare them to! Being so far along, it seems impossible to narrow down this TWO MONTH window! 

We are preparing for the August date, just in case, (baby shower in two weeks, scrambling to turn BF's office into a nursery), but I'm praying to the universe that she stays in until at least late September.

It is extremely stressful and sad not to know when my baby is coming, how far along I am, and to have missed at least 6 months of joyful expectation! To be dealing with Covid-19 restrictions on top of all this...

BabyBumps,Some very “WTF” things they don’t tell you about pregnancy.,"25 weeks, first-time mom. Here is a list of things that NO ONE bothered to tell me about being pregnant:

1. You haven’t actually stopped peeing until you try it once, stand up, sit down and then pee a second time. Leaving the house without doing this will bring you a world of regret (especially since public restrooms aren’t a thing right now.)

2. Your nipples will leak without telling you and then they will dry, and you’ll look down the next morning and immediately think you have cancer or a rare nipple disease oh my god. 

3. Speaking of nipples, they are permanently erect now and they feel like fire at all times. You can cut glass with them. You are now Andy Bernard in that episode of The Office with the rabies fun-run. 

4. Your baby can, and WILL, kick you square in the butthole from inside the womb. They do not apologize. Do not expect flowers. 

5. First kicks don’t always feel like butterflies or a fun little goldfish. They can also feel like your bladder is trying to off itself one explosion at a time. It will launch you off the couch in a panic and there is nothing you can do about it. 

6. You won’t know where your stomach is anymore now that your organs are all squished around. Your doctor doesn’t know. Your midwife doesn’t know. Nobody fucking knows but you’ll still get reminded that it’s there by the HOT LAVA heartburn that happens if you even THINK about a banana before going to sleep. 

7. Doing the dishes takes three sessions because standing up is impossible for more than two minutes. You will feel like you need an oxygen tank. Or a priest. 

8. Constipation is more difficult than normal because, as you may remember from #6, you don’t know or understand where your organs are anymore. Your body is just trying to poop but your liver and kidneys suddenly have to voice their shitty opinions, as well as whatever the hell is in your ribcage at the moment, and you more than likely will google “AM I DYING?” at four AM. This will happen more than once. 

Have I missed anything? I’m only 25 weeks so I guess I get another full trimester to find out. Pregnancy is such a BEAUTIFUL MIRACLE.

*********

At 37 weeks pregnant, I found out my husband was having an emotional affair with a coworker. I stopped eating, I stopped sleeping (and you know it’s already difficult to sleep while pregnant). I felt my heart breaking constantly. We tried for years for our miracle baby, I just couldn’t understand it. I worried about how it was affecting my unborn daughter. I felt like a failure as a mother already and she hadn’t even been born yet.

She was born via c-section full term, a perfect weight, in perfect health. An angel.

I left when she was 1 week old — still in pain from my section — with nothing but a suitcase full of mine and her clothes and a few other essentials and moved in with family. While it’s been nice to have them keep a roof over my head and feeding me right now, I do everything else on my own. Exclusively breastfeeding, all the nappy changes, all the midnight waking, all the baths, all the spit up covered laundry, all of it. I’d be lying if I said it isn’t hard sometimes or that I don’t still sometimes cry myself to sleep on a night because I never imagined I’d have to do this all on my own.

But you know what I’ve found? That I can function on very little sleep and do it with (for the most part) a smile on my face. My capacity for love and care hasn’t diminished despite being so broken — it’s actually grown by leaps and bounds. My patience isn’t as thin as I once thought it was. I’m not as selfish as I had always assumed myself to be. I’m not the weak person  I felt I was when I found out about the affair. I’m strong and capable and determined and resilient and worth so much more. Being alone isn’t as scary as I thought it would be.

More importantly, I found out that I’m a fantastic mother. I absolutely kill it every day and sometimes I feel like thanking my ex for doing what he did as this has been so eye opening for me. I go to bed every night — exhausted, covered in spit up, greasy from not showering, with a sore back and sore nipples — and feel accomplished because my girl is thriving and happy and loved and that’s on ME.

So, to any woman out there who is pregnant or just having given birth and are struggling with a failing relationship (for whatever reason) please know, you are not a failure. Leaving is not as earth shattering as it feels. You CAN do this. Reach out for help. I started antidepressants the day after I found out at 37 weeks pregnant and I’m grateful I did as I’ve avoided any PPD/A to speak of. I’m in therapy every week
Via Zoom. I’m going out on walks every day with baby in a carrier because the fresh air really helps. I have friends who know about my situation and they have been invaluable for verbal support.

Your baby needs you and YOU are enough. If you’re not being supported, if you’re in an abusive relationship, if you’re being disrespected or cheated on, you don’t have to stick around. You and your baby deserve so much more.

*And a bonus nugget of information — my ex has come crawling back. He’s seen what a wonderful woman and mother I am, how I’m thriving without him, and he is now grovelling to be back with me.*

BabyBumps,"Any helpful hints to stay full term, make it to the due date?","This pregnancy I found out I will have a baby with a congenital heart defect and she will have surgery just a few days after her scheduled csection which is set for two days before her EDD. 
My first pregnancy went to exact due date. And even with that it was full moon, I had the membrane sweep the prior week, water broke first, etc. then labor was delayed because I got scared when they kept telling me things I didn’t understand (like dry birth, slow labor, weak labor, you can’t get there without pitocin+epidural) and finally I ended up using all the fun stuff plus getting a csection. So while I’m a STM I have no experience with pushing a baby out. My first was on his way out by the time his heart rate went down so much that they pushed him back up to do a csection. 
So, with this pregnancy being high risk because of her defect, I really want to do everything I can to make it my csection date. I know we cannot plan for everything (remember I’m having a baby with a heart defect, didn’t plan for that) so I’m not expecting this all to be rules for it work or guides that are full proof. 
If we can have a discussion of your opinions, experiences, things you think make you deliver early and could be a possible cautionary tale, etc. I’d like to hear them all.

BabyBumps,"Birth Story - FTM, Early PPROM, made it to full term @ 38w1d, quick induction, no epidural, hyperextended knee","My little girl was born on Nov 9 at 4:14am, 19.5in, 6lb8oz. The whole journey has been a crazy one, and while I was going through it I couldn't find a lot of info or stories similar to mine, so I wanted to share in case anyone else goes through something similar. 

TLDR & baby pics at the bottom

BACKGROUND -

It really starts at 13w1d. I had a drs appt already scheduled for that day for the nuchal scan. Early in the morning, I was just standing in the bathroom and had a gush of fluid. It wasn't a huge amount but I thought it was weird. About a hour later, I had a much bigger gush. And then a little while after that a smaller one again. 

I went to my appointment, and they said I had little to no amnitoic fluid. The dr felt based on my story that I had leaked fluid, did a quick exam in the office and didn't see anything currently leaking. She referred me to a MFM doctor.

At 15w I went to my first MFM appt. At that appt I still had very little fluid, but she said I did have a very small pocket. I never had any leaking after that one day at 13w1d. She said it looked like I had PPROM with no known cause (I did not have an infection, incompetent cervix, or any other thing that is known to case it). I decided to wait and see what would happen since I was still so early on.

I went to my next MFM appt around 17w. At this appointment my fluid was still low but had accumulated quite a bit since the last appointment. She said it looked promising and that I may have resealed whatever leak I had.

At 20w I had my anatomy scan. By this time I had a normal amount of fluid again. It was low-normal, but normal. Everything with her bones, organs, etc looked great. 

Somewhere around 22w-24w was my last appointment with the MFM. I still had normal fluid levels and she said everything looked great, she felt I didn't need to see her anymore unless something else came up.

The rest of the pregnancy itself was pretty uneventful. Everything continued to look good, but I did have high blood pressure prior to pregnancy that was getting a little higher as the pregnancy went on. So because of this my doctor recommended getting induced around 38w to reduce my risk of pre-eclampsia.

BIRTH STORY - 

My induction was scheduled for exactly 38w on a Sunday. I went in around 2pm, I was 3cm dilated and 50% effaced, -2 station. They inserted cervidil around 4pm - the actual cervix check really didn't hurt at all but the cervidil insertion was really painful for me. But luckily once it was in, the pain quickly went away. The plan was to have this for 12 hrs, and start pitocin around 4-4:30am. 

I just sat around and watched tv for the evening, really had no symptoms for hours. Around 10-10:30pm my back started bothering me. I thought maybe it was just the bed or the position I was in, but no matter what I did it was hurting. It wasn't anything terrible though for several hours. 

My husband came in around 1am and at that point I was feeling more crampy and more back pain. It was worse pain & cramping than the worst I get during my period, but not much worse and manageable.

Soon after that the pain started getting worse and I kept telling the nurses how bad everything hurt. They did a cervical check and I really hadn't progressed a ton yet, around 4cm, 75% effaced. The pain just kept getting worse and worse - they could see on the monitor I was having contractions but didn't really believe I could be quickly progressing since that's not what cervidil generally does.

Well it started going downhill fast and I was yelling in pain. Around 3am I was already 7-8cm dilated & almost 100% effaced. I had wanted an epidural so they called the anesthesiologist. They gave me stadol in the meantime but I had already progressed too far at that point, it did absolutely nothing for me. By the time the anesthesiologist got there around 3:30am, everyone decided including myself that this baby was coming fast and I had no time to get one. 

At this point I was feeling intense pressure to push , but they kept telling me to try and not  push until the doctor was there - my dr was at home so they had to call her in and she rushed there, she was out of breath by the time she got up to the room around 4am. I was fully dilated, so once she was there and ready, they told me to push.

I was in so much pain that it was really hard to follow what they were telling me, but I finally got the hang of it and after only 7 minutes of active pushing, our baby girl was born at 4:14am. She had some bruising on her forehead and legs from coming out so fast. I had a 2nd degree tear that was stitched up, as well as a 1st degree that didn't need stitches. The placenta came out quickly and easily, and any uterus massages they did after that really didn't bother me, I just felt so much relief from not having contraction pains anymore.

They quickly noticed that our babys left leg was bent the wrong way, but everything else was perfect, she had 9/9 apgar score. After getting xrays done at the hospital and going to an orthopedic doctor yesterday, its been determined she has a hyperextended knee. He doesn't feel surgery will be needed, right now we are doing leg exercises on her daily to help stretch out the tendon, and later on they will brace it. All the doctors that have seen her feel its just how her leg/knee grew in the womb, she does not have any physical characteristics that would indicate that it was part of a syndrome. It could be because of the issues I had with my amniotic fluid, or it could be unrelated, there is really no way to tell. 

We were discharged Tuesday afternoon and everything has been going good. She is breastfeeding well, sleeps a lot, and is overall adorable :)

TLDR - PPROM @ 13w1d, re-accumulated fluid to normal level by 20w, induction @ 38w due to high blood pressure, cervidil alone put me into full blown labor, no time for an epidural, she was born after 7min of active pushing, was born with a hyperextended knee that we should be able to correct using physical therapy & bracing

BabyBumps,"LONG: Unplanned baby, but loved and wanted. Now instead of the gender disappointment I was planning to deal with we are planning to say goodbye. TW: Termination FMR NHS UK","Two weeks ago I was a little excited to finally have my 20 week scan.  SO could finally see baby and I felt like it was going to be time to tell our eldest and other people we had been keeping it from.  I was a little worried because I had a feeling this would be boy number 3 and I had small hopes to finally re-balance our household.  This was a surprise baby; we were planned to be done given two c-sections, age (37 now) and my last pregnancy was hard on me.  But when it happened we decided to push on and welcome another child.  Things were relatively good.  I didn't feel pregnant half the time.  12 week scan was fine, no immediate red flags.  I did have a episode of biliary colic the next day and got checked out to be diagnosed with gallstones.  After conferring with a surgeon it became clear I would just have to maintain a low fat diet and they would operate after baby was born.  Other than that things seemed hunky dory, just exhausting being pregnant with two kids, one just turned 1.  

The sonographer seemed preoccupied while doing the scan.  She asked if we wanted to know the sex and I turned to my SO and checked he didn't want to have a surprise for the last go around.  He confirmed he wanted to know and the sonographer said as almost a throwaway comment ""yeah, looks like a boy"" while looking intently at another part of his anatomy.  That was my first red flag.  After a little bit more looking at the heart, flashing up different colour views of blood flow, she told us it was a new machine and she was still getting used to the positioning of the buttons.  Not sure how true this was or whether she wanted to say something to reassure us because she was taking a long time trying to get a good view of the heart.  After a while she said she had some bad news.  She explained that she had seen a couple of concerning patterns in the examination of the baby.  She showed us his heart and explained that the valves should make a seagull shape rather than look flat.  She then showed us his stomach and intestines and said there was a ""double bubble"" which means there is likely a problem with the development of intestines and then finally she said the one she couldn't be 100% of was a possibility of a cleft lip.  Some views looked normal but there were others where there was a shadow.  She went away to consult with a OB-GYN for agreement before she came back to talk through what would happen next.  Meanwhile my SO and I, probably in shock, had a bit of a nervous giggle.  She came back and explained we were being referred to a fetal medicine unit (FMU) for more thorough scans of the entire baby.  She said they would take independent measurements and look at the whole thing from scratch.  She then also said the words most people dread to hear which was the combination of more than one issue usually suggests a genetic problem so we should consider if that is something we want to investigate.  On the other side she made it sound like surgery on a newborn was a piece of cake and in all likelihood these conditions were easily correctable.  

We were a bit stunned.  Not telling our 4 year old he is going to be a big brother then.  Not saying anything to most people.  I had a meeting already booked with my line manager (whom I hadn't told I was pregnant yet) where I had to explain in the same breath I was pregnant but we were having to have more scans as there could be some issues.  I told three close friends whom I had told we were going for a scan that there were complications and we were having more scans.  

And then I waited for a call from the FMU to set the appointment.  The next day they said they would see me first thing in two days time.  The wait felt like an age.  That said we were still blissfully ignorant of exactly how serious it all was and I avoided Dr Google so I didn't upset myself.  

Friday came, we went to the scan.  The fetal cardiology scan was first.  They asked me if I minded if a trainee was allowed to carry out the initial part of the scan.  I am always happy for people to learn and to help out.  However there were also 2 consultants and an additional junior doctor so, in total 4 doctors crowded round the monitor, sometimes blocking the view of the screen on the wall.  I felt very frustrated by the end of it, especially there was lots of muttering (which as someone who is hard of hearing and with everyone wearing masks it was just impossible to judge whether it was a good or a bad sign).  Eventually one of the consultant say ""That's what I was hoping to see..."" to which my SO thought was a positive sign.  

By the end of the scan I was feeling quite sore.  They pressed along my scar from my previous c-sections and were pressing hard because of my weight.  What was more distressing was this was just the first scan.  They took us into a side room to explain what their findings were.  The consultant drew a ""normal"" heart (all of which I remembered from my secondary school days) and then he drew what was going on with our baby's heart.  He diagnosed a complete balanced AVSD (atrioventricular septal defect).  He said part of the valves were missing and there was a hole in the lower section and likely (although they didn't see to confirm) in the upper section.  He then explained it is commonly associated with Trisomy 21 and while there are ""good"" outcomes for surgery which usually happens around 3-6 months it depends on what else is going on as well.  He left us to take in the information and said they would come for us to do the second scan shortly.  

Second scan was a bit less brutal and quieter in terms of personnel.  That said the monitor on the wall was angled in such a way that all I could see was a blur so I felt like I was just lying there with everyone knowing what was going on but me.  The consultant took all the necessary measurements, saw the ""double bubble"" and confirmed it was duodenal atresia.  She couldn't confirm the cleft lip.  She decided it was a shadow from something else but got another consultant to check for a second opinion.  While she left the room to fetch the other consultant they left us in the room with the image of the baby's face on the screen.  

Once she confirmed the duodenal atresia we asked questions about what that meant but overall everyone kept saying unless we understood the genetic issues they couldn't give us a meaningful plan or prognosis.  

We talked with a midwife, after holding each other and crying (mostly me), and decided we should probably have an amnio for a quick and definitive diagnosis and should we decide not to continue with the pregnancy we needed a diagnosis soon.  They gave us the weekend to be sure we wanted one, especially as they wouldn't be able to send it for analysis until the following week anyway.  

The amnio came on a Wednesday.  We rushed from dropping the kids at school and nursery up to the hospital and then waited in the waiting room anxiously.  The midwife explained that we would have a scan and double check things and then they would perform the amnio.  However the scan bit was very short.  The consultant checked his heartbeat and then realised that the conditions were good so moved quickly to perform it before baby moved and made it more risky.  In order to take my mind off things they asked us about a holiday we had been on and ended up talking for 5 minutes about ice cream flavours.  The whole time I kept my eyes shut and wiggled my toes (someone recommended it on here and if anything it gave me something else to focus on).  I didn't feel too much pain, just a bit achy afterwards and I spent the afternoon on the sofa playing computer games.   2-3 working days to get the results so I felt that probably we were looking at not hearing anything until Monday 

Thursday 6pm my phone starts ringing while we are getting the children ready for bed.  The midwife didn't want to make us wait any longer than necessary and the results had just come through.  Positive for T21.  It just felt like a perfect storm where nothing was going in a more positive direction.  It seemed every conversation or journal article I read uncovered another possibility of something being worse.  

I tried to look for positive outcomes with all three conditions.  I trawled through down syndrome groups, message boards and journal articles and it was very slim pickings.  Any sign of both conditions either had a sad ending or the heart issue was less complicated.  Some reported the heart diagnosis improving over time but they didn't have the associated bowel issues.  We had some tough conversations but really didn't feel like the doctors had given us the full picture.  

The midwife tried to arrange some more people to talk to.  A pediatric cardiac nurse and a down syndrome specialist nurse.  While writing this today we spoke with the cardiac nurse and very quickly she said it was clear that we needed to talk to a consultant as what we wanted to know was more involved than she could give us.  She answered some questions around feeding (possible need for a gastric tube long term), time in hospital, medication and the important one- could the picture improve between now and birth with the heart.  No.  The nature of the AVSD, the common valve and the hole is just not going to improve.  

The midwife phoned to say she would arrange for one of the consultants to ring who has experience in multiple areas.  As soon as I put the phone down to her he rang.  He was frank and clear about everything.  I finally felt like someone was tying up all the loose ends and putting the jigsaw puzzle together (if you can excuse this rather mixed metaphor!).  He explained the likely plan.  He agreed the cardiac problem was unlikely to show any improvement and also that with Downs syndrome in the mix other issues might manifest themselves over the third trimester.  He explained the plan would be to treat the duodenal atresia surgically first, which would mean likely 2 weeks in hospital, maybe longer if there are complications.  The baby would then need to be at 2-3kg in order to be strong enough for heart surgery.  If there are other heart complications then it might be the heart surgery comes first.  This is then further complicated by if the duodenal atresia causes polyhydramnios and therefore there is a pre-term birth.  Add to that a 60 times higher chance of stillbirth.  He didn't suggest it was impossible but the picture he painted was clear.  

I am not afraid of cognitive deficits or even so much that my child would likely never leave home.  I have an autistic brother who I love and fully expect to have some hand in his care long term.  I don't however want to bring a child into this world to be drugged up and operated on and that to be the sum total of his existence.  I don't want to tell my children they are getting a baby brother but he is probably going to be very poorly or worse have to tell them he died before he was even born.  I don't want to miss out on the next year of their achievements and their life so wrapped up in getting to the next surgery or living in the hospital.  I have immense respect for the people who have taken on that challenge and if this were our first baby and I were 10 years younger I would probably face the challenge head on and take the risk of that heartbreak because it would be all on me.  

Now every morning I am waking, hoping that he doesn't move because every kick brings tears.  I want the decision taken out of my hands because its already so painful to bear.  I have no idea how to tell my family, some of whom didn't even know I was pregnant.  Likely we will lie and say it was a miscarriage just to make it easier for them to hear.  

I hope this story will help someone else down the line.  It's helped me to document it even if no one reads it.

Edit:  Just to say thank-you to those who have read and commented.  I appreciate your kind words and shared experiences.  It is a lonely road as no one else can make this decision for us.  We spoke with the Midwife about half an hour ago and asked her to start the process for TFMR.

Edit 2:  Thank-you again to everyone who has commented.  I appreciate the words of support.  I have tried to take time to reply to everyone regardless of their perspective because I really do value people sharing their stories and because someone in the future might also find value in them.  

I wanted to add on here (in case someone sees this post in the future but doesn't want to read all the comments) that I have had the subreddit r/tfmr_support recommended to me.  Already just scrolling through I can see it will be a supportive and helpful place just as r/Babybumps has always been.  

Also anyone in a similar situation in the UK there is an independent charity ARC (Antenatal results and choices) which has information for all choices people may make.  They push no agenda and they support people no matter what route they ultimately take.  I got lots of information there and will likely make use of some of their contacts and counselling.

Edit 3:  As there are still some people coming across this post I just wanted to add baby Oliver was born sleeping at 8.03am, 14th December 2020.  It was an intense but short labour.  It seems that my placenta was already failing (they described its condition as gritty) suggesting that he may not have been with us for much longer anyway.  He looked so tiny and frail but we were able to say goodbye.  Everyone took such excellent care of us and there are more opportunities for support coming.  We haven't decided whether to go down a burial, cremation or memorial route yet but thankfully there is no rush for us to decide yet.",558,117,2020-12-08,full term birth
BabyBumps,Graduated 40+4 | Dark | VERY LONG | Vacuum | Failed epidural | 4th deg. tear | Overall positive!,"Hi all!

When I look at the list of terms I've broken this experience down to in the post title (and when I think of the really low moments that I couldn't possibly boil down to a title tag), it's hard for me to believe that I would end it (emphatically!) with ""Overall positive!"" But it was. I read a whole lot of birth stories on this sub over these past few months. I hope someone comes across this one one day and sees that a positive experience can be redeemed out of a birth full of trauma and feelings of failure. It was for me.

A lot of the birth stories I'd read (from much more reasonable women than me, I guess!) said something like ""Once I went into labor, I knew I needed all the rest I could get, so I went to bed!"" Well friends, once I went into labor I knew I needed all the rest I could get, so I stayed up for hours watching old seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race because I couldn't sleep. Also being woken up every half hour by intense pain is ... not my definition of rest.

So there I was, watching Jinkx Monsoon at dawn, texting my doula. She came over a few hours later, as my contractions had begun to assume a kind of rhythm. At this point, I thought I was handling the pain of contractions really well. I'd get quiet and close myself off. I told myself over and over again, ""I can do anything for one minute."" I thought that could be my mantra.

Because my water had begun to leak, we called my doctor's office as soon as they opened. Here's where things first started to go awry: he wasn't there. He was on vacation and would be OOO for the next five days. I absolutely loved my doctor and I was looking forward to having him deliver my baby. I had chosen him because he practiced low-intervention and unmedicated births. He was kind and patient and made me feel at ease. I knew he was going away, but I had gotten the dates completely wrong and believed he was already back. I steadied myself and tried not to panic, and trusted that our hospital would have a good OB backing him up.

When we got to the hospital I was 6 cm dilated. The contractions were getting a little tougher, but I felt my body and my will rise to the occasion. I was in a very positive frame of mind and loved the nursing staff tending to our room. I was happy to have my doula and my husband at my side. I handed over my birth plan and got ready to ride it all out.

Then things took a very sudden turn and escalated very, very quickly. It becomes kind of a blur from here on out. Within the span of a few minutes, I started to transition. Then very shortly thereafter, a doctor came in to break the forebag of water down low. Suddenly, ""I can do anything for one minute"" didn't mean anything to me anymore, because the minute never seemed to end. One contraction rolled into the next, and I felt no reprieve.

**This was a different species of pain.** The best I can put it is this: the pain of every contraction up to that point was like having to drink hot, hot water, and I thought that as the labor progressed, the water would get hotter and hotter until it was boiling. Not so. There came a point where suddenly it was no longer water; it was acid. The pain scrambled my brain. It made me mean and feral and unhinged. The intensity of the pain crashed up against the embarrassment I felt at giving up on my plan for an unmedicated birth. Each made the other feel even worse. I went absolutely crazy.

I begged for the epidural. Then after I got it, I started to weep looking at my husband and my doula, who had psyched me up for hours over a period of months, helping me prepare to do something I had then effectively run screaming from. I wept and kept saying over and over, ""I'm so sorry."" Here's the thing: Was I really sorry to them? Absolutely not! She got paid all the same and he would never have to experience this kind of pain! But the despair was so intense, I think I just had to externalize it, and that was the form it most easily took.

As soon as I was able to lay down again after the epidural was put in, the delivering OB came, checked me and said, ""We're ready to push."" I had absolutely not yet recovered from what had just happened. It had been a minute or two at most. I felt, desperately, that I needed to psych myself up, re-summon some strength, and experience the relief of the meds before I could think about pushing. It was all moving too fast.

And here's the thing: the relief of the meds never came. Not only did I not feel any numbness from the waist down (which, it was explained to me, is apparently no longer how epidurals work) I didn't even feel any less pain. Many many times during pushing I would scream that I was feeling everything, that it hadn't worked, that I needed more, that I needed help. It didn't make me ""comfortable."" It didn't even restore my sense of sanity, or that I was a human woman rather than a psychotic animal. I insisted it had failed; the staff insisted it had not.

I asked my doula how long pushing would take (I realize, only now, what a stupid question that was) and she told me first time moms usually push between 1 and 3 hours. I pushed for over 5. The doctor came in after about 45 minutes and scolded me for wasting my energy pushing poorly. Normally I'm someone who is terrified of speaking up for herself, but at that point I'm pretty sure I didn't even know my own name and address anymore, and I started to yell back at her. I was angry and it was pretty clear I had made her angry, too. The thought even crossed my mind at one point to ask for a different doctor. My patience was so razor thin, I just did not believe I could tolerate the pain and her bedside manner at the same time.

But even in the fucking pain cave from hell, fear of conflict got the better of my people-pleaser ass, and I kept pushing. The experience was like a horrible psychedelic trip taking place during the worst flu of my life. To my absolute disbelief, I was losing consciousness and falling asleep for short intervals between cycles of pushing. I started to hallucinate. Time was moving very fast and very slow. I remember looking at my husband's watch at 6:50 PM and thinking, ""I'm going to get this baby out in the next 10 minutes. And then we're going to watch Jeopardy.""

&#x200B;

Reader, I did not.

&#x200B;

The thing that got to me the most was hearing the exact same rah-rah phrases over and over every few minutes for hours. At some point I had to beg them all to stop counting to 10. The repetition of it was making me insane. The OB was in and out. I was in and out. Nurses changed shifts. I have a distinct memory of singing to comfort myself in front of everyone, but everyone I've asked has told me it didn't happen.

I read a birth story once where the mother said the pain was so terrible and made her dissociate so hard, she stopped caring that she was having a baby. That was me. I am so fucking grateful I read that beforehand, because it helped me feel more forgiving of myself when that same thought occurred to me. I thought about jumping out the window. I thought about jumping down off the bed and slamming my head against the floor. I thought about things that, I feared, if I said them out loud they would send a social worker down to the room to collect my baby if it ever came out. **\*I just want you all to know that if you have a moment (or thirty) like this, I understand and it is absolutely fucking okay, and so are you, and it just makes me reflect on what an incredible capacity for both suffering and joy we have. To think we can call upon the highest and lowest of each in one single day is incredible to me.\***

I accessed a new wave of energy at a certain point. If they wanted me to push 3 times, I could push 4. I told them over and over I was ready and I wanted to go again. I was motivated. There came a point where the baby's heart rate was decelerating, and my blood pressure was sky rocketing, and I had given all I had. The baby had been close to crowning for so long. The doctor asked if I would like to try to use a vacuum. I agreed. The doctor asked if I would like to try a pudendal stop, which I guess is a local anesthetic. I agreed. They kept giving me what felt like shot after shot after shot. She explained that they would try the vacuum, and if it popped off three times, I had to go and have a c-section. I agreed to that, too. It popped off twice. Both times were some of the worst sounds I had ever heard in my life. But for how hard I had just HATED the doctor and cursed her bedside manner, when I saw how confident and capable and expert she was handling so much and so many people and such a high-tension moment ... I ""got"" her. I trusted her and I was grateful to have ended up with her there, and I gave myself over to her confidence.

I was under so much stress it felt like a train whistle was blaring inside my head. She cut me and I swore I could hear the scissors. Then the machine started back up again. I was both hyper-aware and barely-aware when all of a sudden I felt a great red weight hit my chest, and there was my son. Eight pounds and change, and a ton of blonde hair. Whatever relief I didn't get from the epidural, I felt it one-hundred times over in that moment.

My doula told me it was one of the longest repair jobs she had ever been party to. Having been party to zero, myself, I believe her. On top of the episiotomy, I had a fourth-degree tear. One of the doctors stitching me up was wearing these large retro eyeglasses, and when I looked down I realized I could clearly see my completely gutted vagina in the reflection of his lens. After everything that had happened, I just laughed. It was high comedy to me. Plus I guess I was a little delirious.

In the end, I held my son and I cried and cried. I had been ashamed when I asked for the epidural because I thought I had failed to work as hard as I'd committed to. I'm going to have to do some breaking down of why I thought I **had** to suffer as much as possible in order for my birth to be a success. But I cried tears of happiness and overwhelm when all was said and done because I knew that, in so many more ways than one, I had worked harder and stretched myself further than I ever had and ever would again — and asking for the epidural, asking for *help*, was not a break from that; it was a *part of that.*

After all that, my son is the sweetest, easiest baby. [Here he is right here.](https://imgur.com/a/an291DD) He makes me so happy. Ultimately, I have no regrets about his birth, and I would do it all over the exact same way to end up where I did.

BONUS 4TH DEGREE TEAR STUFF:

Some late night googling told me that I had an uphill climb ahead of me with a 4th degree tear. Seeing words like ""colostomy bag"" and ""anal incontinence"" frankly really terrified me. \*But for anyone reading this because they've had a 4DT themselves, looking for a bit of hope and a positive story among all the scarier stuff:\*

\-The incision healed quickly and well

\-I sat at an awkward angle for a few days, more so out of fear than physical discomfort, but was back to normal on my couch soon after

\-I shit successfully a day after coming home, and it was pain free. Ask for Miralax in the hospital and keep taking it once you get home. I had some hemorrhoids that developed a week or so later. Take a sitz bath once a day (or more! i know it's tough to make time but they don't actually have to be as long as you're told they do — and anything helps) and [try this.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005C55HPG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) They sucked.

\-I was taking walks with my stroller by the end of the week

\-My vagina has come a long way since it's horrific star turn in that guy's glasses, and it pretty much looks the same

BabyBumps,"NIPT and genetics, what you need to know","This is a post I wrote over at infertilitybabies but I thought it would be useful for many people, even the non IVF bumpers. If this kind of post is not allowed let me know! I just want to use my knowledge for good.

Edit: My edits below build on some great info from users at infertilitybabies. Thanks! 

After a post on one of my bumper groups (for IVF) worrying about trisomy at 13 weeks after a good NIPT, I realized that many people don’t actually understand fully why certain tests are done and others are not. Or what kind of information they should expect to get. So, here is some information from your friendly neighborhood genetics professor:

**Why don’t we do a full karyotype and look at all the chromosomes during NIPT?** *edited to reflect how PGT is done and detail about monosomy* If you did PGS/PGT, a karyotype was done on a sampling of the outer layer of cells to see if they have all their chromosomes in the correct number. This will become the placental tissue and is occasionally different in dna makeup than the fetal tissue. If you have an untested embryo, it is true that most miscarriages are caused by trisomies (3 instead of 2 copies of a chromosome) or monosomies (only one copy of a chromosome). Most monosomies are fatal and will not implant or will rapidly end in miscarriage during the first trimester. For trisomies, not all are created equal. Some trisomies, of larger chromosomes, mean that the fertilized egg arrests and does not divide. Most trisomies will cause a loss 4-8 weeks, because the error is not big enough to prevent implantation, but the embryo cannot progress past a certain stage. Good news! If you have an embryo with a heartbeat past 8 weeks, you are past the majority of the trisomy risk. Therefore, testing for the trisomies that would have already ended a pregnancy is not useful after 10 weeks.

**How do the doctors know which is my blood and which is the baby’s?** *edited to reflect that cfDNA is from placenta, not actually fetal cells and math check.* NIPT blood is drawn no earlier than 10 weeks (and usually viability of the embryo is checked at the same time). Mom’s DNA in her blood is tucked safely in the nucleus. The test looks for cell free DNA, which is commonly from the placenta (as noted, not actually fetal, but often reflects the fetal dna). Basically, they put markers into the sample that latch onto bits of DNA. First, they look for markers that tell them cfDNA is present (a good sign). If above 4% of the cfDNA is identified as fetal (from the placenta), then they add markers to identify snippets on chromosome 18/21/13 and XY. Basically, they expect that you will have about 1/23 of the sample be from each chromosome type. If they see that number jump for any of those, it could indicate higher risk for trisomy.

**What’s special about chromosome 18/13/21?** *edited to note that monosomy X is more severe* Those are the “survivable” trisomies. Remember, the risk of most trisomies ends around 10 weeks, as the fetus cannot develop past a certain point. I lost a baby to Trisomy 7, and she never developed past 6 weeks. But trisomy 18 (Patau Syndrome) and 13 (Edward’s syndrome) can develop into the third trimester and cause unsurvivable abnormalities. Basically, the infants emerge with severe health issues and die within a few hours to weeks. Many terminations for medical reasons are done for those two trisomies because the parents do not wish to subject themselves and the baby to a short life. Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21), is survivable past infanthood, but can be devastating and severe or only cause minor intellectual disability. Many parents choose not to roll that dice, or to at least have information about what would happen. 

Good news is that aneuploidy of the sex chromosomes is more survivable than others! Trisomy X causes tallness and mild learning issues in females it impacts. XYY males are sub fertile and more aggressive, XXY males have Kleinfelter’s which can cause a feminization of the body and are sub fertile. The only survivable monosomy is that of X. Note, possibly survivable. Monosomy X can cause late term loss and may not be fully survivable to term. If the child makes it to birth, it can cause a variety of health issues and full sterility. Many people born with it grow to adulthood without too much complication.

**I was told I have a high risk for trisomy with my NIPT result. Why do I need an amniocentesis or CVS too?** Remember, the way this works is they look for percentage of fetal DNA that is part of the chromosome of interest. If there is a low fetal fraction, it could be that, by chance, they find more chromosome 18 than expected. This can also happen by chance if the placenta (where the cfDNA comes from) is mosaic and has some cells that are trisomy 18/13/21. This can resolve as the pregnancy goes on. To be sure, you must get a sample of ONLY fetal DNA and do a more intensive DNA analysis. The line for “high risk for trisomy” is purposefully low in order to catch a high number of possible trisomies (you don’t have to have a ton of chromosome 18 to be flagged as higher risk). **As mentioned below, because of this, false positive rates can be high. This can be stressful for those who are recommended an amnio based on NIPT and find they were stressed over nothing. The purpose of this info is to help you be confident in good numbers and skeptical of bad until you have more info**

**Can NIPT miss trisomies?** Yes, but more than 99% of 18/13/21 and sex trisomies are caught by this test, as long as fetal cfDNA fraction is high. As there is a chance that the test could have more chromosome 18 than expected and be normal, there is also a chance that a normal fraction was found even if another test would show a high fraction.

I hope this helps you to be both confident in and skeptical of the NIPT results and to understand why the testing is limited to a certain set of chromosomes. Hope for happy and healthy results for all!",114,59,2020-08-31,full term birth
BabyBumps,Birth story: Baby River born 3/19 (39w4d) via emergency c-section; TW: birth injury/traumatic,"I've unintentionally written a novel, so apologies for the length - I guess writing it all out has been a bit cathartic. I started writing this while we were still in the hospital in March, and have come back to it on and off. Now that our son is two months old, it seems like a good time to wrap it up.

Our son River was born on March 19th at 8:31pm at 8 lbs. 9.6 oz. and 20.5"" long, after 4 minutes of emergency surgery. I was 39w4d at the time. 

No part of River's birth experience went ""according to plan,"" at all. Plan A was unmedicated vaginal birth. That option went away after we discovered that River was breech, and would not turn despite trying all the ways to get him head down (moxibustion, acupuncture, chiropractic, swimming, spinning babies, three separate ECVs with and without an epidural, etc.). I had an incredibly difficult time coming to terms with the necessity of a c-section birth. It was so hard for me to surrender all of our work and intentions to something that was out of our control. My husband and I had taken a very intensive hypnobirthing based class together, and a c-section felt like the ultimate disappointment. I actually had to stop listening to all of the hypnobirthing and meditation tracks I’d been using - they became reminders of the experience we weren't going to have, and it wasn't productive for me to think about that any longer.

Plan B was to let labor begin naturally, labor at home for a while with our doula, and then proceed to the hospital for a cesarean. 

Plan C was to have a scheduled cesarean at 41w1d on March 30th in the event labor hadn’t started before then. We didn't make it to plans B or C either. 

I started my maternity leave a week before my due date, on March 16th, just as everything was shutting down. I spent the beginning of the week meal prepping like crazy (so glad I did). Over the last several days of my pregnancy, I had noticed a slowing down of River's movement which I attributed to his growth and reduction in free space. He was moving as usual on Wednesday evening (18th), so I had no suspicion anything was off. On Thursday, it seemed as though there were fewer movements than there had been the day before. At about 4:30pm, I decided to try a kick count. I laid in bed and drank some cold seltzer. An hour later, I had felt no movement, so I had some juice. I felt a little panicked at that point. I called L&D at 6pm to ask what to do. They suggested more juice, and that I call back either in an hour or when I got concerned and wanted to come in. I called back at 7, and we decided to head in for a non-stress test. We checked into L&D at 7:45pm and they began monitoring me in triage shortly thereafter. 

The nurse found a heartbeat right away. Everything seemed generally fine, so they let me stay in my own clothes while they attached the sensors. River’s heart rate was consistent, which seemed reassuring. I even joked with the nurse about how this had been a good “practice run” in getting all our stuff ready and into the car. 

After a little less than 10 minutes of observation, a doctor came in to explain that she was concerned about the lack of variation in his heart rate, and that if there was no change with stimulation (she used a tiny vibrating tool around my belly to try and wake him up), we should move to surgery. I thought at the time that she was being a bit extreme. She called in some other colleagues. Everything went incredibly fast from there. 

The doctor made some additional observations and again said we needed to deliver the baby immediately. Within what felt like seconds, there were lots of people in the room, telling my husband to help pull off my clothes and get me into a gown. They warned me that there were about to be a lot of alarms going off and that a code would be called, and that it was for me. I don't think I really had enough time to process the urgency at that moment, and was just confused and concerned that everything seemed to be slipping away from my control. We were then wheeling quickly into the OR. I was told I would need to be placed under general anesthesia which was very upsetting at the time. My husband says that this is one of the moments that stands out in his memory of that night. Apparently when they first said they’d need to put me under, I cried out “No!” in the saddest way he’d ever heard. After getting in the OR, I kept asking if spinal was an option, and it felt like I was being ignored because everyone was moving so fast. Once I was on the table, I asked the anesthesiologist if we could please do a spinal instead. She asked everyone to stop a moment and let her know if there was time to place one. She was told no, there was no time. I felt resigned a little bit and mostly overwhelmed. The drape was going up, I had a nasal cannula going in. I felt the catheter being uncomfortably shoved (like really jabbed) into place and at the time thought they were being careless, but realize in hindsight just how much of an emergency we truly were in. 

I entered the OR at 8:21pm, the first incision was at 8:27, and River was born at 8:31. River experienced what’s called a massive fetal maternal hemorrhage, where blood from the fetus passes through the placenta and into the mother, rather than cycling back. He lost 66% of his blood volume into my body. As a result, his brain was deprived of oxygen, and he had a stroke. The hemorrhage itself isn't particularly uncommon, but the ""massive"" designation (when the fetus loses >50% blood volume) is. I later learned that the regional healthcare system I use (3 hospitals) sees only about 5 or 6 of these massive hemorrhages a year, not all of which result in live birth. 

To prevent any further brain injury, River was placed on a therapeutic cooling blanket within an hour of his birth in the NICU, which brought his body temperature down to 92.3 degrees. He remained on the blanket for three days to slow down his metabolic processes, and allow his brain to heal and rest. He also received multiple blood transfusions.

My husband was able to be with River as they got him set up and settled in the NICU. I woke up from surgery shortly afterwords, and we spoke with the pediatrician. I was so out of it I forgot the conversation (and being awake) entirely. I didn’t fully come to until about midnight, at which point I was alone in the recovery unit while my husband stayed with River. It was a surreal experience to be alone, to know that I had given birth, but to not know where my baby physically was. Eventually my husband rejoined me, and at around 12:30am, I was recovered enough for them to wheel me to the NICU so I could meet our son. I was able to reach over the edge of his bassinet to just barely touch him. It was very scary to see him for the first time like that, and to not be able to have much physical contact with him at all.

The next day, we met with more doctors than all the doctors I’ve ever seen in my lifetime, combined. They were all caring and compassionate and extremely supportive. The cooling therapy is a three day process. During that time, we couldn’t hold River. Visitor protocols due to COVID-19 were such that my husband and I couldn’t even be in the NICU room with him at the same time. He was on a ventilator, multiple IVs, heart monitors, brain activity monitors (EEG), he had a gastric suction tube, a core temperature probe, a catheter, etc. He was covered in tubes and tape and wires. Once the three day cooling was over, he would be rewarmed over the course of at least 6 hours. From there, we had to wait for an MRI on Monday to know anything about the extent of his brain injury. For those first three days, he was so sedated that he barely moved and didn’t make any sounds. It was hard for both me and my husband to bond with him in those first days because it felt almost too risky - what if he died? 

It was an incredibly difficult four days for us to wait, in complete uncertainty, to learn what kind of future River might have ahead. Without an MRI taken after the rewarming process was completed, the doctors weren't able to tell us anything about possible outcomes. The full spectrum from death to minor, insignificant impacts were on the table. It felt as though we had been robbed of the joy of our child’s birth - there were no happy moments those first few days. Hearing the cries of other babies in the maternity unit was at times unbearable.

I have to say that I think the only thing that got us through those days was our love for and commitment to one another, and a willingness to be radically vulnerable for and towards one another. It was essential for us to make space to listen to one another’s hopes and fears, to allow for the open expression of all thoughts or desires without any judgement, and to find moments of escape and comfort whenever possible. 

We spent Monday with River, waiting to hear back from the neurologist and also terrified of receiving her call. Fortunately, we received good news. River does have a brain injury in his left hemisphere. The hasty surgery saved his life, and the cooling therapy was successful in limiting the damage. Because the damage is hemispheric, the other side of River's brain may be able to rewire and/or compensate for some of it. At worst, River may have some minor motor skills issues in his right arm and face, there's a possibility he'll have a learning disability, and he's at greater risk for developing epilepsy. Or, best case he’ll have left side dominance, which could manifest as something like being left handed. Overall the future looks incredibly bright. When we got off the phone with the neurologist, I immediately started weeping. It felt like it had given us permission to have hope, and to open our hearts fully to our child. 

We were able to bring River home on April 1st, after 14 days in the NICU. Those two weeks at the hospital every day were tough, but so much better once we knew he was going to be ok. It was very strange coming home at night without our baby, and sometimes felt like we weren’t “really” parents yet. I did have one meltdown about a week after he was born where I just wept inconsolably about having to leave him as we packed up to go home for the night. 

When I was trying to come to terms with a planned cesarean, people kept telling me that once I had my baby in my arms, it wouldn't matter any more how he was born or came into this world. Prior to River's birth, I couldn't relate to that - the experience of the birth was important to me, and I didn't want it to be a secondary consideration or a means to an end. Now, I understand it differently. It was so hard in the moment to focus singularly on the goal of a healthy baby because labor and birth are something that seem so monumental that we spend so much time thinking about and preparing for, but once I got to the other side that changed for me. In an ideal world, I would have delivered River according to our Plan A, but it doesn't really feel like it matters any more because even though everything went sideways we still have a beautiful, healthy, living child to love and care for.  

That said, I have had difficulty not feeling at times like I “missed” the birth of our son. It’s hard to hear other birth stories sometimes, I’ve had to turn off the radio or tv when something birth related comes on. I started talking to a therapist, and am hoping to work through processing my experience going forward. 

It's been strange to be sheltering in place since River's birth, to say the least. Our parents (from NY and NJ) had to cancel their plans to come visit and help us. We've held River up to our living room window for a few friends who have dropped off food, but support has otherwise come in the form of Grubhub gift cards, texts, emails, and video chats. Our doula still has my (dehydrated) placenta - not actually sure when I'll even get it from her at this point. We're not really going outside the house aside from essential doctors visits and walks around the neighborhood. 

To add to all of this, my grandmother who took care of me every day of my childhood, passed away before River was out of the NICU. Then, at the end of April, my father died of COVID-19. Then (kind of can’t believe myself that there’s still a “then”), my husband developed diverticulitis, an intestinal infection and was bedridden for a week and a half, THEN he developed C.diff, another more painful infection which knocked him out another week. Then we had to temporarily move out of the house we rent because the landlord discovered one of the power lines has melted and she needed to get someone in to rewire the whole place so it wouldn’t burn down. Then the cat gnawed his feet raw and ran away (we found him). A part of me is amazed we’re all still alive and doing relatively well, considering. My hope is that one day we can look back on this time and feel invincible. 

If I had it all to do again, I would spend more time during my pregnancy focusing and meditating on releasing control. I wish I hadn’t been so focused on designing the experience I wanted, and instead had prepared more emotionally for the surrender that’s required. My only advice to others would be to listen to your body and your instincts, trust yourself and your baby, and as much as possible be ready and receptive to changes in ""the plan.”

As far as postpartum goes, it’s been rocky at times. We slept in shifts the first two weeks at home and between the breastfeeding and bottle supplementing and pumping constantly and pressure from visiting nurses to increase weight gain, we were a stress-mess. I have to sometimes remind myself to enjoy the moment, and to enjoy River right now, and to focus less on milestones and potential indicators of his injury manifesting itself, because it’s not productive and won’t change whatever comes next. It’s hard not to compare and worry all the time. But right now he is cute and smiley and engaging more with us every day so I try to take it one day at a time. 

For those of you who haven't given birth yet, I wish you all the best for healthy, happy babies and empowering birth experiences.",248,29,2020-05-30,full term birth
BabyBumps,"STM Birth Story! TW: HELLP, nearly died, okay now!","I am emotionally good, but physically, it was a very traumatic birth. I feel like my doctors/nurses/midwives took EXCELLENT care of me, advocated for my health. But, in a sea of ""natural labor / happy induction / scheduled C / positive birth!"" Someone might benefit from reading a ""when things go wrong"" post. Warning, if you do NOT want to read about Scary Things That Could Nearly Kill You, this is not the birth story for you :) 

My [first birth](https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/c082a7/birth_story_induction_epidural/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) was an induction just shy of 37 weeks, after gestational hypertension developed into preeclampsia. It was a unicorn labor and delivery, and I loved every second of it. She did break my tailbone, though, and so when we knew we were having another baby right at a year later, I opted to go for a cesarean to avoid a repeat fracture. A few weeks of postsurgical recovery is much preferable than a year or lifetime of pelvic pain and limited ability playing with my girls. 

Baby #1, all the complications. Super high risk. This baby, nothing. Not even morning sickness. My 33 week visit, my midwife was joking about how I was just waiting for the shoe to drop, but to fully expect to make it to my scheduled C at 39+4 if I didnt go into spontaneous labor before that. Baby was big, and my orthopedic pains were no joke, but my BP, bloodwork, all the scary complications were fantastic. 

33.5, I start complaining of what I think is late-term morning sickness. I'm nauseous, started throwing up, I generally feel hungover. Its 100 degrees (38c), 99% humidity, and I am the size of a planet chasing after a newly-sprinting toddler. I'm probably just dehydrated, shrug it off. Rotating midwife I don't know well assures me that's all it is.

34 weeks, it's not going away. I have a splitting headache, I am swollen, and I can't stop puking. Head to Triage; they tell me my BP is fine (120/70) and send me home with a 24-hour urine catch to perform.

34.5, I see my favorite doctor, he tells me I have preeclampsia from protein in the urine. It's ""shockingly""  high but my BP is fine.  I go on bed rest, and am told to come in if I feel the SLIGHTEST bit more ""like garbage."" I go to the Triage 2 more times, to be sent home because my BP is fine. 

35+6, I visit my favorite midwife. This lady birthed my older daughter, she has happened to be on call for a lot of my scary appointments previously, she knows me and my whole (extended) family well. We're BFFs. I walk into the room, feeling like garbage (but what else is new)? She takes one look at me and says, ""You look like death. I think it's baby day."" Granted, this is me in a mask. She has me take it off, and my lips are stark white. My eyes are swollen, my face is blotchy, my BP is...fine. She says she doesn't care what my BP is, I likely have developed HELLP without a high blood pressure. I need to go get labs and confirm and then they will likely deliver today - otherwise, I am finishing bed rest in the hospital. 

I get to the hospital and am hooked up to monitors, and get labs. They debate giving me another proteinuria test (what is the point, they know mine is sky-high) and take serial BPs (120s/60s and 70s). I am actively puking, despite not having eaten yet that morning, I am clammy, someone wonders if I have COVID. My midwife comes in and fusses that they haven't called the OB since clearly I am deteriorating, fast. She asks for an IV to get placed since she is convinced that once it's confirmed, I will need to go NOW. Five minutes later, my second-favorite OB comes in. I don't know him well but I like his style; he is cautious and thorough. He comes in and looks at me, looks at my chart, looks at Midwife, and says - we don't have time to wait for labs. This is HELLP; no way can we wait any longer. 

Twenty minutes later, my baby is out of my body. I am awake, and for all intents and purposes, the C-section itself was the same as a scheduled one. My husband was allowed in the room, I didn't have to wear a mask, they lowered the screen when they pulled her out, and I got skin to skin while they stitched me up. 

Baby Cecily is 35+6, but weighs 7 lb 10 oz and came out squalling. She had Apgar scores of 9, and was great in her initial evaluations. 

While I was holding her, I started feeling dizzy. I handed off baby, and by the time I had handed her off, my BP plummeted. The anesthesiologist pushed Benadryl and some other medicines, and a few minutes later, I was better. They finished stitching me up and sent me back to the Labor and Delivery side for a magnesium drip and care until I was stable enough to handle the postpartum ward. 

I had a ""honeymoon period"" of about 12 hours. Baby was able to latch and breastfeed, and we had a good few hours. They ended up taking her back to the NICU after her blood sugars dropped in the night, and I got to sleep. I woke up in the morning and got to get off my magnesium drip. At about 10am, I was happy, sitting up in the bed, and the nurses wanted to move me to postpartum. I wanted to get up and visit baby, too, and I had heard that the recovery goes faster if you can get up and walk ASAP. 

I stood up OK, and made it to the bathroom. I felt like I was running a marathon, but pushed through. I sat down on the toilet, and IMMEDIATELY felt like I was having heat stroke, times a thousand. My chest closed off, my vision went white, my head felt like it was caving in and burning, and I started violently puking - which, let me tell you, immediately after a c-section was pure hell. 

Apparently, I coded. The nurse called in backup, they got me to the bed, and I started to convulse. I felt like I was out of my body - I could hear them trying to resuscitate me, and asking me to respond, but I couldn't get my body to answer. Midwife came in, calm and in control, and helped calm down my sobbing husband, getting him to consent to some scary questions. She told him my labs came back, full-blown HELLP, and that they had done magnesium and prophylactic treatment to try and keep it from escalating any worse - but at this point, it was grim. Labs also discovered I was severely anemic, so I needed a blood transfusion immediately. 

Two units of blood and 8 hours later, I woke up feeling a little better. I had some color back, I didnt have the world's worst hangover, and my labs were much better - still severely anemic but functional. 

Between Saturday and my discharge on Wednesday, I needed 4 blood transfusions. Every time I would get a little better, I would ask to visit the baby in the NICU. My husband had to go back to work (and take care of our older daughter) and I was sitting alone in the hospital room, thanks to Covid. I wanted to see the baby for a couple feedings a day, at the very least, so I could see her and hold her and let her know she wasn't all alone. But, each visit wore me out and inevitably I would deteriorate, pass out, and need another transfusion. 

Eventually my body healed enough and I could manage trips to see the baby without getting dizzy. I have been discharged after a 5-day stay, and my baby will be in the NICU for another week (at least). While her blood sugar has been fine since the first night, she started having breathing problems where she forgets to breathe, and desats. 

I am so thankful to be alive. I am so thankful for my baby to be alive, and that we both have access to good providers and medical treatment who can keep us from dying in childbirth. It has been a humbling experience; ""died in childbirth"" is very much a real, current concern that I never really considered prior to this experience.",217,26,2020-08-14,full term birth
BabyBumps,Do you feel normal at all during pregnancy?,"Hey all! FTM here. Currently 6+5 and in the full sweep of symptoms. The nausea, exhaustion, irritability, some vomiting. I know they say the first trimester is usually the hardest and it takes a lot of adjusting which I completely understand. My question is, am I going to feel “normal” at all through the next 9 months? Do we just wake up one day and feel good? Or is there just a new normal and you have to wait until you’re not pregnant anymore to go back to feeling like yourself? Just having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that my body and my mental health won’t go back to my normal until after I give birth. 9 months is a long time! Any input is appreciated.",10,42,2020-06-08,full term birth
BabyBumps,The hospital I've been going to is forcing all of the women to be induced at 39 weeks and I was wondering if this is normal?,"I'm currently 21 weeks pregnant and the hospital/OBGYN I've been seeing has made it a ""rule"" now that all women are to be induced at 39 weeks. I don't know if this is COVID related or if it has more to do with the fact that the OB department is severely lacking staff at this hospital and they just want things to be scheduled out. 



I'm not sure how I feel about this though regardless of what their reasoning is, I'm not super gung-ho on ""everything has to be natural"" philosophy but I do feel like it's just unnecessary and that a baby will make their arrival when they're ready. Unless I had some medical issue where they had to induce or went a week or more past my due date, I get it. But to just say ""you have no choice over how you birth"" seems really...wrong. By the time I'm full term I'll have an 18 month old and I'd rather labor at home for as long as possible so we're not gone from her very long and I have no idea what their covid response will be to having her come after the baby arrives. 


The next closest hospital is an hour away and I haven't called them yet to see what their policies are but I definitely plan on it. I just don't like them being so far either...I don't know I guess this is sort of a rant but what would your thoughts be on this and induction in general?",22,31,2020-08-20,full term birth
BabyBumps,Birth story from my first pregnancy.,"I wanted to share this in case it helps someone else understand their own labor when the time comes. The midwife and the internet will tell you to prepare for a longer labor for your first and not to expect your water to break on its own. No one thinks to tell you what a fast labor would feel like though. It's pretty different. This was 2 years ago but here's how I remember it. 

About 6am. Im 37wks on the day. I wake up with mild aching in my lower stomach. I can't sleep through it though so I get up. I've been up long about to pee and let the dog out. The feeling has moved around to my lower back now and is mildly uncomfortable. I think I spent about 30 minutes on the birth ball thinking that its too early for labor and itll probably go away. I wasn't timing my contractions. They were fairly far apart. I decide to try a shower to see if they will stop. 

The shower feels great. I barely feel the contractions. Im thinking they'll go away.

7:15am my water breaks while drying off. I waddle myself to the sink and get the adult diapers I had for after birth and tell my husband its go time. Poor guy had literally just packed up his work apartment 2hrs away and moved back home from the project 12hrs before. 

I call the midwife and she says ok well we've got plenty of time. Let me know when you feel like heading to the birth center. (Its an hour away) 

I go back to the birth ball and start timing contractions. They are getting more intense but they aren't consistent in timing. 1 to 5 minutes apart. Lasting 15 seconds to a minute. My mom thinks I've got time too since they are inconsistent. She's going to take a shower instead of come to my house. (She's a labor and delivery nurse) 

At some point I feel like I need to potty so I move back to the bathroom. Thats when I see that I've been bleeding. Now I've got to send icky toilet pictures to my mother and midwife. It's mucusy though which means it's fine and not hemorrhaging or something like that. It does seem like a lot. My husband will say it looked like a crime scene.  

I can barely talk through the contractions now. They both agree that I'm probably not going to make it to the birth center or them to me. So we decide to head to the local hospital. Midwife calls ahead for me. 

On the drive there I already feel like pushing. Trying not to push is like running into a wall repeatedly. Its hard to breath through too. 

Get to the hospital about 10am. They check me in. Stranger doctor comes to check me and I'm complete so they move me to a room.

10:45 im holding my son. (I think I could have been faster but those nurses just took their sweet time setting up and then acted like they were waiting on me when I asked if I could push yet) 

The experience was a bit scary for us prior to arriving at the hospital and having someone actually look at me and say everything was fine. No one told us how much blood or that any blood really would be involved but apparently that's normal when you progress that fast. My contractions didn't progress at a steady pace and give me time to comes to terms with the stages of labor. They just went full speed ahead. 

With all that said, I did it without medication and I truly hope my next labor is that fast and furious.",113,16,2020-11-14,full term birth
BabyBumps,I’m late but here is my sweet Lily. We are finally home after 77 days in the NICU. She was born at 27 weeks 4 days gestation after a traumatic emergency delivery. She weighed 2lbs 10oz. Here she is today at a chunky 8lbs 4oz! Any preemie moms on here?,,1238,166,2020-08-26,late delivery
BabyBumps,I graduated! Didn't realize I was in labour!,"FTM. I did not think this is how my birth story would go, but here we are! A very positive story!

I woke up at 2am on August 11th at 38+1 feeling a bit crampy. I figured it was just more Braxton Hicks, so went back to sleep. I woke up again at 3am needing to pee, and noticed the cramps hadn't stopped. They were quite mild - not as bad as my usual period cramps even. So I went back to bed, and casually mentioned the cramps to my boyfriend. He freaked out and insisted on timing the cramps. I told him I wasn't in nearly enough pain for it to be labour, but let him time them. Each cramp was lasting about a minute, and they were about 4 minutes apart. 

At this point, my boyfriend was certain baby was coming. Meanwhile, I was ready to get back into bed. He kept asking me to call L&D and I agreed to, thinking I'd be able to go back to sleep after. The nurse I spoke with said it was hard to say over the phone, and recommended having a bath. I relayed this information to my boyfriend, and told him we should go back to bed since he had to work in the morning. But no, he made me go to the hospital to get checked. I told him we'd just get sent home, but off we went. 

We got to the hospital, and I went through triage. I walked up a couple flights of stairs to L&D, grumbling to my boyfriend about how women in labour go up the elevator in a wheelchair - they certainly don't walk up the stairs. We got to an examination room, and the nurse came in to check me. She looked confused, asked me to rate my pain, and called in another nurse. This nurse also looked confused. They whispered to each other, then told me I was 8cm dilated. So much for going back to bed.

I was rushed through the admitting paperwork, and then walked down the hall to a delivery room. The nurse told me it was too late for any pain relief, and called the doctor. The doctor came in and broke my water. I was warned that my contractions would get more intense at this point. It was a bit more painful, but still nothing major. I immediately felt the urge to push, and my baby was born at 7lb 12oz and 19in long, less than an hour later. Three and a half hours after I'd initially woken up with some mild cramps. I had no tearing or any other complications. 

It was overall very positive, but really strange. The experience was so far from what I expected, that I don't think I ever really truly believed I was in labour. Then suddenly, I had my baby on my chest. I think I was in shock. If not for my boyfriend insisting that I go to the hospital, I'm 100% sure I would have given birth in my kitchen. 

Side note: I had really bad PPA and PPD after taking my baby home. I finally opened up to a public health nurse, and was able to get help. It was really hard to reach out and be vulnerable, but I'm so so glad I did. The medical professionals I talked to were nothing but supportive, reassuring, and helpful. I'm upset that I let myself suffer longer than I needed to, and wish I'd gotten help sooner. Please monitor yourself for symptoms of PPA and PPD. And please please please reach out to a medical professional as soon as you feel like you need some help.",1206,144,2020-09-21,late delivery
BabyBumps,36w3d Partial Induction (Mostly) Natural Birth Vaginal Delivery w/ Placental Abruption...Very late birth story from last year!,"TW: Mention of possible MC in first paragraph 

So my pregnancy was pretty much amazing...I loved being pregnant! I went through one week of nausea, I had an MC scare weeks 5-7ish because I was bleeding bright red blood, I ended up having a subchorionic hematoma and actually spotted until week 13, I ended up getting the Rhogam shot early because of that since I was Rh-, but after that everything was pretty much smooth sailing besides some intense hip pain near the end.

At 35 weeks, my midwife measured my bump, like they had been my entire pregnancy, and she told me that it had not grown from the previous week. According to her, this was likely nothing to worry about (she could’ve just measured it differently from the previous midwife I saw) but just to be safe they would schedule me for a growth ultrasound. There wasn’t an ultrasound appointment available until after my next prenatal appointment at 36 weeks. I went to my next appointment one week later at 36 weeks and my bump had still not grown. The midwife I saw this time said their office dropped the ball and I should’ve had my ultrasound before this appointment. My midwife sent me with a script to the hospital so that I could have my ultrasound right away and be monitored for a few hours. 

My husband and I drove straight to the hospital and headed to the labor and delivery floor…Was not expecting to see this place for at least a few more weeks! While I was waiting for my ultrasound, they hooked me all up and told me I was having contractions one minute apart and my blood pressure was reading high (my BP was also taken at my OBs but they did not say it was high). They asked me a few more questions about things I had been experiencing (I told them I occasionally see little flurries and called my OBs nurse about it, but she said since my BP was normal it was nothing to worry about) and then during my hour long ultrasound I began to have the worst back pain I had ever experienced (I will get to that later!). After all of this, they decided to induce me since my baby was not growing anymore and was measuring on the smaller side (5lbs, in the 1st percentile) and I was diagnosed with atypical preeclampsia. Well, time to send hubby with a huge list of things to grab from the house because we did not have our hospital bags packed! (I will definitely be packing very lightly next time because we hardly used any of it 🤣)

Hours passed before I was induced. The plan was for me to get 1-2 rounds of Cervadil and then start Pitocin. I had another ultrasound focused on the blood flow from the placenta and was continuing to have contractions every minute (thankfully they were not too bad yet, though the back pain was almost unbearable, I mentioned this to the midwife who was there and she didn’t give me any answers, just said I would not be able to speak during “real” contractions).

Once my husband got back they were able to insert the Cervadil on the second attempt at 11:40pm (Apparently my baby’s head was in the way of my cervix, I still cannot make sense of that, but it was extremely painful and I was crawling away 😣). My cervix was closed at this point. We had 12 hours of waiting for the Cervadil to hopefully start the dilating process before they would start me on Pitocin. After a whole night of being awake from the increasingly painful contractions, I was silently begging for someone to check how dilated I was! My contractions were truly non stop, they would start, peak, go down, and instantly start again. I used nitrous oxide gas, but it didn’t do anything for me. Unfortunately, they decided to wait to check me until 11:40am. By 11:30am I was hitting my bed rails so hard from the pain and I told my husband “I cannot get through another contraction, get me an epidural!” (My plan was to go natural, but I was not prepared to get induced and was having a very difficult time getting through those contractions). My midwife FINALLY checked me and to her surprise (but not mine!) I was 5cm. They said I needed a bag of fluids and in 20 minutes they would insert the epidural. While lying in bed anxiously waiting for it, I started to feel a little someone try to push out of me. I let this go on for a couple of contractions because it was very hard for me to speak. Finally I used all of my energy to tell my husband and he grabbed the nurse who checked me and she got my midwife who confirmed I was 10cm. I yelled “Does this mean I can’t get an epidural?!”. Like most first time moms, I was absolutely terrified. I had no idea how to push and was not sure how I could survive with the amount of pain I was in. Somehow I gathered up the courage, my midwife broke my water and I instantly started pushing with every ounce of my being. 15 minutes later and he was in my arms 🥰 12:35pm! While pushing my midwife had me try a few things, but the thing that worked the best was pulling on a towel while she gave resistance on the other end. I did not prepare for a natural birth at all, all I knew is that I wanted to labor on a yoga ball, the tub, anywhere besides my back, but I stayed on my back the ENTIRE labor and delivery because NO ONE believed I was in “active labor” until they checked my dilation, despite the intense pain I was in. I had a one degree bilateral labial tear that they stitched up. 

At my 6 week postpartum appointment I found out the reason for my high blood pressure, back pain and super frequent contractions. Oddly enough, no one told me until this point that I had a placental abruption and if I were to be anywhere else other than the hospital I most likely would’ve lost my son. My placenta was half the size of a normal placenta and was pushing out before my baby. Although this only occurs in 1% of pregnancies it does make me nervous for next time! I was also told that only 1% of woman can get to 10cm and pushing with only round of Cervadil, but my body was really “helping” things along because of my placental abruption. 

So, after a partial induction (I didn’t need pitocin since my body was naturally going into labor early due to the abruption), a labor that went completely unplanned (I was looking forward to laboring in the tub!) and a rare complication, I ended up with my perfect baby boy 💙 He had to overcome some challenges of his own, he was Coombs positive, had low blood sugars and jaundice. The heel pricks he had every two hours were terrible, and having to be under the phototherapy light for 12 hours was even worse, my husband I did not sleep our entire stay. Breastfeeding was also very hard, but that’s another story, and I will say I’m still nursing my boy 16.5 months later! He was such a strong little guy from the start, and we only had to stay at the hospital 2.5 days. 

I hope it’s not strange that I shared my story so late, but I love reading others birth stories and I haven’t read another one quite like mine, so I wanted to share! And I’ll answer any questions! I admire all of the moms who are going through pregnancy and birth with covid going on! You are all incredible.",21,6,2020-07-19,late delivery
BabyBumps,Positive Birth Story for pregnant ladies out there,"I have graduated at 39+6, baby boy was just 1 day short of the 40 weeks. My husband was joking that I was having all the conversations with my belly about showing up on time and not keep mommy waiting too long lol

It was a usual day for us, we went to Walmart around 3 PM to get more baby stuff ( masks and all with social distancing of course). I felt some cramping that made me sweat, I thought oh well it can’t be the baby yet. 

Once we got home around 8 Pm my cramps went from 3-4 to 8-9 pain wise. I started screaming scaring the living hell out of my partner. The hospital is right across the road for us so I get dressed and start waddling in the hospitals direction while breathing really hard and whimpering like crazy.

We made it to the hospital around 9 PM and got into maternity ward. The nurses said they would examine me and give me shot of Morphein and send me home due to COVID. 

In the examination room while I was waiting for the morphein pain killer, my contraction went from 8 to full 10. I was screaming like a mad woman and they finally showed up with the shot. The nurse checked my Cervix and it was 9 cm dilated, so they noped on the morpheine and transferred me to delivery room while I was screaming for epidural or anything. 

Around 11 PM I was hooked up to a laughing gas which made things a bit better and given an IV and fentanyl. The epidural was getting delayed and by the time anesthesiologist showed up my son’s head was already coming out. The doctor told me to push and after 3 pushes my baby boy came out screaming at 1 AM

I had a very minor tear and a few little stitches and was able to walk and take care of my sweetie right away :) 

Overall my labour took 5 hours with only 30 minutes of pushing and it’s my first child! Everyone out there kept telling me that my baby will be late and that it will be a super long excruciating labour as I’m a FTM. I’m here to tell you that it’s not true and it all between you and your baby :) 

We have a perfect baby boy who started sleeping through the night at 2.5 months and is a happy little guy no purple crying and any of those other things you get warned about :)

Hope this happy story helps to alleviate some of the anxieties out there as I was extremely scared to give birth and it turned out great!",340,36,2020-10-31,late delivery
BabyBumps,Positive birth story despite covid-19 restrictions,"Hello, I gave birth to my first baby last month (!) and I wanted to share my birth story here, because it all went very smoothly, even though I spent most of the time by myself because my husband was only allowed in the hospital just before/after the baby came out due to the hospital's coronavirus policy. When I was pregnant I would try and read positive stories here to try and convince myself it wouldn’t necessarily be awful, so I wanted to share mine for anybody else nervous about giving birth or having to labor alone.  

tl;dr takeaway: Nothing was as horrible or painful as I worried/imagined it might be, whether it was having to spend most of my labor in the hospital by myself, the pain of contractions/delivery (I did not get an epidural even though I did have the option), or postpartum recovery with a small vaginal tear. Obviously everybody’s body and birth experience is different, but I had a relatively quick, non-traumatic and not exhausting birth even though it was my first pregnancy, so it is possible!

Background:

First-time mother, originally from the US but currently living in Japan, so my whole experience is based on how things are usually done here, which may be different from other countries

Pregnancy was super smooth except for being hospitalized for a week at 28 weeks to prevent preterm labor because my cervix was too short/starting to dilate early (apparently hospitalization for this is pretty common here in Japan but not so much back home)

Epidurals are not common here in Japan (I live in a big city and could only find about 6 clinics that even offer them) but I chose a maternity hospital that does do them, so I could have the option as a backup if necessary. 

Current hospital policy due to coronavirus is that only 1 person (who you live with) is allowed in the hospital for the birth, and even then only right before the baby actually comes out and for about an hour afterward; no visitors allowed while staying in the hospital (at mine the typical stay is 3 - 4 nights)


Details:

Even though it was my first birth the total labor/delivery time was only about 13 hours, with most of it spent at the hospital because I woke up in the middle of the night (at 40 weeks and 3 days) to contractions at 5-minute intervals and was admitted as soon as I got there. I had assumed that contractions would start out slowly and I would have plenty of notice/spend a lot of time laboring at home with my husband’s support before having to go to the hospital, but this was not the case at all. 

Going through labor by myself in the hospital was not as awful as I thought it would be - obviously I wish my husband could have been there and I expected that I would want to keep him on video call the whole time, but actually I was able to kind of doze during the first few hours and afterwards I was so focused during the contractions that I didn’t really think about whether or not anybody else was there (there was a nurse/midwife with me most of the time once things got more intense). 

A few hours after I was admitted, the nurse/midwife suggested taking a warm bath, which felt amazing and definitely made the contractions easier to bear, but they got stronger and faster after I got out which was both good and bad (more painful, but sped up the overall process)

Contractions were painful but not as much as I imagined (I’m not really sure what I was expecting). Things that worked for pain management during contractions: concentrating on my breathing, heat packs on my lower back, distracting myself with other pain i.e. scratching myself along the arm, mentally telling myself that everything was going to be fine and I would soon be fully dilated. 

At one point I did consider getting an epidural just because I wondered if it was really necessary for me to struggle without one, so I asked the midwife to check my progress. She told me I was probably already at the peak level of pain and about 8-9 cm dilated, and had me try pushing a couple of times. After that she said I seemed to be pushing efficiently so I could go ahead and push even though I wasn’t fully dilated, with an estimated 2 more hours to go. Resisting the urge to push was harder than pushing (which actually felt good/almost therapeutic in a way, concentrating on doing 2 - 3 pushes made the contractions feel like they ended faster), so I decided that if this was the max level of pain and I was allowed to push, then I didn’t need an epidural, especially since it would be a while before the anaesthesiologist could arrive anyway (it was a national holiday so they would have to be called in)

My water didn’t break until right before the baby was crowning (and I didn’t even notice it at that point) - I didn’t realize it could happen so late, but apparently my amniotic sac was very durable. Before it broke it was actually bulging out of my vagina (the midwife guided my hand to touch it and it felt like a weird warm balloon) and the midwife said she could see the baby’s head with its hair waving around in the amniotic fluid (what)

Shortly after that my husband was allowed to come into the delivery room, which gave me a big mental boost. I was especially glad he was there when the doctor came in and told me that it could all be over very soon if I got an episiotomy (even though I specifically mentioned that I didn’t want one in my birth preferences). I felt like the doctor was almost trying to pressure me into getting one, but my husband reminded me that I had said I didn’t want one and also encouraged me to keep going, which I really appreciated. In the end it only took about another 30 minutes until the baby was born and I did have a small vaginal tear, but it was shallow and healed faster than the deeper incision of an episiotomy would have. 

When the baby was finally born I felt a huge gush of warmth/release/relief, but actually I don’t recall feeling the placenta coming out at all (I did feel the prick of the needles for local anaesthesia for stitches, despite all I’d read about new moms being too absorbed in the baby to notice)

I didn’t cry when they first gave the baby to me, but I almost did when I saw my husband holding him for the first time. Even though my husband wasn’t allowed in during labor, I am very grateful that he was able to be there for the actual birth and the first hour or so afterward


And that’s the gist of my birth experience! It’s been almost exactly a month since then and our whole family is doing well - I feel basically back to normal physically despite not having gotten a full night’s sleep since the birth, the baby is growing noticeably bigger and plumper, and my husband just cannot get enough baby cuddles. I’m sure there are many challenges in store in the future, but for now we are just enjoying the moments as they come! ",352,30,2020-12-21,late delivery

BabyBumps,Pro tip to expecting mama's- tell your Dr everything going on even if you don't think it's relevant (Birth story-positive),"So this is a little late. My daughter is 2.5 months old now, but better late then never I guess lol. 

For the most part I was blessed with a fairly easy pregnancy. The worst I dealt with was hip issues, and the baby making her home in my ribs. 

So I went to my 37 week appointment on Monday. Everything was going well. For whatever reason I decided to tell my doctor that I was itching a bit. I didn't think anything of it.. My husband and i took a walk the last 2 days (we live in a wooded area + spring time so I assumed it was allergies). I told my doctor the last 2 days I've been itching pretty bad especially at night. It got to the point i actually cut myself where my belly button ring would be from itching so much. Plus my feet and hands looked a little raw from itching (I was basically scratching everywhere but stomach, hands, and feet were the worst). My doctor assumed it was allergies as well since I've been complaining about them getting worse with the pregnancy and spring time. I did take allergy medicine and it helped a bit. For shits and giggles, she drew blood to double check a few things. She said it could be Intrahepatic cholestasis, but she doubt it since it's more rare then other common issues. She called me later that evening and said to come to labor and delivery. My kidney levels were pretty low (I think- either high or low I honestly can't remember lol. Just abnormal). So she thought it could be pre-eclampsia. Even though my blood pressure has been good throughout the pregnancy, I've been having blurry vision (probably need new glasses), headaches (nothing new) and a little swelling. I also have been having contractions (BH & regular ones) pretty often for the last 2 weeks and kept feeling like I was about to have my period. Of course my husband and i panicked and it was completely downpouring. We rushed and got our stuff together and drove an hour away to the hospital. They hooked me up to everything and wanted to monitor my blood pressure. I told her I had kidney level issues like 10+ years ago. I was monitored for quite a few hours and no changes. Baby looked good. They sent me home and my Dr was going to talk to a specialist Tuesday or Wednesday to see what to do. Tuesday I basically rested all day and talked to a neighbor about watching the animals just in case. Wednesday morning rolls around and we get a call from the Dr. Low and behold the rare thing that we thought i probably didn't have, I had. I was heading back to the hospital in a few hours for induction. I got everything set up with the neighbors. Bless my husband's heart, he thought we were going to be home the next day 😂. I got the wonderful test for Covid and tested negative so off to induction we go. I was not dilated at all and 50% effaced. This was going to be a long wait. They started pitocin (i think) through my IV to get everything going. We waited and waited. 10 hours later, i finally hit 1 Cm. They upped the dosage throughout the day. I was having contractions, but they weren't as strong as I expected. At 15 hours, they tell me they can try the balloon method and asked if i wanted an epidural. I decided yes on the epidural because honestly the balloon going in and feeling it sounded terrifying to me. All that was said and done. They kept checking on me every few hours.. nothing. I think around 30 hours, i was finally 2-2.5 cm. It was enough to pull the balloon through to make it 3 cm. They gave me more meds to get the ball rolling. My water never broke. By 36 hours, I'm exhausted and starving (eating and drinking liquids, but that doesn't do much after a while.) I was still only 3cm. They checked me and realized the baby shifted a little at some point so she was at a angle and wasn't on my cervix anymore (AKA why i was also having such a hard time dilating). This child did not want to come out lol. They said they could try to break my water and see if anything changes naturally. Another doctor came in and took a look and was the first honest one.. she said she doesn't think I'm going to be able to deliver vaginally because of my size and making no progress (I'm small so I assumed this entire pregnancy I wasn't going to be able to). By 40 hours, still no progress. They gave me the option for a C section. I discussed it with my husband and i took it because I was so freaking tired and hungry and over wearing the mask. They got me all set up and i had a c section. Healthy baby girl 6 lbs 14 ounces 20 inches long at 37 + 4 days (Saturday). I basically slept the entire c section 😂 but my husband saw everything and told me about it later. Recovery was rough especially since I was bed bound for around 30 hours and they were giving me fluids. I swelled up everywhere so bad. That didn't go down for almost 2 weeks. I lived for that meal after. I ate mine and my husband's meal lol. Other than that, it went fairly well for the rest of the visit. I was finally able to go home a few days later. 

Sorry y'all, I didn't expect it to be that long. 
TL:DR - had my 37 week appt, talked about itching, got blood work done, ending up having Intrahepatic cholestasis and for immediately induced. Ended up having a C section.",201,42,2020-07-19,late delivery
BabyBumps,"Hello, Eleanor! Home birth with licensed nurse midwife. 6/21/20","To be honest, I was a little hesitant to post anything since I've heard some...pretty negative commentary about home birthing.  Upon further thought, I thought it might be good to add my perspective to the discussion.  

A bit of background: I live in rural USA. In my city there is a hospital, but they closed down the labor and delivery department for \~\*\~REASONS\~\*\~ (they say it wasn't financially sustainable but... it's the only hospital for people within a 100 mile radius to every direction except south so I call BS...but I digress...). The next nearest hospital is 30-45ish minutes away . I delivered my first two children there, but last time I almost didn't make it to the hospital before giving birth because I had a precipitous labor. YAY. I am normally 100% ""give me all the drugs"", but after not having an epidural last time and facing the fact that I PROBABLY would not be able to get one this time anyway...options opened up. 

After much thought and discussions with the doctors and midwifes associated with the practice I go to for general medical care, DH and I decided to go the home delivery route. Due to my history of no complications besides the precipitous labor, we thought it was better than trying to make it to the hospital in the town over. My midwife is fully licensed in our state, and honestly has a very impressive resume. Both doctors and pediatricians in town have high opinions of her, so we thought she was an excellent choice. From the get-go she was very clear that if she felt something was going wrong, to the hospital I would go. ALL OF THIS TO SAY- this is not a decision we made lightly. 

Now to the birth story: I was 38+3 when I started having time-able BH contractions. They were not painful but were pretty annoying to be honest. I had intended to work that day (Friday, my last day before leave) but called it in because...no. Spent most of the day putzing about the house timing contractions when they came up, only to have them get further apart or stop altogether.  That night they were pretty consistent and I was starting to get some blood in my discharge, so the midwife camped out behind my house overnight (BLESS HER) since she lives in the town over (40 mins away).  Nothing happened. 

Saturday: nothing happened. 

Saturday night/Sunday morning: I went to sleep on the futon watching one of my favorite shows (The White Queen). My husband was silly and stayed up late, and had just gone up to bed a half hour before I woke up to a REALLY BIG contraction and a rubber band sound coming from INSIDE MY BODY. I waited for the contraction to pass and I thought ""I THINK my water just broke"". So I went upstairs to tell my husband. I felt leakage and thought ""I don't think I'm peeing..."" and then as soon as I got on the phone with the midwife I got the gush feeling that confirmed my water just broke. She had stored everything at my house so all she had to do was hop in the car (THANK GOODNESS). 

While waiting for the midwife I decided that I would get in the bath. Due to COVID, my midwife was not doing water births so I figured this was as much as I was going to get. The bath REALLY helped me control pain during the contractions- which were getting to about 3-5 minutes apart. Half an hour later I got out. The contractions REALLY started going and I basically crawled to my, thankfully pre-prepared, bed. My poor sleep deprived husband applied counter pressure during my contractions- WHICH REALLY HELPS BY THE WAY. I then crawled into the fetal position because I felt like dying, and just then the midwife's assistant came in followed shortly by the midwife. 

Once the midwife got there, she tried her best to check me out. My body just...wouldn't let me move. I knew I needed to move to let her get the baby's heart-rate but my body NOPED, so she really had to maneuver to get that tracked. Pretty much right after that, it was go time. I started into pushing and made the weirdest sounds I've ever made- I'd compare it to a deep ""moo""ing. New to me, in spite of having two children previously. I was very proud of myself for only dropping the F-bomb once- and it was when the midwife was NOT at my house so GO ME (see previous birth story for reference). 

Then basically one and half more pushes and Eleanor was out! She was a perfect 6lb 6oz baby. 19.5 inches long. Recovery has been great, though I do miss being able to hand baby off to the nurses for the night...

Anyway. Home birth is not for everyone, and I take issue with it being held up as this unrealistic standard of either ""you're a shitty mom for putting your child at risk"" or ""you're a real mom ONLY IF YOU HOME BIRTH"".  Having had almost all types of birth... I got a healthy baby and healthy body at the end, so I'm good. I'm happy to answer any questions if anyone has any.

PregnancyUK,A POSITIVE BIRTH STORY DURING THE PANDEMIC,"Here goes my first reddit post...

I was pregnant and due to give birth in the midst of the global pandemic. Everything was uncertain and highly stressful. Appointments were cancelled and the prospect of giving birth on my own was slowly becoming a potential reality. Despite all of this, I was determined to have a positive birth experience.

I am sharing my story in order to spread positivity around childbirth and hopefully encourage other women who may be feeling nervous about labour and birth. 

It was no doubt an extremely challenging and perplexing experience but also magnificent and transformational. I am definitely not the same woman I was before I gave birth. 

Let me share our story… 

It was a warm sunny day on the 10th June and I had come home after a long walk with my husband; I was one week “overdue”, feeling heavy and keen to get the show on the road. The week that followed my due date were the most bizarre days of my life. It felt like my whole world stopped. Every night I would go to bed anticipating labour but instead I would wake up to even more messages which read “have you popped yet?”, “do we have a baby?”. In the end I sent a blanket message kindly telling everyone to give us some space and that the baby will come when the baby is ready. I needed to tell myself this too as I was becoming impatient - searching ‘how to induce labour naturally’ all day. Strange that one can patiently wait for 9 months but becomes frantic during those last days (I definitely made it to the 20th page on Google!). 

After the walk we got home and flopped ourselves on the sofa and I secretly prayed it wouldn’t happen that evening as I could feel my body aching. 

A few minutes later, I felt a wave go across my stomach. The feeling was unrecognisable. I didn’t have any Braxon Hicks during pregnancy and so had never felt this sensation before. I knew straight away that it was the start of labour. Suddenly, I felt wide awake. This was the moment we had been waiting for. I turned to my husband Tom and said - I’ve just felt something. I think it’s happening. His face beamed and being the practical one he started listing out all of the things we needed to do - check the hospital bag was packed, get the snacks and cold items from the fridge and set up the bedroom for labour. 

We were so giddy and excited. Finally, we were about to meet our baby girl. The feeling is indescribable.

I insisted that we should remain calm and carry on as normal for as long as possible. I knew early labour could last a long time so I didn’t want to peak too early and use all of my energy. We started watching a cooking program to take our minds off it and a few minutes later I felt another wave. It wasn’t painful at all but rather enjoyable, the feeling that would eventually bring our baby into this world. I decided to embrace the sensation and make friends with it as I knew it was going to get stronger as the time passed.

About an hour went by and I could no longer sit down so I leaned over the sofa and started to rock and sway, the movement really helped me go with the sensation rather than sit there helplessly. 

As the time passed and the contractions built in intensity, I decided it was time to go upstairs and get in the zone. I wanted to be in a dark quiet room. 

Tom made a little bowl of sweets for me and put them upstairs. The pain intensified and so I got in the shower and started stomping my feet and watching the water splash against my toes - this really helped distract my mind away from the pain and I loved the warm water on my body. I was also using a lot of sound to help release the tension, lots of deep ‘AAA’ sounds each time the contraction would come in. I felt so in touch with my primal self.

In the moments between contractions I would pause and breathe, collecting myself and preparing myself for the next one. I can’t remember what exactly was going through my mind at that time but all I know is that I was fully focused on the present moment. Looking back I think this really helped me because I was only focused on getting through the next contraction and I wasn't thinking too much about how long my labour was or how far I was. 

Very early on it became clear to me that although I had my husband's support, this was very much my experience on a physical level and nobody apart from myself would be able to do this. I also felt intuitively that having Tom near me counting my breathing was not right, it was too distracting. I needed to focus and find my inner strength. I didn’t even need to explain this to Tom, after 11 years together he knows me well enough to know what I need without words. He quietly made himself comfortable in bed. I took this as a sign of his belief in me.

To manage the pain, I was in the shower for a while stomping and smacking my palms against the side before getting out and leaning over the birth ball whilst rocking back and forth. I had the duvet over my head and body as I leaned over the birth ball. I remained naked so that I could easily hop back into the shower when I needed to, my naked state also helped me be vulnerable, stripped bare - the state I needed to be in to birth my child. 

The most effective tool I found to manage the pain was using sound. I always thought I’d be calm and serene and not make a sound but this honestly felt so counter intuitive. I used sound to manage the sensation and be one decibel higher than the pain. I felt so powerful and primitive. 

For me the sensation was unlike anything I have ever experienced, there is so much power and force behind each contraction and I think seeing the ‘pain’ as powerful really helped me to take charge of my labour. The pain was coming from within me, and so could never be stronger than me. 

It got to around 5 in the morning (labour started at 7pm), and I started to feel as though I wanted to give up. I remember feeling tearful and like I had used every ounce of my energy and had nothing left to give. At this time I was also feeling a powerful urge to bear down but kept resisting it as I didn’t want to have the baby at home!  

Tom then phoned triage and the receptionist asked to speak to me, as he passed the phone a contraction came in and I couldn't speak. I had to vocalise the pain. After hearing me, the midwife then advised that we come in straight away.

Tom called a black cab and I was on all fours “mooing” as we sped down to the Whittington Hospital - I just remember the cabbie saying “don’t worry darlin! We’re nearly there”. I must say at this point I was in a bit of a daze as I hadn’t slept the full night but even in this state I never left the present moment. I think this is why my memory of the day is so vivid. 

We finally got to the hospital and I limped to the reception desk and started giving them my details. The next contraction came in and the powerful urge to push returned. The midwife could hear from the sounds I was making that I was wanting to push. She then said ‘excuse me lady are you pushing?!’, to which I said ‘Yes!! I can’t help it’. She then rushed me into a room to assess me. She propped me up on the bed and after checking my cervix she looked up at the other midwife who was positioned behind my head - I could make out a surprised look in her eyes (she was masked up and so I couldn't see her full expression). “She’s fully dilated, get her to the birth centre now”. At that point I heard Tom burst into tears outside. 

I felt exhilarated as I knew that meant that the next step was pushing the baby out and we were closer to meeting our daughter. The midwife then wheeled me over to the birth centre whilst singing ‘we’re going to have a baby!’. We were so exhausted but the adrenaline and excitement was keeping us both going. 

We got into the room and I said I wanted some gas and air. After taking a few hits I started to feel really spaced out and high and started singing Bob Marley 3 little birds! Tom and the midwife were both laughing at me. At this point I didn’t have a care in the world, I think realising how far I had progressed gave me a real buzz and almost made me feel as though I had done it.

I decided then that the gas and air was more of a distraction than a help so I put it to one side and got back in the zone. I had my birth audio track on in the background and could make out the words ""you are mother, you are creator” with an OOMMM sound in the background. These words were incredibly helpful.

I was pushing for around an hour and half before the midwife asked me to change positions and move to the birth stool. I remember feeling as though I wasn’t letting go of the baby and I thought if I’m going to get this baby out I need to LET GO with my every being. It was as though I needed to open my heart and soul. So with the next contraction I truly let go with every ounce of my being. Juniper was then born. They lifted her up and into my arms. I can’t say I felt the rush of love that everyone talks about but what I did feel was a sense of wonder. I can still see her face now in my mind, with those big inquisitive eyes staring back at me. 

I think about that day time and time again. I felt so powerful, to bring new life into this world. I think the mental prep I did ahead of the due date really helped me. I speak about my birth preparation journey on my podcast which I record in my spare time as a new mum (aka when Juniper is napping) - give them a listen if you have the time! I also share personal experiences throughout my motherhood journey which is in some ways even more challenging than the birth itself.

PregnancyUK,BIRTH STORY- Maternal request c section. Positive birth with difficult postnatal stay.,"Back home after my c section yesterday with my beautiful girl next to me. 

Short version- ""maternal request"" c section at 39+2. Very positive and all went to plan. First few hours of post surgery where fine, then I started to struggle. All ended well following day at discharge.

Woke up very early as we had to be there around 7.30 and the hospital was an hour away. I hadn't slept a lot. I had a powder pre-load i had to drink at 6am, which I threw up in the carpark of the hospital.

Went into our own room in recovery which is also where you return for 2 hours post c section before going to postnatal. We were expecting to wait as part of a long list of c sections as its a bit hospital but we were the only people in that day.

Everyone came around to introduce themselves to me and we were in theatre by 8.30. She was out at 9.12. I didn't find getting the epidural bad, the local anaesthetic was not much more than a scratch.

I specially said I didn't want to know about the catheter. It freaks me out and I said ""I know you have to do it, just don't tell me"". They made a big song an dance of doing it. It was horrible. I had very bad nausea and low blood pressure during the surgery. That all disappeared as soon as she was out.

They held her up to show us. Babies are gross as fuck when they are first born. They took her and cleaned her up. It felt like she was gone ages, but in reality probably only 5 mins.

I held her in theatre but we didn't attempt to breastfeed, I wasn't comfortable. My husband broke down and cried. Plenty of skin to skin cuddles while I was being stitched up.

Tried to feed her in recovery, but she wasn't latching at all so I gave her some colostrum I had expressed and brought. She pooed on me at this point. Legs and bum where still completely dead when we all got taken to the postnatal ward. 

6 beds to a ward, and it was claustrophobic. I missed lunch but someone sorted me out a sandwich. She had a 2nd poo which my husband tried to change. He then dumped his entire bottle of water all over the bottom half of my bed, soaking it.

It took 2 midwifes to get me to my feet 3 hours after my section so they could strip the bed. I had very little sensation. I also requested they take out the catheter at this point just because I wanted it gone. She did agree and it was fine, much easier than placing it. My husband helped me to the bathroom, but I couldn't go.

Throughout the afternoon I manged to get up with my husbands help and just about managed a few wees. He had to leave by 8pm. I was still very slow moving and struggling to get up and down by then.

Which brings us to the poos. Before my husband left he had changed 8 poo nappies. We brought a pack of 24 to the hospital. By 8am when my husband came back I had just 2 left.

22 poop nappies in less than 24 hours. It broke me dealing with that overnight by myself. By the time I had changed her properly (novice here) she would already be dirty again, or would go just as I finally got back in bed. I was really struggling to get around and lift or move her.

I rung the call bell multiple times and asked for help. They took ages to come and I couldn't leave her lying in poop for that long. Some of them refused to help and said I had to get up to aid my recovery.

Pediatrician came at 2am and said it was nothing to worry about. I also had a snorer one bed over and 2 criers (one baby and one mum). I got no sleep whatsoever. It was awful.

My overnight messages to my husband got more and more frantic. I still had the most docile and calm baby. She didn't cry at all except a few cold shock whines when I changed her. She just slept and pooped all night 

Husband came back at 8am and I told him under no circumstances would I be staying another night. He agreed.

However, we still had one issue. She hadn't latched despite mine and all the midwifes best efforts. If everything aligned perfect she would take my nipple, one suck and give up. We tried temping her with the colostrum and actually syring fed her while my nipple was in her mouth. In the end it had been over 28 hours and all she had had was pre-frozen colostrum. She turned from docile to lethargic. We gave her a bottle of formula and she returned to being very chilled. She still struggled to latch to the teat.

New plan is get her on some small bottles of formula and I will continue to express colostrum until my milk comes in. Then I will pump.

Midwife agreed to discharge us about 30 hours post surgery, they were pretty kean for us to get moving as it was busy.

Car ride home was awful, very bumpy. Then the real pain set in. At the hospital I had morphine, diahydrocodine and paracetamol. This evening the pain was so bad I full on sobbed and screamed. I guess the morphine ran out. Bleeding has been very mild, less than my average period.

And I think I win the award for longest birth story?",14,11,2020-12-01,born early

PregnancyUK,Spent most of my midwife appointment in tears due to the ridiculousness of how badly pre and post-natal services are being handled.,"EDIT - From responses it seems that my issues are localised to my own county. I don't want to alarm anyone with this rant ❤️

I'm so sorry, this is way more of a rant than I wanted but jesus I needed to get it off my chest after my appointment this morning. 

My midwife, bless her, was apologetic and understanding, but couldn't offer any advice and just kept saying 'I know, it's terrible. I've got so many other ladies in the same position'.

So they're no longer doing anything with regards to 'big babies'. Whether that's a local trust thing or nationwide, I don't know. But if you have GD and your baby is soaring up the percentiles? Good luck in delivering that huge baby at full term. Narrow hips or a history of struggling to deliver a previously large child? Yeah. You'll just have to have a c-section, you won't be given an option to be induced early for a chance of a vaginal birth.

In my case.. High risk because of a major arterial bleed? An artery that has been reccomended shouldnt be under the pressure of birthing a child larger than 8lbs? WHELP. Guess we'll just have to test the waters and hope it doesn't burst during childbirth! Or I'll have a c-section. That's already very high risk because of major abdominal surgery performed in order to fix aforementioned arterial bleed. Highly advised against by multiple obgyn and surgical teams. 

Guys I am PISSED. My obstetrics team isn't getting back to me until the 28th of January.. Bang on 37 weeks. I have no birth plan, no guidance, no reassurances that they even know how to approach my birth considering the very strict rules they were given by my surgical team for my first pregnancy.


As a side note, she asked me how my physio was going. This was the first point I burst into tears because I have severe SPD and I had one appointment 24 weeks in and was diagnosed so late they couldn't do anything to improve the pain - just slow the rate it worsens. Well, my follow up appointment was cancelled and I was offered phonecalls. Haven't had a single one since. 

Oh, and they've all but shut down all the post natal midwife services because they don't have the staff. So those checkups you get in the days after you give birth? Noooope.

I just want to curl up and fucking SOB.",16,22,2020-12-31,full term birth
PregnancyUK,Previous cannabis use,"Before I found out I was pregnant, I would smoke cannabis once or twice a week, on the weekend to help with anxiety and my runaway thinking brain. I don't drink, I hate alcohol.

As soon as I found out I was pregnant, I stopped smoking and have not touched anything since (23+2).

We both work full time, I've got a professional job, we are just in the process of buying a new house and I have supportive family all around me.

My first urine test was positive and because of that my midwife told me she would have to refer me to Social Services. I haven't been told whether my other tests since were positive or not, but they wouldn't have been as I haven't touched anything, and I pee every time I have an appointment so someone would've said something by now I'm sure.

Anyway, I just wondered what would happen next? 

Will Social Services call me, or want to see me in person?

If my tests are all negative between now and baby birth, would they continue wanting to speak to me?

It feels a bit ridiculous that they only know because I told her, and I only smoked on a semi regular basis and am not addicted, and I've known parents do way worse before finding out they're pregnant... cannabis is legal for medical reasons and there is something called a CanCard out now whereby the police aren't able to take away your cannabis if you have any, so it seems very conflicting how they treat people.

PregnancyUK,A POSITIVE BIRTH STORY DURING THE PANDEMIC,"Here goes my first reddit post...

I was pregnant and due to give birth in the midst of the global pandemic. Everything was uncertain and highly stressful. Appointments were cancelled and the prospect of giving birth on my own was slowly becoming a potential reality. Despite all of this, I was determined to have a positive birth experience.

I am sharing my story in order to spread positivity around childbirth and hopefully encourage other women who may be feeling nervous about labour and birth. 

It was no doubt an extremely challenging and perplexing experience but also magnificent and transformational. I am definitely not the same woman I was before I gave birth. 

Let me share our story… 

It was a warm sunny day on the 10th June and I had come home after a long walk with my husband; I was one week “overdue”, feeling heavy and keen to get the show on the road. The week that followed my due date were the most bizarre days of my life. It felt like my whole world stopped. Every night I would go to bed anticipating labour but instead I would wake up to even more messages which read “have you popped yet?”, “do we have a baby?”. In the end I sent a blanket message kindly telling everyone to give us some space and that the baby will come when the baby is ready. I needed to tell myself this too as I was becoming impatient - searching ‘how to induce labour naturally’ all day. Strange that one can patiently wait for 9 months but becomes frantic during those last days (I definitely made it to the 20th page on Google!). 

After the walk we got home and flopped ourselves on the sofa and I secretly prayed it wouldn’t happen that evening as I could feel my body aching. 

A few minutes later, I felt a wave go across my stomach. The feeling was unrecognisable. I didn’t have any Braxon Hicks during pregnancy and so had never felt this sensation before. I knew straight away that it was the start of labour. Suddenly, I felt wide awake. This was the moment we had been waiting for. I turned to my husband Tom and said - I’ve just felt something. I think it’s happening. His face beamed and being the practical one he started listing out all of the things we needed to do - check the hospital bag was packed, get the snacks and cold items from the fridge and set up the bedroom for labour. 

We were so giddy and excited. Finally, we were about to meet our baby girl. The feeling is indescribable.

I insisted that we should remain calm and carry on as normal for as long as possible. I knew early labour could last a long time so I didn’t want to peak too early and use all of my energy. We started watching a cooking program to take our minds off it and a few minutes later I felt another wave. It wasn’t painful at all but rather enjoyable, the feeling that would eventually bring our baby into this world. I decided to embrace the sensation and make friends with it as I knew it was going to get stronger as the time passed.

About an hour went by and I could no longer sit down so I leaned over the sofa and started to rock and sway, the movement really helped me go with the sensation rather than sit there helplessly. 

As the time passed and the contractions built in intensity, I decided it was time to go upstairs and get in the zone. I wanted to be in a dark quiet room. 

Tom made a little bowl of sweets for me and put them upstairs. The pain intensified and so I got in the shower and started stomping my feet and watching the water splash against my toes - this really helped distract my mind away from the pain and I loved the warm water on my body. I was also using a lot of sound to help release the tension, lots of deep ‘AAA’ sounds each time the contraction would come in. I felt so in touch with my primal self.

In the moments between contractions I would pause and breathe, collecting myself and preparing myself for the next one. I can’t remember what exactly was going through my mind at that time but all I know is that I was fully focused on the present moment. Looking back I think this really helped me because I was only focused on getting through the next contraction and I wasn't thinking too much about how long my labour was or how far I was. 

Very early on it became clear to me that although I had my husband's support, this was very much my experience on a physical level and nobody apart from myself would be able to do this. I also felt intuitively that having Tom near me counting my breathing was not right, it was too distracting. I needed to focus and find my inner strength. I didn’t even need to explain this to Tom, after 11 years together he knows me well enough to know what I need without words. He quietly made himself comfortable in bed. I took this as a sign of his belief in me.

To manage the pain, I was in the shower for a while stomping and smacking my palms against the side before getting out and leaning over the birth ball whilst rocking back and forth. I had the duvet over my head and body as I leaned over the birth ball. I remained naked so that I could easily hop back into the shower when I needed to, my naked state also helped me be vulnerable, stripped bare - the state I needed to be in to birth my child. 

The most effective tool I found to manage the pain was using sound. I always thought I’d be calm and serene and not make a sound but this honestly felt so counter intuitive. I used sound to manage the sensation and be one decibel higher than the pain. I felt so powerful and primitive. 

For me the sensation was unlike anything I have ever experienced, there is so much power and force behind each contraction and I think seeing the ‘pain’ as powerful really helped me to take charge of my labour. The pain was coming from within me, and so could never be stronger than me. 

It got to around 5 in the morning (labour started at 7pm), and I started to feel as though I wanted to give up. I remember feeling tearful and like I had used every ounce of my energy and had nothing left to give. At this time I was also feeling a powerful urge to bear down but kept resisting it as I didn’t want to have the baby at home!  

Tom then phoned triage and the receptionist asked to speak to me, as he passed the phone a contraction came in and I couldn't speak. I had to vocalise the pain. After hearing me, the midwife then advised that we come in straight away.

Tom called a black cab and I was on all fours “mooing” as we sped down to the Whittington Hospital - I just remember the cabbie saying “don’t worry darlin! We’re nearly there”. I must say at this point I was in a bit of a daze as I hadn’t slept the full night but even in this state I never left the present moment. I think this is why my memory of the day is so vivid. 

We finally got to the hospital and I limped to the reception desk and started giving them my details. The next contraction came in and the powerful urge to push returned. The midwife could hear from the sounds I was making that I was wanting to push. She then said ‘excuse me lady are you pushing?!’, to which I said ‘Yes!! I can’t help it’. She then rushed me into a room to assess me. She propped me up on the bed and after checking my cervix she looked up at the other midwife who was positioned behind my head - I could make out a surprised look in her eyes (she was masked up and so I couldn't see her full expression). “She’s fully dilated, get her to the birth centre now”. At that point I heard Tom burst into tears outside. 

I felt exhilarated as I knew that meant that the next step was pushing the baby out and we were closer to meeting our daughter. The midwife then wheeled me over to the birth centre whilst singing ‘we’re going to have a baby!’. We were so exhausted but the adrenaline and excitement was keeping us both going. 

We got into the room and I said I wanted some gas and air. After taking a few hits I started to feel really spaced out and high and started singing Bob Marley 3 little birds! Tom and the midwife were both laughing at me. At this point I didn’t have a care in the world, I think realising how far I had progressed gave me a real buzz and almost made me feel as though I had done it.

I decided then that the gas and air was more of a distraction than a help so I put it to one side and got back in the zone. I had my birth audio track on in the background and could make out the words ""you are mother, you are creator” with an OOMMM sound in the background. These words were incredibly helpful.

I was pushing for around an hour and half before the midwife asked me to change positions and move to the birth stool. I remember feeling as though I wasn’t letting go of the baby and I thought if I’m going to get this baby out I need to LET GO with my every being. It was as though I needed to open my heart and soul. So with the next contraction I truly let go with every ounce of my being. Juniper was then born. They lifted her up and into my arms. I can’t say I felt the rush of love that everyone talks about but what I did feel was a sense of wonder. I can still see her face now in my mind, with those big inquisitive eyes staring back at me. 

I think about that day time and time again. I felt so powerful, to bring new life into this world. I think the mental prep I did ahead of the due date really helped me. I speak about my birth preparation journey on my podcast which I record in my spare time as a new mum (aka when Juniper is napping) - give them a listen if you have the time! I also share personal experiences throughout my motherhood journey which is in some ways even more challenging than the birth itself.

PregnancyUK,Any other mums going back to work with their partner taking childcare responsibilities?,"Firstly sorry for the formatting, I'm on my phone.

I'm (31) 19+2 and FTM. I've always been very aspirational and career focused since I can remember and I earn significantly more than my husband.

My husband (36) is actually going to be made redundant next year, likely around our due date. We've known since last December so this hasn't come as a surprise. He doesn't enjoy his job at all and isn't career minded. 

We've decided that I'll be taking the minimum maternity I can (it's currently 9 weeks at full pay) using annual leave to top up a little and create a phased return. My husband will be staying at home from birth/redundancy (whichever comes first) with an expectation he won't work for around a year. I'm also incredibly lucky in that I work for a very flexible company and will be working from home the majority of the time next year. 

Financially this protects us as I will have full pay maternity for the time off and then return to work full time. My partners redundancy is generous and will be enough to cover some debts and provide a monthly top-up to my wage for about a year. He will likely start to look for new roles around the 10 month mark and may return to work part time in the first instance. 

My partner is really excited to be a stay at home dad and it seems to be a great option for him. I think he also needs some emotional distance from work so he can figure out what he wants to do next. I'm under no illusion that this will be hard for myself to not fulfil that role but I'm really comfortable and happy with how our little family is shaping up and how we'll work together in a new way to manage. 

I have been feeling quite alone in this as I don't know any couple who've done something similar with the mum returning to work, but I know there's plenty out there. My company have said they've only had 1 other request for shared maternity in 4 years. 

Was just looking to see if there was anyone in this sub in a similar position and what your expectations are/any advice for planning etc?",13,12,2020-12-09,full term birth
PregnancyUK,BIRTH STORY- Maternal request c section. Positive birth with difficult postnatal stay.,"Back home after my c section yesterday with my beautiful girl next to me. 

Short version- ""maternal request"" c section at 39+2. Very positive and all went to plan. First few hours of post surgery where fine, then I started to struggle. All ended well following day at discharge.

Woke up very early as we had to be there around 7.30 and the hospital was an hour away. I hadn't slept a lot. I had a powder pre-load i had to drink at 6am, which I threw up in the carpark of the hospital.

Went into our own room in recovery which is also where you return for 2 hours post c section before going to postnatal. We were expecting to wait as part of a long list of c sections as its a bit hospital but we were the only people in that day.

Everyone came around to introduce themselves to me and we were in theatre by 8.30. She was out at 9.12. I didn't find getting the epidural bad, the local anaesthetic was not much more than a scratch.

I specially said I didn't want to know about the catheter. It freaks me out and I said ""I know you have to do it, just don't tell me"". They made a big song an dance of doing it. It was horrible. I had very bad nausea and low blood pressure during the surgery. That all disappeared as soon as she was out.

They held her up to show us. Babies are gross as fuck when they are first born. They took her and cleaned her up. It felt like she was gone ages, but in reality probably only 5 mins.

I held her in theatre but we didn't attempt to breastfeed, I wasn't comfortable. My husband broke down and cried. Plenty of skin to skin cuddles while I was being stitched up.

Tried to feed her in recovery, but she wasn't latching at all so I gave her some colostrum I had expressed and brought. She pooed on me at this point. Legs and bum where still completely dead when we all got taken to the postnatal ward. 

6 beds to a ward, and it was claustrophobic. I missed lunch but someone sorted me out a sandwich. She had a 2nd poo which my husband tried to change. He then dumped his entire bottle of water all over the bottom half of my bed, soaking it.

It took 2 midwifes to get me to my feet 3 hours after my section so they could strip the bed. I had very little sensation. I also requested they take out the catheter at this point just because I wanted it gone. She did agree and it was fine, much easier than placing it. My husband helped me to the bathroom, but I couldn't go.

Throughout the afternoon I manged to get up with my husbands help and just about managed a few wees. He had to leave by 8pm. I was still very slow moving and struggling to get up and down by then.

Which brings us to the poos. Before my husband left he had changed 8 poo nappies. We brought a pack of 24 to the hospital. By 8am when my husband came back I had just 2 left.

22 poop nappies in less than 24 hours. It broke me dealing with that overnight by myself. By the time I had changed her properly (novice here) she would already be dirty again, or would go just as I finally got back in bed. I was really struggling to get around and lift or move her.

I rung the call bell multiple times and asked for help. They took ages to come and I couldn't leave her lying in poop for that long. Some of them refused to help and said I had to get up to aid my recovery.

Pediatrician came at 2am and said it was nothing to worry about. I also had a snorer one bed over and 2 criers (one baby and one mum). I got no sleep whatsoever. It was awful.

My overnight messages to my husband got more and more frantic. I still had the most docile and calm baby. She didn't cry at all except a few cold shock whines when I changed her. She just slept and pooped all night 

Husband came back at 8am and I told him under no circumstances would I be staying another night. He agreed.

However, we still had one issue. She hadn't latched despite mine and all the midwifes best efforts. If everything aligned perfect she would take my nipple, one suck and give up. We tried temping her with the colostrum and actually syring fed her while my nipple was in her mouth. In the end it had been over 28 hours and all she had had was pre-frozen colostrum. She turned from docile to lethargic. We gave her a bottle of formula and she returned to being very chilled. She still struggled to latch to the teat.

New plan is get her on some small bottles of formula and I will continue to express colostrum until my milk comes in. Then I will pump.

Midwife agreed to discharge us about 30 hours post surgery, they were pretty kean for us to get moving as it was busy.

Car ride home was awful, very bumpy. Then the real pain set in. At the hospital I had morphine, diahydrocodine and paracetamol. This evening the pain was so bad I full on sobbed and screamed. I guess the morphine ran out. Bleeding has been very mild, less than my average period.

PregnancyUK,Waiting rooms,"Well, I arrived for my 2.45 consultant appointment; had my blood pressure taken; gave them some pee; and then sat down in the waiting room (which is FULL of women today). It's now roughly 3.45 and still waiting. 

The propaganda screen is on. 

Pick your poison, are you:

sleeping wrong?

feeding wrong?

eating wrong?

living wrong?

leaving your DIY too late?

The list is almost endless. Oh, and there's an advert about how two MEN decided that stretch marks were an unacceptable side effect of pregnancy, so they fixed it! Form an orderly queue to worship them, ladies, and to buy their expensive miracle band! And don't forget the day gel and night cream. As if it would work without those equally expensive additions!

I. Am. So. BORED!!!!!!!!!!!

Edit: I eventually found a nurse to ask & it turned out they had managed to skip my turn and put everyone else ahead of me. After being assured I was definitely next, I STILL ended up waiting till around 5pm to be seen. 

At that point, she berated me for coming in at all, instead of having a phone consultation. I tried to explain that I hadn't seen anyone since 12 weeks, so I wanted to see someone in person. Foolishly thought she might ask SOMETHING or ANYTHING about me or the baby/pregnancy so far. She did not. Asked me what kind of birth I wanted. I said preferably VBAC. She handed me a load of literature on elective c-sections and explained when the surgery would happen, if I chose to go that route.

Also! Got berated by TWO different people for not having my blue card?! I wasn't seen at 16 weeks, so I was never given a fucking blue card or polywallet!!! 

Came out totally deflated and desperately trying not to cry. And considering they found blood AND ketones in my pee sample, it seems fairly reasonable that I went down there in person?!

PregnancyUK,Anxious for appointments tomorrow,"I am 28 weeks today. Due to being a teacher I have been told to work from home from today. I get to relax and enjoy time at home full pay doing paperwork/planning etc until my maternity begins late November.

The baby is measuring large so I am concerned that:
1. I have GD.
2. The consultant may not take my request seriously. (I am not wanting a natural birth as I am scared of childbirth - always have been, I am 4ft and a fart and a size 6, my sister had a traumatic birth which has affected me and my family and in laws all support my choice of a c section and would prefer this to the natural birth.)

Just wanted to share my anxiety with someone. My husband is really supportive and is reassuring me all the time that I will be allowed the C-section but I don't believe him. It also sucks he can't come with me to advocate and step in if needed.",5,10,2020-09-22,full term birth
PregnancyUK,SMP and second job?,"I have two jobs - a full time job, and a job I do one day a week writing for a website. The one-day-a-week job will not pay me enough to qualify for statutory maternity pay (SMP).

I'm planning to take the full year off my main job and maybe 2 months off the one-day-a-week job - but I don't want to waive my rights to SMP.

Does anyone know if I can pick up the second job after the birth without losing the SMP for my main job? It's one day a week, can be done in dribs and drabs and is in the career I actually want to be in, so I'm keen to take it up again as soon as I can after the birth- I'm thinking of taking maybe two months off. The extra bit of cash is also much needed as we're going to struggle once I stop receiving anything from my full time job.

I've found a couple of websites which say that as long as you are working for both companies 15 weeks **before** the birth (which I will be), and as long as you're not claiming SMP from both (which I won't  be), then you should be fine - but there's always a lot of jargon and qualifying/disqualifying information, and I really really don't want to make a mistake.",3,7,2020-12-07,full term birth
PregnancyUK,"NHS birth story, vaginal birth with a drip induction","Reading some peoples birth stories where it didn't quite go to plan helped me when I was pregnant so I thought I d share mine a little late, it's still a bit traumatic for me but maybe this will help other mums
It's a long and not so pleasant story but we re both recovering well now. 

Labour started with irregular contractions on Monday the 2nd of November and I rang the birth centre to be told to wait until they were more regular, eventually went in and I was struggling with the pain to be told I was only 1cm. They checked my blood pressure and it was a bit high but got it down so was allowed to go home.

Got to 4.30 am on Wednesday and my front waters had gone so off we went to the birth centre and I wasn't much further along but my blood pressure was too high, so I had 3 hours on the maternity ward alone to monitor me and baby before my husband was allowed to visit. 
The plan was then I d get induced by pessary  if I got to 24 hours without much progression. Problem was the delivery suite was dangerously busy so those 24 hours came and went with no pessary and all this time I was on and off the monitors so couldn't leave my bed much.
I eventually insisted on being checked in the early hours of Friday morning to be told I was 3cm and wouldn't get a pessary after all and was on the top of the list to go to delivery suite, it got to 4pm and finally got to go to delivery suite.
The midwife then broke my hind waters which still hadn't gone but I hadn't progressed much from that so they gave me an hour and then I got put on the drip which meant staying on the bed got monitoring.
 I then had gas and air and dont remember much of the next 6 hours until there were 3 midwifes and my husband coaching me to push, 75 minutes later after a tear and an episeotomy baby Jack was born at 11:05pm and was 9lb 15oz. 

Unfortunately his breathing wasn't great and turns out he had sepsis so he got taken to nicu quickly after a quick bottle whilst I got stiched up. After antibiotics and a short stint with an NG tube, you would never know what happened and he came to the ward with me after 3 nights. 
And then I ended up with sepsis myself so had to be isolated for a few hours whilst they rushed my covid test to be sure it wasn't that and also have an iron deficiency so have two infusions for that on top of the strong antibiotics.

It wasnt the experience we wanted at all and it was clear the staff were very overworked so a few things didn't go as they should but after some time processing it I m grateful that we re both alive and for the midwifes talking me down when I was in tears alone threatening to leave the hospital.",16,3,2020-11-19,late delivery

Of note, I did give birth to a healthy baby at 39 weeks in April of this year. For the past 2 years I have been experiencing episodes of severe abdominal pain that come on suddenly and last for 2-5 days. The pain is burning, cramping, and seems to come in waves. No real association with constipation vs diarrhea although once the pain starts I tend to not pass much stool until it has resolved. I brushed this off for a while because it was happening only every 2-3 months and I know how difficult it can be to get to the bottom of GI issues . Only had one flare up during my entire pregnancy but it set off preterm contractions which thankfully did not progress to labor. 

&nbsp;

About 6 weeks after birth, I developed the pain again. This time, it seemed much worse than before and was radiating into my right flank and back. I went to my PCP who diagnosed me with a UTI and said it was likely Pyelo because of the flank and back pain. No hematuria so he felt a kidney stone was unlikely. The pain did not subside until 3 full days after the antibiotics were prescribed. Exactly one month later, I experienced an identical flare up. At this point, I’m desperate for some sort of work up so I presented to the ER. Basic labs (CBC, BMP, as well as Lipase) were drawn and all were unremarkable. I had an ultrasound of my kidneys, gallbladder, and pelvis and everything was normal. My pain continued so I went back to my PCP who drew CRP, ESR, and CMP. My ESR was elevated at 89 and CRP was 66. I was referred to GI and at my consultation the doctor suggested this could be Familial Mediterranean Fever which does seem to line up VERY closely with my symptoms although I do not believe I have any Mediterranean ancestors. I am awaiting the genetic test still. I underwent a colonoscopy and EGD and was honestly expecting a Crohn’s diagnosis or some indication of inflammation given how high my CRP/ESR were but I was told everything looked normal. Is there anything else I should be pushing for? This pain is absolutely debilitating once it comes on and I have no warning or way to stop it once it begins. I’ve been modifying my diet but it doesn’t seem to be related to food. I am desperate for an answer as I can’t just shut my life down for 5 days every 1-2 months while I lay in bed in excruciating pain.

Edited to add: my birth was an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Some tearing that was repaired and entirely healed by my 6 week check up.",2,1,2020-08-08,preterm birth

My doctors notes several ‘severe oddities’ for someone my age in my workup;

At 5 I was diagnosed with bilateral cataracts assumed congenital, no family history of this. 

At 14 I had a kidney stone

At 18 I had severe thinning of hair in the traditional horseshoe pattern. NOTE that while my paternal family does have MPB in the family it comes on usually late 30’s early 40’s. My mother’s side ALL the men including her father,  but one kept their hair their whole lives and the one has only a tiny amount of thinning. This was me at 20; https://imgur.com/a/sxyDcR9

I have ‘cherry angiomas’ on my scalp, something common in elderly but rare in young people even morseo on the scalp

I have macrocephaly meaning top 2% head size 

I take excellent care of my teeth and my dentist always compliments me by saying how clean they are but also says that they look like teeth they look that are as worn as they would expect in a 40 year old not early 20’s. He also said I have gum recession despite great dental care. 

Look I know all of these things can happen as isolated traits even the cataracts, I also know we all have oddities that are ‘rare’ in statistics somewhere but this seems like A-LOT of really off things with no family history. The genetics doc seemed to think because I’m otherwise healthy and active etc without issues there’s unlikely to be anything but my doctor didn’t seem happy with that. I guess any input is appreciated. I’m not expecting a diagnoses but this seems like a lot of coincidental occurrences doesn’t it?

EDIT: through insurance and work I get yearly blood CBC and metabolic tests. Always normal or close to it. 
I have seen an endocrinologist and I do have a tiny cyst on my thyroid but I understand that’s very common and otherwise have completely normal thyroid functioning. So healthy there. 

I have also seen neurology and dermatology as well as had an echo and Holter monitor (not due to issues just investigation) and all was normal. Every doc has pretty much said I show no signs of any health concerns. 

Only oddity in blood is low B12 

A BIG NOTE my cataracts were lamellar subtype, meaning that they are either caused by trauma or infection at birth or genetics however my type of cataracts are definitively different and easily told apart from the standard age related cataracts, meaning that them being related to an aging disorder is pretty much ruled out.

Here is the down and dirty.  Female, 35 years old, 5'5"", 116 lbs after last paracentesis, fluid is accumulating in her abdomen and we don't know where it is coming from.  She has had a 5 paracenteses performed with the most recent one being today where they removed 2.2 liters of fluid.  The others have ranged anywhere from 800 milliliters up to 4 liters.  She is currently taking 200 mg progestin with the idea of the cause possibly being endometriosis.  She has been taking it for about 3 months and it doesn't seem to be helping.  Blood has been tested...no cancer markers, nothing wrong with the liver, hormones seem to be fine.  We have been dealing with this for roughly 4-5 years and trying to find an answer with no help from any doctor we have talked to.

A little more background...born premature and had necrotizing enterocolitis a few weeks after birth resulting in a bowl perforation and some portion of the colon removed to fix it.  Everything seemed fine until roughly 2011 where she went in for a laparoscopy to see if she had endometriosis and see if they could see anything that might be causing fluid accumulation (this was around the time they first noticed the fluid in smaller amounts).  Long story short, they botched the laparoscopy...couldn't get in with the camera and injured her bowls which resulted in peritonitis.  2013 they took a sample of the fluid and claimed it was just normal cell fluid.  Fast forward to 2017, we start to see an extended abdomen and large amounts of fluid retention.  First paracentesis is in 2018 and they removed roughly 1 liter.  Next one is a year and half years later and they removed 4 liters. Four months later they removed 900 mililiters and five months later (the one today) was 2.2 liters. (Forgive me if my timeline is off but its pretty close). 

The fluid is a dark brown/reddish color.  It's not thick or turbid.  (think a browner tinted red wine).  Anyway, we have seen OB, GYN, Liver specialists/Hepatologists, General Surgeons, Cardiologists, General Practitioners,  Oncologists (even ovarian cancer specialists)...the list goes on in both Germany and the United States.

We have no idea what is causing this fluid to build up and it is starting to wear down all aspects of our lives.  She is in pain with no energy.  Doctors can't figure it out and with the amount of internal scarring in her abdomen, they aren't comfortable doing any surgery to find out (neither is she or I for that matter).  Ultimately, we are just hoping that someone might have seen or heard of a case like this and would have some information to offer since we can't seem to make any headway with it.

Also, I would like to apologize for the long post and I will be available to answer any other questions you might have.  Feel free to private message me or just drop a comment.  Thank you all for your time",5,14,2020-06-12,premature birth
AskDocs,Dear god help - need to divorce but husband is having delusions and won't get help.,"This not an emergency. Everyone is physically safe.

My husband has been having elaborate delusions for about 4 weeks now. I have done everything I can think of to get him to get medical intervention and it did not work. He has walked out of 2 hospitals and ended up in the ER with 200/120 blood pressure from panicking at the last one. 

He thinks he is having PTSD and flashbacks and that no medication or doctor is safe or good. He thinks I am having repressed memories because I don't ""remember"" the delusions really happened.

He is not dangerous to himself or others, so I have no recourse to admit him involuntarily or call the police. He is also a very medically complicated person so he could easily be hurt or killed if handled by a cop or doctor in an involuntary situation. 

He feeds and bathes himself, but he thinks about his delusions 24/7. He gives me 2-3 hour lectures about them, some are really fucked up, and they're all bonkers. The really bad part is that he and I were spiralling towards a divorce before this happened and now his filter is totally off whenever he doesn't smoke cigarettes (is trying to quit) and his opinion of me is mixed in with delusions now too. So he will give me lectures on how horrible I am which are completely heartbreaking and soul crushing. I can't live like this. 

He has has also demonized everyone we know including my family so I have 0 people who would be safe to invite over to help. 

He had psychosis symptoms for maybe 4 days but then they went away and now it's just delusions and agitation.

He has absolutely 0 friends and 0 family. He is disabled and cannot work. He has NOTHING outside of me. I don't have the money to support him living somewhere else and I dont think it's safe to turn a delusional person out anyway. He would refuse any inpatient situation or care center. 

I am at a complete loss for what to do. Complete loss. 

Here's the stats. Male, 34, caucasian, 220lbs. Takes medical cannabis vape and CBD daily (he is almost out, it puts him in a bad mood but wondering if it will improve delusions).Takes supplements off and on, I can never keep track of what exactly. Tylenol daily. Chronic pain patient. Adult Leigh's disease, very rare. Neurodegenerative. Tumor in his spine, CRPS, inverted epiglottis, barrett's esophagus, his muscles are stiff and hard to move in his face and neck, extreme pain in body and all extremities. Severe emotionally abusive childhood, premature birth, one small testicle. Cant take NSAI#s or SSRIs, no history of prescription drug abuse. Abused alcohol for a few years about 5 years ago but has been dry since. Was a regular drinker before that. Very sporadic hard drugs, LSD a few times several years ago months apart. MDMA once. Took a lot of DXM for pain management off label (got high) and had to quit because its fucking horrible for you. Maybe a couple years of that a couple years ago. Did cocaine once 10 years ago. Mushrooms just a few times through his life but not about a decade. Didnt start any of this until 18. His mother abused him with too much benadryl and cough syrup as a kid to keep him quiet. 

Oh and bonus, if he takes Prochlorperazine he almost dies. He took it once for altitude sickness. It's also an antipsychotic so now he will never take another neuroleptic.",2,8,2020-10-17,premature birth
AskDocs,Pressure in Chest and Head after taking unknown drug (20M),"I'm not sure if anyone will see this, or read through all of this as it is quite lengthy, but l've decided to post this here to see if anyone may have any insight or idea as to what has been happening to me. I have been to multiple doctors over the past six months and l haven't seemed to be able to get much of a clear answer as to what could be going on. Ever since l ingested this substance six months ago, l have felt the worst l ever have in my life.

Before l start, l want to provide a bit of background. l am a 115lb 20-year old male, with no prior history of heart issues. I was, however, born three months premature, and suffered a brain aneurysm at birth. I have Cerebral Palsy, which only affects the range of motion and strength of my legs. I also have been diagnosed with Depression and GAD. I've tried many antidepressants and anxiety medications, all to no avail. Another possibly important thing to note here is that I have vaped in the past, although it was very infrequent and l only did so occasionally when l was around someone who did.

I came across the idea of the use of psychedelics to treat anxiety and depression online, and decided to look into it. I was suprised to find out that many psychedelic drugs are apperently not directly toxic to the body, and are not addictive. Despite this, l was still aware that there are many possible negative affects associated with taking them. Still, three years ago, after a heavy amount of research, l tried LSD. It did prove to be very effective in relieving the symptoms of depression, even weeks after initally trying it when l no longer felt its effects. I felt no ill effects at any point during or after trying it, and all was well.

Everything started to go downhill six months ago, when I decided to take what l initially thought was LSD for what would have been my second time. It was a last resort for me, as l was extremely depressed at this point. It was on a small tab of blotter paper, which l took sublingually. Shortly after consuming the substance, l realized that something was horribly wrong and that LSD was definitely not what l had been given, based on the past expercience l had with it. The onset of this drug was immediate, rather than the typical 30 minutes to an hour at which point LSD begins to take effect after ingestion. While under the influence of this unknown drug, l first noticed an empty feeling in my chest and head that was very uncomfortable, followed by fluctuations in body temperature, where l was feeling extremely cold one minute and burning up/covered in sweat the next. 

I did notice slight visual halucinations that one would typically associate with LSD, but they were very mild and not as prominent as they would have been if it were LSD. My mind was also very clear while on this substance, which was unusual. On this same day, l was also vaping, which was obviously not the smartest decision either..However, l figure that it is important to note this here as well.

The following morning l awoke and realized that the strange feeling in my chest had not yet subsided, even though l was no longer under the influence of the drug. I looked in the mirror and observed that my pupils were very dialated, and they would not constrict at all in response to light. The strange feeling persisted all day, and l felt very fatigued. By the evening, l noticed that the pressure had increased in my chest, and l was becoming short of breath and very nauseated. I was convinced that l was about to have a heart attack, and went to the ER.

When l arrived, l was informed that my blood pressure was very high, and l had a fever as well. The pressure in my chest (which is not painful, only a very tight, squeezing feeling) increased any time that l exerted myself in any way. They performed an EKG, as well as a chest X-ray and a multitude of blood tests (including a Covid-19 test), which all came back indicating nothing out of the ordinary. I was also tested for LSD, as well as other conmon illicit substances in an attempt to find out what it was that l had actually taken. However, l didn't test positive for any of them, including LSD. Everything appeared to be in order. Still, the extreme tightness in my chest persisted. Once my blood pressure was regulated, I was sent home. 

The following night after getting back from the ER, l began to also experience a severe feeling of pressure in my head, mainly in the back, as well as the top of my head. It would start out as slight at first, and then quickly build up until it felt as though my head was about to combust, and subsiding quickly after that. I decided not to go back to the ER, since l had just been there the previous night and nothing had been found to be wrong. This feeling in my head was also not painful, but simply a pressure that would build up from the inside of my head. It would increase in severity and then quickly subside. Around this same time, l noticed a strong pressure behind and above my eyes, as well as a ringing in the ears that was synchronous with my heartbeat.

This was very concerning, as l had never experienced this feeling before in my life. The head pressure would come and go in waves, but all the while, the tightness in my chest, accompanied by seemingly random heart palpatations, was constantly present. This has been the case ever since that day six months ago, when this all started. I can feel it as l write this.


I noticed that while the first few weeks passed after the incident, l was unable to excert myself much at all, before the pressure in my chest and heart rate would increase so much to the point that l would need to stop what l was doing, and lay down. I spent about a week or two, mostly laying around, unable to do anything. I have more endurance now since then, but l still have difficulty in doing very simple tasks without this occuring, which was not the case before all of this started. 

The pressure in my head also remained, coming and going in waves. At night, when l would attempt to get some sleep, l found that as soon as l would drift off, l would be jolted awake as my heart would ""flutter,"" and this made it very difficult to sleep. I would feel a strange ache that would travel down my left arm as well. Additionally,  l had the inability to get a ""full"" or ""satisfying breath,"" as it seems the tightness in my chest would hinder that. This is still the case today.

I went into the ER again when the situation did not improve after another few weeks. The exact same tests were performed as before, despite me asserting that l was now experiencing severe head pressure and was concerned about this. The EKG, chest X-ray, and multiple blood tests once again indicated that there was nothing significantly wrong with my heart, and despite the fact that l complained of the head pressure, no further testing was done.

I was sent home from the ER once again with no answers as to what any of this could be. I went to another doctor who perscribed me Remeron for anxiety, as that was what they suspected the reason for all of this was. I was certainly nervous about the whole situation, but these symptoms were still present when l was not nervous at all. They have simply not subsided since they first started occuring. 


As l previously mentioned, l do have an anxiety disorder, but l had never experienced anything like this in my life due to anxiety. Despite taking the medication, none of my symptoms improved. I was on this medicine for about 4 months before my doctor tapered me off of it, after l reported no change in how l felt.

I regret having made the decision to take that drug six months ago, and it makes this all the more worrisome due to how l will never know what it was that l actually ingested. Suffice to say, l have no interest in taking any sort of body/mind-altering substance ever again. However, l have not improved since these symptoms started that day. 

I still experience constant chest and head pressure day and night, along with that same inability to take a ""full breath,"" and l am becoming more and more worried. Because of the fact that these symptoms have not gone away since this incident, my mind has gone from the possibility of developing heart disease to currently having an unruptured aneurysm due to the extreme pressure l feel in my head. 

I often suspect that perhaps the drug in combination with the vaping may have narrowed or constricted my blood vessels, as well as many other thoughts revolving around what could be wrong. I have never experienced any sort of health anxiety before, much less paid much attention to my health in general. What is perhaps mostly concerning to me is that these symptoms did not occur prior to me ingesting that substance, so it is difficult for me to believe that all of this is entirely caused by anxiety.


I am unable to really enjoy much of anything now, not because l am choosing to concentrate on my symptoms, but simply because they are there. I tried other anxiety medications within the past few months, but it was about as effective as taking a mood stabilizer to treat back pain. I have never experienced anything like this before and it is quite possibly the worst l have ever felt. I am concerned that l have ruined my life due to an irresponsible decision. 

 l wanted to thank whoever may be reading this, and l hope that someone here may be able to provide me with some sort of insight as to where l could go from here to try and resolve the situation or persue further treatment for this, or just an opinion of what these symptoms could be based on, and what could be occurring? 
Would anyone know if any issues with my heart/arteries would still be a possibility, even though the EKG results/chest x rays were normal? What does everyone think the other symptoms could indicate? I hope that this is just anxiety based of course, but l wanted to see what everyone thought. Above all, I just want to feel normal again.

I will be sure to respond to any questions or comments. Thank you very much for reading!",3,7,2020-12-02,premature birth
AskDocs,23M Severe skin problems and weird lab test results,"Hey Reddit! I'm having some skin problems that are quite nasty and annoying and for the past 8 months none of the doctor I encountered could find a solution so I am turning to you as I hope that some of you have come across this kind of problem or like searching for not-so-obvious answers. I'm sorry for the long post but I'm desperete for finding an anwswer and I want to describe my condition as well as I can.

# Some background

I'm a 23M (23 years old male), 176 cm height, 67 kg weight, I eat healthily (and I mean it - well balanced macros, lots of veggies and fruits, I'm currently trying to lower the amount of meat in my diet and get proteins in larger quantities from legumes/tofu etc., nuts and seeds and healthy oils). I excercise 3 times a week (High Intensivity Interval Trainings), sometimes go on walks and from time to time kayak/ride a bike/hike.

I barley drink alcohol, I don't smoke, don't have any addictions. I think it's safe to say that I'm living more or less healthily.

&#x200B;

However it was different when  I was a kid. I was born prematurely (in 7th month of pregnancy) I was fed with artificial milk as a newborn and since birth I was taking large amounts of antibiotics and other medications as I was constantly ill so there was literally no way to develop good microbiome in my gut. 

After few years I quickly developed lots of allergies, asthma and atopic dermatitis and I was under medical care for these conditions for as long as I can remember although right now I can't remember when was the last time I had an asthma attack so it's safe to say it's really mild.

# The symptoms

The skin problems I'm trying to get rid of dates back to few years ago when I started getting small blisters on the palms of hands. At the time I didn't care much about them because when I got a breakout a dermatologist prescribed me some steroid cream and I quickly forgot about them for longer period. 

&#x200B;

However the blisters came back last year in August and I can't get rid of them to this day. I got more of them in September and I believe they got infected back then because they started to ooze, crack and look much worse. At first I went to see a dermatologist and she prescriped me a course of prednison and some steroid cream. It healed quickly but after few days after the treatment ended the blisters, cracks and oozing came back.

It was at the time I moved to a new apartment so I started to look for the cause in it and finally I've found one in November - it was a mold on the wall. At that time my hands were looking pretty bad already as there were blisters everywhere and the skin has peeled off almost completely on the ring finger and in few spots on other fingers and the palm itself. There were also few blisters filled with yellow fluid. 

 [https://freeimage.host/i/191105-2.dwcWVj](https://freeimage.host/i/191105-2.dwcWVj) 

I thought that getting rid of the mold and putting on some steroid ointment will do the trick but boy  I  was wrong. The blisters came back in few days after I stopped using the ointment. In December I had a scheduled jaw surgery so afterwards I was put on a course of antibiotics that also helped with my hands and made them look quite ok. 

 [https://freeimage.host/i/191207-1.dwcENe](https://freeimage.host/i/191207-1.dwcENe) 

This is where the fun part begins. Few days after I stopped taking antibiotics  (it was Zinnat - cefuroxime) blisters came back and few days later oozing and cracking got even more severe than before. 2 weeks after I stopped taking the antibiotics I got a rash on my hands (up to the half of my forearm), chest, back, shoulders - small red dots everywhere and everything got even more severe.  My hands looked like they were burned, some part of the skin was yellow and in addition I got some yellow blisters (especially visible on the left palm). In the begging of January my hands looked like this:

 [https://freeimage.host/i/200110-5.dwcLJI](https://freeimage.host/i/200110-5.dwcLJI) 

I started to look for the cause ""inside of me"" that was not misdiagnosed as allergy or atopic dermatitis as two random dermatologists I saw in January tried to told me (I have had allergy and AD for most of my life so I think I know what it lookes like + antihistamines didn't seem to work on them) and I went to see the parasitologist. I did some tests and got the news: I had giardia lamblia in my gut. No other parasites were found. I was put on a course of some anti-parasitic medicine and after two weeks of the treatment I saw absolutely no improvement on my skin. Guess the parasites were not the problem but glad they're out of the picture (hopefully).

&#x200B;

In March I went to see one of the best dermatologists I know . She did some tests and quickly found *Staph. aureus* infection on my skin. I was put on a course of oral antibiotics and topical ointments (steroid + antibiotic) based on a antibiogram. It gave my a relief and cleared my skin in almost 100%.  Unsurprisingly, after I finished the treatmend the blisters, cracking and oozing came back, however not as severe as before. I was put on another course of oral antbiotic (Zinnat - cefuroxime) and got other antoibiotic creams that also helped me for the time I was using them.

&#x200B;

What surprised me, again, 2 weeks after I stopped taking this specific antibiotic I got the same rash once again that happened 2 months earlier. At that time I started using steroid ointments once again. My hands looked like this:

 [https://freeimage.host/i/200321-2.dwcQRt](https://freeimage.host/i/200321-2.dwcQRt) 

 [https://freeimage.host/i/200321-4.dwctbn](https://freeimage.host/i/200321-4.dwctbn) 

In April I read some articles online about possible explanations to this condition and I stumbled across this idea: possible *Candida* overgrowth in my gut. It was possible as during my recovery after jaw surgery I was on antibiotics and drinking only sweet, protein drinks based on milk as I was unable to chew and eat normal food. At that time I also looked for a cause in my gut microbiome so I got it tested and I found out that I don't lack any specific strain of bacteria in my gut but the general volume of the bacteria is pretty low. The test has shown as well that I have a small *Candida albicans* overgrowth in my gut (+1 point for me).  I started a microbiological treatment with specific strains of bacteria (*E. coli* and *E. faecalis*) to elevete the number of bacteria in my gut. In addition, for a month I went on a low-carb diet and started to take Nystatin daily for two weeks. It didn't heal my palms very much but some other problems (patches of red flaking skin in the shapes of a circles on my legs, neck and right foream) were cured. These were cured:

 [https://freeimage.host/i/200514-2.dwlH0l](https://freeimage.host/i/200514-2.dwlH0l) 

But my palms still looked like this:

 [https://freeimage.host/i/200514-5.dwl357](https://freeimage.host/i/200514-5.dwl357) 

In May I went to see an allergologist (one of the best in my country - in Poland). He said it has to be food allergy so he got me tested and put me on a high dose of Rupatadine - 30 mg/day for one week and then 20 mg/day. These medications didn't work at all as I saw literally 0 improvement. Moreover, when I received the food allergies test results I got a confirmation that it can't be an allergy because it said that I was allergic to wheat and I stopped eating  wheat few years ago so...yeah. 

&#x200B;

Last month I've seen a dermatologist once again (the one that prescribed me with two courses of antibiotics before), she gave me prescriptions for some new antibiotic and steroid ointments (for two weeks: in the morning Fucidin + Triderm, in the evening Muriptox + Fucibed Lipid. After fwo weeks I was supposed to change steroid ointments to Protopic). 

I've also read some more and found someone on /r/Dyshydriosis that stated that supplementation of Quercitin (for mast cells stabilization), EPA,DHA and GLA acids (for general skin well-being) relieved similar condition. So I started taking them and I have to admit after one month **a massive improvement**. My palms don't break out that bad, they stopped being red, the blisters still appear but they are not getting infected that easy BUT I still have to use steroid ointments from time to time as they can get not so nice. 

#  Today

The reason I decided to post here is that I decided to take a blood test a week ago. When I got the results they pointed that something bad is happening to my immunological system because it is going crazy. I strongly believe that these blood test may hold an answer to what's going on with my skin because for the past year all I felt is that my body is in some kind of ""overdrive"" and reacts to everything by ""panicking"" and attacking everything with immunological response. Knowing all the background (I told ya it would be a long post), could you point me in a right direction to find the problem behind my condition? (The test results are in Polish but I can get them translated in no time if you wish).

AskDocs,Shallow chest? Palpitations.,"Please help me. I'm so tired of waking up and feeling like this everyday.


I'm a 22 year old female. 26 weeks premature with coronal synostosis that was treated, I take trazadone 150mg for sleep , gabapentin for anxiety 100mg daily, 7mg mirtazapine for appetite and depression, junel birth control, smoke Marijuana for appetite, focus and social anxiety.  

I have been avoiding caffeine, haven't had coffee and my energy drink is undesirable because I do not want to agitate this.  I do not smoke cigarettes and I haven't smoked Marijuana in a few days just to see how I'm feeling. 

Since I haven't been smoking I've been unable to really eat well, but I've been managing to consume a little every now and then but its been 3-4 days. 

Every morning I wake up with fluttering in my chest and shallow? Heavy heartbeat idk how to describe it but it's almost like electricity and a thundering heartbeat. It consists through out the day. Sometimes if im not laying down it feels worse, other times I'm not wanting to lay down because I'm anxious for it to happen again. 

I take my gabapentin , and still have these issues. I can take up to 300mgs. Nothing im calm. My mind isn't racing yet I still feel this fluttering. I never have chest pain, but one time there was a light dull pain but I don't know if its the lung or not. 

I'm fatigued and unmotivated. Sometimes going up an elevated street takes away my breath or going up 1 flight of stairs. Sometimes I'm woozy. 

I've been dealing with nausea and severe acid reflux, excessive burping and sometimes vomiting due to the acidity making me sick. Or at times I'm unable to eat because its so uncomfortable.  I take omeprazole 20mg daily and sometimes it just doesn't help. And I can press on my diaphragm sometimes and force a burp out unnaturally sometimes too. It's very upsetting and daily.

I've been having diarrhea sometimes. Its been green and runny and sometimes my tummy gets upset. 

I've taken my blood pressure (113/71). Last night it was high. My heart rate currently is 70bpm. 

Constant temperature changes. Sometimes it feels like my skin is burning then it gets really cold and im shivering but sweating or clammy. Especially in the hands and feet. My mom just told me my temperature was low with the heater on 80° and in the last hour I've complained like 20 times about my body getting hot or cold or both out of no where. I can't even lay under my blankets with the window open at 36°..this happens off and on. My hands are usually drenched in sweat but I'm cold.",1,6,2020-12-07,premature birth

My medical conditions are being evaluated by a team of physicians and specialists, so that's not what my question is about, but background info is helpful. After sudden-onset worsening dyspnea with exertion, I had an echo done on 2/26, and since then have had multiple EKGs done (5/15, 9/8, 10/2).

My ECG results were reported as normal with trivial tricuspid regurgitation only, with heart size listed as normal.

My EKGs say otherwise;5/15 clinical impression reported as

2. Can you please help me understand what these impressions mean? I am having difficulty getting them explained by physicians.
3. What are the implications of these conditions? Like, if I have atrial enlargement, what does that mean?

AskDocs,"(20F). I've been severely underweight my entire life and no doctor seems to be alarmed. 5""3, 90 lbs.","I've been to multiple doctors and no one seems to care about me or be alarmed. I'm tired of no one taking me seriously and wanting to rush out the door in quick 15 minute appointments. My primary care doctor isn't concerned because that seems to be my set point - I've weighed 80 lbs since middle school. And my psychiatrist has told me he's just plain baffled about my case. His hypothesis is that I have a malabsorption disorder of some kind, like small bowel syndrome.

No, I don't have an eating disorder. I eat 2000+ calories a day, 3 meals and two snacks.

Age: 20

Gender: Female

Ethnicity: Southeast Asian

Height: 5""3

Weight: 90 lbs

Current medications: Prozac 40mg daily, Metoprolol 25mg daily

I was born at 24 weeks gestation at a very low birth weight of only 1 pound and 8 ounces, and spent 3 months in the NICU where I experienced complications of:

-	Tension Pneumothorax due to perforating my lung while intubated in the NICU. Apparently I also accidentally pulled out my own NG tube too. Yay me! 
-	Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC).
-	Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), probably exasperated by the disseminated intravascular coagulation.
-	A colostomy, had a stoma bag for 6 months until the DIC and NEC got better and my colon could be anastomosed. Good thing I don't remember any of it.
-	Had my bowel resectioned because of the necrotizing enterocolitis. I have a massive scar above my belly button that goes from one side of my stomach to the other.
-	A hole in my heart that later closed. Thank goodness.

Currently as an adult, I still have: 

-	Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) due to 100% oxygen toxicity. I am visually impaired. Doctors tried using scaleral buckles and laser surgery on both eyes when I was born to try and save my retina from detaching but things didn't turn out well. I'm completely blind in my left eye and have 20/100 vision in my right eye. The left eye has a cataract and calcium build up but it's been stable for years and my pediatric ophthalmologist thinks there's no point in risking things and doing surgery to remove it if I can't see out of the eye anyway.
-	Very minor cerebral palsy, caused by intracranial bleeding due to the DIC. I received occupational and physical therapy when I was a young child but I don't remember much of it.
-	Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). I don't experience any symptoms of it at all except for frequent nose bleeds. They're not too bad now that I'm older, but when I was in elementary school, my nose could easily bleed for 30-60 minutes or more. My record is a bloody nose in kindergarten that lasted over two hours because a stray kickball came flying out of nowhere during recess and hit me right on my nose. 
-	I have the Hemoglobin E Thalassemia Minor trait. Thanks, mom and dad.
-	Tachycardia. Resting heart rate of 110+ BPM. 

I've been trying to go see a cardiologist and a gastroenterologist, but I have Kaiser Permanente health insurance and the soonest appointment I was able to get is 2 months from now.

AskDocs,I am getting coflicting opinions from my clinic. I have some questions about determining risk factors and coronavirus,"This is about my daughter and myself. 
I (38m) am a military spouse and I use tricare. I am also a disabled vet and could use the VA, but have never enrolled in the VA health care system. My daughter is 2 and only has acess to tricare. 

We were contacted by the clinic on the base to inform us that we were high risk. This made sense because I have had a previous acute myocardial infarction and currently have hypertension. We also received a  call for my daughter, but her problems are far more extensive. She was born with an AV canal defect. She was in the hospital for a long time over this. She came home trached and vent dependent. She also came home with a GJ tube. Her list of previous and current ailments include 
- Necrotizing enterocolitis developed after birth due to bloodflow problems. She was not premature. Resolved after heart repair.
- bronchiotracheo Malaysia. Resolved with age and the tracheostomy has been removed. 
- laryngeal cleft, unresolved.
- pancreatitis- resolved after lipid treatment ceased for NEC
- She also had two serious bouts of pneumonia 

Now the confusing part. My wife has been working from home during the pandemic because of our high risk status. I have reduced my hours to stay home with the kids. I work alone so my my exposure risk is minimal. Last week her commander started requiring everyone who was not high risk nor had high risk family members to come back to work. No problem, we just contacted the clinic through the secure messaging service. The strange part is that our doctor replied that neither one of us was high risk, due to being young. This is the exact same clinic that called us out of the blue to warn us we were high risk.

 My wife was forced to start coming back. She is exposed to a large number of people daily. There is also a stigma around following CDC guidelines in the military, or at least at her base. 

My three specific questions are
- Should I enroll in and then go to the VA for a second opinion? 
- Should I cough up the money for my daughter to be seen by a private practitioner? 
- Do we seem high risk to you?",2,5,2020-07-09,premature birth
AskDocs,Desperate for relief from DAILY 6 Hr STOMACH PAIN! Unknown cause. Please help!,"I (22F) have been experiencing extreme bursts of stomach pain for the last two months. The pain presents directly in the center of my abdomen, above my belly button and below the end of my sternum. When pain occurs it lasts for specifically 4-6 hours, never less and never more. It’s hard to describe the pain precisely, but it’s a fiery ache that brings me to the floor, I usually resort to laying in the fetal position for the entire duration of pain but no position makes the pain better or worse. Sometimes I experience nausea and sometimes I don’t, my stomach does usually distended from bloating, but never usually accompanied by diarrhea. Interestingly I do find that my thinking gets foggy during these attacks, causing me to feel a bit loopy. This pain started out occurring every few days, but it now occurs daily, at completely random times. Food and drink do not worsen or help the pain! 

I started seeing a GI, and she gave me the works. I had a completely clear abdominal ultrasound which ruled out gallstones. Lots of blood work revealed that I have an unusual blood count- I have a 1% count of premature white blood cells. Tested negative for celiac disease. Just two days ago I had an EGD, biopsy results are not in yet. But we know there surprisingly is NO peptic ulcer, stomach and duodenum where completely clear. 
There was however variant mucosa present in my distal esophagus. (Link to photo below). My GI believes it is simply healed scarring from previous acid reflux. 

After all this I feel like there is no definite answer for the extreme pain. I am in dire need of some relief at this point, PLEASE!!!

AskDocs,Anxiety in the mornings.,"Hello, I'm a 22 y/o female, engaged, I don't smoke cigarettes,  I smoke Marijuana through out the day to eat and focus and feel more elevated rather than depressed sometimes. I get about 6-8 hours of sleep depending. I try to eat 1-2x a day when I can. I'm 5'4, 117 pounds, white. I take gabapentin 300mg for anxiety, 7mg of mirtazapine for depression, and Janel birth control. 

Anyway, I take trazadone 150mg  to sleep so far its the only thing that actually keeps me asleep for the whole night. I don't really dream either. When I don't take trazadone I have vivid dreams. Lately I've been sleeping early and waking up early with anxiety.  Fluttering heart, a heavy pit is in my stomach, and my breath becomes shallow or harder. It feels like I should lay down and just not move because of it. I feel it from my navel to my collarbones every morning. 

I've noticed it's more prominent when I sit up or stand rather than lay down. I'm currently laying on my side focusing on this to try and not be so anxious.  
I hate to take my gabapentin as soon as I wake up and risk being tired for a while. Because sometimes the trazadone already has me in a fog.. but I'm so anxious. 

I'm so tired of waking up anxious and sick. It takes a while for the anxiety to actually ease.. I just don't want to change my sleeping medication. I've been on it for 2-3 years now and it took so long to find something that actually made me sleep for more than 5 hours. 


Idk if any of this helps: 

I have digestive issues too. And I've been trying to understand why? I had biopsies and an endoscopy, check ups im also taking omeprazole. Sometimes if I get anxious or stressed the stomach acid gets really bad, I'm constantly burping and nauseous or feel like I may throw up. Or I actually do. Especially when im depressed or numb enough to not eat.. I'm starting to wonder how much of this is neurochemical? Or brain damage? 

I was dropped down a flight of concrete stairs and they discovered I had Coronal synostosis. They preformed the procedure to correct it and I'm not sure what damage there is now. I'm also 26 weeks premature and weighed about a pound, I spent 3 months in an incubator unable to be touched because lungs and skin were last to develop.. I know that being in a box has greatly affected me. I have a hard time with emotion, physical touch and what ever..",2,2,2020-12-04,premature birth

We live in Maryland, and the cases have been relatively manageable at a state level, but they're on the rise again. We've hardly left the house since March apart from doctor visits, and outdoor visits to grandparents after checking with his doctors.

AskDocs,Legs instantly fall asleep anytime I lay on my stomach?,"Hey guys, so this weird thing has been happening for a couple of years now & I seriously have no clue what the issue could be. My only guess is some sort of nerve problem. 
Anytime I lay down onto my stomach, my legs immediately fall asleep. It’s a pinchy, static feeling for the first few seconds then they both fall asleep. Also as of very recently (like last 2 months), sometimes when I lay flat on my back my arms will fall asleep. This has happened about 4 times. 

Just some info about me: I’m 22, female, white, 5’5, 145lbs, extremely active (I’m a circus coach & workout 6 days a week), & I’m pretty slim/muscular in size, definitely not overweight. Also no family history of anything like this. Only current medication is cy-red (birth control pill). I’ve been on the pill consistently for 10 years now. I’ve been formally diagnosed with anxiety, IBS, restless leg syndrome, & PACs (premature atrial contractions). I don’t smoke, drink, or do any other sorts of drugs.

Doesn't drink, no drugs. 

&#x200B;

My transgender partner has severe social anxiety it is hard for her to leave the house. So medical care has been sparse.

&#x200B;

She was born prematurely and had some hacked together nasal passages due to this, she has mentioned having plastic tubes installed in her nasal passages at birth I'm not sure how correct that is.

&#x200B;

She has had a lifelong issue with congestion, always sinus troubles. Lately 5 nights a week she sleeps maybe a couple of hours a day, spends a long time in the shower trying to decongest.

&#x200B;

She has been using, repeatedly (1 bottle a week of each) the following nose sprays: oxymetolazine and phenylephrine. This has been happening now for close to 2 years.

&#x200B;

In the last couple of months she has used sudafed pills to sleep every second night. We have also bought a humidifier for the bedroom and run AC to make sure she sleeps comfortably when she can sleep.

&#x200B;

I realize she now probably has rebound congestion from all of the nose sprays continuously, so what do we do? How do we solve this, I'm so scared she will stop being able to breathe. Some nights she fights for breath. Some mornings she wakes up suddenly unable to breathe and runs to a steaming shower to help it. Please help. We're in Australia.",1,1,2020-10-25,premature birth
AskDocs,"Metabolic myopathy - further: Jaundice at birth, extreme exercise intolerance, SVT episodes throughout life, extreme muscle soreness after a few seconds’ use, numbness and tingling in hands/forearms, idiopathic hypersomnia","I did post about this earlier but I got a reply for follow-up re: supplements & family history, and I’ve also noticed a couple things getting worse. Well, everything is getting worse. Today I had to hold the door open for a colleague, and she told me to go up the stairs ahead of her as well.... I thought I was going to pass out. By the time I got to the top of the steps, I was gasping for air. This is intolerable. I am not elderly, but I feel like I should be twice my age and a hundred pounds heavier. I can’t even be intimate with my (male) partner anymore, and it’s not at all a mental thing. My body just can’t take it.

35F. 5’4” tall. Lingering around 170-180 lbs, have lost a little weight recently, but have always struggled since my exercise tolerance is so low. I literally cannot climb a single flight of stairs without people getting concerned. This combines with muscle soreness that arises within seconds of using my hands or feet - if I’m writing, for example, a list, I have to stop after about four or five items since my hands will become so sore. This also applies when I’m walking any distance, say, down a hallway or stairs. My feet and lower legs will begin to feel very sore. I also have my hands and wrists becoming very numb and tingly, like they are “falling asleep”, any time I’m at my computer at work, or using my phone to type, like just now. I have been using wraps on my arms that my doctor gave me for carpal tunnel, but they are no longer working. 

I was born about a month premature, no biggie, but jaundiced. They put me under a grow light to get me to the right color. As a kid, I had regular bouts of supraventricular tachycardia that could last for hours. Nowadays, they still come and go, along with random palpitations. They do often seem linked to stress, and lack of sleep/food/hydration, but can also be unpredictable. As a teenager/young adult, historically I had low blood pressure (so low that I had postural hypotension), but they put me on Adderall since I had the idiopathic hypersomnia, and that seems to have raised my blood pressure to a normal range. I am also on buspirone, which is an odd thing to take at the same time, but I was on the Adderall first, then had a pretty life-shattering emotional crisis hit me, and they put me on the buspirone after that to help me recover. I have osteoporosis due to being on the birth control shot for ten years in my 20s, I currently have the implant. I’ve had one full-on surgery with total anesthesia in my life, which is when I was found to have a thyroglossal duct cyst and it was removed when I was 30. I got very sick afterwards, with nausea and vomiting when I should’ve been sleeping it odd, but otherwise made a full recovery. Other than that, I did have a septoplasty when I was 20 as well, but I was only put in “twilight” for that and it was only half an hour, so I’m not quite sure if I consider it “surgery” per se. Other than that, pretty normal, blah stuff...despite the osteoporosis, only have one confirmed broken bone, my right index finger in second grade. Wisdom teeth all removed, chicken pox as a kid, up to date on all vaccinations, including tetanus and this year’s flu, no tick bites, no cavities, I wear contacts, nothing really interesting.

As for my family, dad and paternal grandmother has/had diabetes, but the former had a godawful diet for the vast majority of his life (think fried *everything*), and the latter drank and smoked on top of the poor diet. My paternal grandfather died at 59, due to lifelong drinking and smoking - lung, liver and pancreatic cancer caught up with him. My mother is obese with a bad diet, with very bad joints and all the things that commonly go along with obesity, like GERD, but does not have diabetes. My maternal grandfather died earlier this year; he suffered blackouts and ill health towards the end of his life, but other than that, was relatively robust, dying at 96. My maternal grandmother is alive and quite well at 89. Anxiety and depression are our only other chronic issues. >_>

Really the only reason I take the D3 and Calcium, magnesium & zinc at night is so I’m not taking so many things in the morning, I guess. (Btw, I only know the abbreviations since I previously worked in a medical office.)

I’ve had bloodwork done before. The only abnormal result that ever came back was subclinical hypothyroidism, and they just re-tested it until it came back normal and then assured me everything was fine. That was in the hospital seven years ago, everything since then has normal, just your basic blood count stuff and thyroid stuff. If there’s anything else I should be asking for, I don’t know what it is.

The muscle soreness and exercise intolerance has gotten so bad recently that I just googled what it could possibly be, and outside of sports injuries (I can’t even think about doing sports) this “metabolic myopathy” came up. I know, I’m not supposed to visit Dr. Google, but I’m starting to lose hope here. It’s like all these thing coalescing into making my quality of life just bad enough into making it intolerable. I can’t lose weight because the exercise hurts too bad. I can’t walk briskly from one end of my living space to another without gasping for breath and soaking my clothes with sweat and getting dizzy. I can’t write a note on a Post-It note for a boss at work that takes less than ten minutes because I keep having to take breaks. Even typing this up on my phone is making my hands hurt. I don’t know what “metabolic myopathy” is, but it does seem to contain a lot of my symptoms. I did consider that this could just be a potassium deficiency, but, well, eating all the bananas, dried apricots, and spinach in the world (*so....many....bananas*) hasn’t changed anything. This is really impacted my life negatively. You can see I’m really wordy...this has taken forever to type out.

Anyway. My anxiety is giving me a 127BPM for a while now. Very nervous for no reason? I'm comfortable with my boyfriend. 

Also I smoke weed to get an appetite for my eating disordered stuff.. I really dont want to relapse.. relapse like not being able to eat because I'm sick. My eating disordered brain used to LOVE wanting to be sick to lose weight and its driving me crazy because I'm so hungry and it's like torture. because I've kinda been EATINGnormal lately.. and feeling good but I'm losing weight too. Or hopefully maintaining what I am at if I get help with my hernia. . I also think my before disordered habits have influenced a lot of the damage on my digestive  tract.. also the steroids and my diet I love savory food when I do eat but I've also chosen to eat healthy things like some tuna or yogurt here and here with water sometimes a coffee at work(only like 20 hours a week so 3 times a week) I stopped so coffee like 2 times maybe 1 time a month. No more energy drinks that what's a kid thing. Lots of purified water. I've been living with my boyfriend so his household and my budget are making me eat wiser. But I love spicy food when I can handle that and that is also occasional now.. and it's sad, this is really interfering with my life. 

I take trazadone(150mg),  currently out of gabapentin(300mg) for my anxiety and agitation. I've been off of my abilify(2mg) escitalopram (20mg) depression and for a couple months I havent been able to keep up , it's kinda hard i something just dont want to be sick though my body cant handle feeling that way while all of this is going on. I have a lot of emotional and mental trauma. 

I was premature at birth. 26weeks. About a pound. I (UNM HOSPITAL , ABQ NM) They intubated a few times while I was young possubly a few times were done wrong and really rough on a small child with under developed lungs.. this is also why were concerned about my hernia and possibly even suing.. but it may be too late? . I was also on steroids for growth, because my lungs and skin were last to develop during my in hospital incubation period of 3 months. (I was related all of this information by family and doctors. I've had a lot of tests done but things come back fine. I think it's just my body, also my immune system is weak, always has been but strong enough to be strong ENOUGH and ignore the problems.. which is bad. But I was also in an abusive household and my pain was invalidated by my mother and siblings because my moms influence) this is deep. This is hard. My mom said I need to say all of these things to someone. Because they're not taking it serious. I need some advice and writing ALL of this down is helping me with telling my doctor during my visit. So bare with me.) 

I was on a heart monitor and breathing monitor for a while as a baby. It would go off a lot. My mom told me. Oxygen tubes bla bla bla... so much.. 

Also, this is WILD, but my family dealt with a lot of drug problems.. alcoholism for my mom.. my aunt or mom I dont remember which one.. was drunk, forgot to strap me in I was dropped down the flight of concrete stairs . This saved my life finally getting me diagnosed with Coronal Synostosis, I was treated surgically because one side was already grown together while the other was not and was causing deformity and swelling etc etc. You can read further about it.

Sometimes, I can’t breathe randomly for 10-30 seconds until dry hack up a lung. Like I legit cannot inhale even a tiny bit. 

Happens a couple times a year for like the last 15 year when I’m both awake and asleep. Like I literally can’t inhale or speak. It’s always been when I’m asleep until last xmas where I had an episode in Costco over the holidays.

Bit of health background: I was 3 months premature at birth, but the doctors gave my mom a shot to develop my lungs and they’re generally good. Twice on my life I ended up on Advair when I lived in Asia. Once due to shadows in my lungs in the Middle East and the other in China due to allergies causing a secondary chest infection because of spring pollen and pollution. 

I do have allergies, I’m actually allergic to cats and own two who sleep with me. For the past two years o wake up some mornings wheezy. But the not breathing thing has been much longer than that. 

I had a breathing test in January and I didn’t meet the threshold for improvement with Ventolin to be labeled asthmatic, though there was some quantifiable improvement in the before/after comparison. My doctor didn’t know what else to label it as other than allergies.

AskDocs,"Severe period issue, passing out, intense pain, birth control not working, would appreciate some help","24F, white, 5’10’’, 140lbs.

I have a severe feminine issue that is returning and it is scaring me, and I would really like some help.

0-2 days prior to my period, I have a session of intense pain, cold sweats, and diarrhea. I have passed out multiple times. I get so hot and sweaty that oftentimes I am sitting on the toilet and I strip down naked, and if I can manage to move I try to lay on the floor to cool down. I sweat so much that it literally falls off my body. I am in so much pain that I can only focus on the pain, and I feel like I am going to die. ~~Or that I want to die so the pain can end~~ \[edit\]. However, these sessions only last about an hour, and once I have relieved myself I feel completely better. It is always very extreme diarrhea. There is not much warning most times, as it takes about 10-20 minutes from the onset of the cramps until the pain has reached max level. This has placed me in awkward situations plenty of times.

It started when I was in high school. I never actually tracked my periods, so I do not know if they were regular (I knew that whenever I got sick, it was time for me to put tampons in my backpack). I at least know that it was roughly once a month. One interesting thing I noticed, is that strong physical exertion could make it happen up to 5 days earlier than normal. I was on the track team, and would often have to run to the restroom immediately after a race instead of cooling down. Normal practices would not set it off early, only extreme instances such as racing in a meet.

After freshman year of college (and a few unfortunate situations), I visited my third doctor about the issue and prescribed me birth control – she was not interested in a diagnosis, figuring that birth control would likely fix whatever was going on. She was right. The month after I started birth control, my “session” was half as long and half as painful, and pretty much nonexistent after that. However, after two years, my sickness started to return. I was then put on continuous birth control, which stopped it for the next three years, until now. **I have gotten sick 3 times recently, at 5 week intervals**. It is getting worse, and I don’t know what options I have to control it.

Other things of note:

* Birth control is Loestrin Fe 1/20
* My mother has IBS but has never experienced pain/poop before periods.
* I received an ultrasound almost a year ago (November) due to what was likely a decidual cast after missing two weeks of birth control due to a delivery snafu. It seemed mostly normal. Results: [https://imgur.com/a/UDFBxqu](https://imgur.com/a/UDFBxqu)
* I had atypical squamous cells  of undetermined significance in my last pap in March.
* I do not typically have cramps other than those associated with these sessions.
* However, sometimes I feel sudden pangs just shy of my belly button, which I assume to be reproductive-related.
* The pain comes in waves regardless of me pushing or not.
* I take adderall, but not prior to college. No other medications.

Thank you for any help you can provide. I am getting increasingly nervous because these incidents are debilitating as well as embarrassing. I am scheduling a appointment with a new doctor because I really need to get to the bottom of this. Thank you.",6,11,2020-08-27,early delivery

I worry she might have some serious underlying condition like early onset dementia or have serious risk of stroke, just worry its something very major and not caught early enough in time.

What should we do? should we see a specialist or run some sorts of test? Any Medical Advice would be great

No smoking, no drinking, breast feeding. No complications during pregnancy or labor. 

Hello all so I had a baby recently and my healing was going well my stitches fell and I had been feeling great. My lochia was super light and yellow like up until last night. 
I will say that I was feeling so good that I had sex earlier than I should have, about 4 weeks PP, and I am concerned I hurt myself. 
We tried having sex in the morning yesterday and I started bleeding heavily like a heavy period by night time and into the whole day Friday. I soaked through only one pad completely. There are blood clots but none are too big. The blood color is a mix of bright red and dark red. I am concerned and unsure if I should go to the hospital? Or wait and see if anything progresses. My OB is closed until Monday which I have a PP follow up appointment.

My temperature is  97.8, heart rate is currently 65bpm at rest. I can’t check my BP right now.


Thank you all for your help. I know I made a mistake having sex too early but I learned my lesson.",3,6,2020-06-27,early delivery

I am a relatively healthy (albeit underweight) 25M, and sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't really enjoy food.

TL;DR: I get hungry like everyone else but have no appetite or desire to eat food, and try to eat high-calorie foods so I don't have to eat food as often. It's caused me some distress in life and I don't know what to do about it.

I had been a picky eater as a kid, only eating a couple of different foods and refusing a lot of what my parents cooked. I was later in life diagnosed with inattentive-type ADHD and was put on some meds (Focalin I think was the name), which when I was on them I had absolutely zero appetite during the day and would basically have to force-feed myself a small meal until nighttime when the effect would wear off and I would eat a large meal to make up for it. I would often gag on foods that I would normally like when I had to force feed myself, which I suspect may have contributed to my experience with food today.

In college, I stopped taking the medication because I was sick of the side-effects of not really being able to easily eat. I would basically only eat a few things (some Mexican food, burgers, and pizza daily), and despite recognizing that being so picky is not great, didn't have great experiences when trying to branch out. At least a quarter of the time when I tried a new food I would gag on it or spit it up, and most of the time I would not enjoy the food. I never cooked and only ate out at places (often fast food) or got delivery. I did not see the value of spending extra time working to prepare something that I likely would not enjoy anyways.

Since college my habits and food tastes have largely stayed the same, and it's caused some significant distress in personal relationships, including:
 - difficulty attending events where food I don't like is provided
 - annoyance to friends when deciding what to eat
 - noted as the primary reason a SO (who self-describes as a 'foodie') decided to break up with me

I have started using marijuana (it is recreationally legal here) in the last year to artificially increase my appetite, and it does help somewhat, but I don't want to have to be high every time I want to enjoy food, I want to just enjoy it naturally.

I imagine my experience with food is analogous to how asexual people feel in some ways; food/sex is something that the vast majority of people naturally enjoy and thus most people don't know what it's like to experience life without enjoyment of it. I know I certainly don't understand what an ace's experience with sex is like.

Another detail is that whether or not I like a food is largely based on texture alone. In general, I prefer dry foods over wet foods (no milk in cereal, well done meat for less juices, raw mushrooms over cooked, no soup, etc.), and generally prefer less variety in the foods that I do eat (plain cheeseburgers, just pepperoni pizza, meat-only tacos at Taco Bell). I also almost never snack on foods and only eat when I am too hungry to focus on whatever I'm doing.

Is this something that is experienced by other people? Is it diagnosable or is there something I can do about it? I don't seem to fall into the eating disorders that I know of; I have no body image issues, I don't want to be skinnier, and I don't voluntarily regurgitate food.",3,5,2020-08-09,early delivery

* hit by a slow moving vehicle in November of 2019, submitted to ER and had emergency surgery to reconstruct her elbow. Unfortunately, she was hit on her left side and this further impaired her walking and increased her hip pain. No hip fractures occurred. She has been in a sitting / lying position with very little movement since November of 2019.
* had edema in her lower extremities on several occasions since her liver fibrosis diagnosis. Currently present for about 4 months, she attributes this to sitting a lot.
* increased foot deformity in the last few years, but not the charcot foot. She has emphasized gouts and overlapping toes, random wounds that heal slowly and infect quickly.
* has been experiencing some confusion, forgetfulness and behavioral changes (anger, depression) on and off since 2014, I noted these occurring when her alcohol intake increases.
* In absence of alcohol she displays clear withdrawal symptoms since 2008
* important to note: although she has difficulties walking more than a few meters, she recently discovered home delivery and orders alcohol when others refuse to get her some. There's no stopping her, she refuses any type of treatment / help and denies ever drinking.

I am pregnant the second time. 7 weeks, so it is still early.
Now I am concerned that I could suffer early delivery again like I did during the first time.

Background:
My first pregnancy in 2016 was with di-di twins. 
I was doing good in the beginning, no servere morning sickness, all values good.
In week 29 my gyn discovered that my cervix had shortend to 14mm (if I recall correctly) and I had early contractions.
I was admitted to the hospital immediately, put on best rest, received meds to stop the labor (tokolyse, if this is an english term at all?). I also received antibiotics as there seems to have been an infection.
Well, from week 30 on my amniotic fluid got lower and lower.There was probably a leakage in one of the sacks. 
Also, my cervix just ""vanished"" over the time. It was down to 4mm.
At 32 wks the twins were delivered via c-section.

The hospital told me I had a cervix insufficiency.


How likely is it that this will happen again this time? Was it just bad luck, or because of twins? 
Should I mentally prepare myself for long bed rest and a NICU stay?


I will obvl discuss this with my doc, but the next appointment is in 3 weeks and I am just nervous and worried.

During pregnancy was diagnosed as gestational diabetic (the most compliant diabetic you've ever seen).  She threw a nasty superior messenteric venous thrombus almost immediately after delivery which was fun and led us to the heterozygous Leiden diagnosis. She is back to her pre pregnancy weight (or darn close) at 125 lbs.

About a month ago she starts having bouts of hypoglycemia that occur late morning or early afternoon and happen almost every day.  We tried dietary changes with no results.  Contacted her ob who got her a 2 hour glucose tolerance test.  First hour was fine, second hour results: 22 followed with slurred speech and a small car accident.

We've been working for a month to get her into an endocrinologist but it's going to be at least another month so i figured I'd ask here for ideas on what this could possibly be.  Primary care is useless as he tried to start her on metformin which is contraindicated with Coumadin.

Last thing to add, I've never seen any of her finger sticks showing hyperglycemia and she's on Coumadin for the clotting disorder.  Also had two family members die of pancreatic cancer 2 generations ago (this is what I'm really scared about)

medical history- 3 pregnancies, all vaginal deliveries 


In late February/early March my entire family got really sick.
Nasty cough, fever, fatigue. My eldest child needed to go to urgent care because he had hallucinations from low oxygen, he tested negative for the flu. Every time I took a breath it felt like it was restricted. Every time I blew my nose there was a small tinge of blood. I was exhausted just walking room to room. I don't have insurance and tend to ignore medical issues as it is, I wasn't near death so I didn't seek medical help, just waited for it to pass, after a few weeks it did.
Also around this time all the skin peeled off the bottom of our toes. And my hair began falling out in handfuls. 

Now it's 6 months later and within these 6 months life has been stressful as all hell what with lockdowns and lost jobs and everything else going on. So I've been ignoring the things I've been experiencing and attributing them to the stress.

Over these 6 months I have still had bouts of extreme fatigue. My hair has not stopped falling out, every time I comb it handfuls come out. I have blatantly obvious bald spots at these point and I get sharp pains in my chest. I began to find it hard to think and remember things, and stumble over my words a lot when talking.

I have recently read that these are symptoms common in some people who have had Covid and I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do about them.
I recently began taking collagen to hopefully help with the hair loss. But will it even help if its post covid symptoms? 
How long will this last... it's been going on for half a year already?

I should have health insurance in the next month or so, is this even worth bringing up to a doctor.
Last time I took my oldest to urgent care I asked about an antibody test and the doctor agreed it sounded like we had covid, but said an antibody test wouldn't be reliable as it had been over 3 months.

He didnt sound too eager to do it (basically said if you want), and said may have lymphadema if you do decide to do it. This was during the early outbreak of covid when they were not doing elective surgeries. I have not done the biopsy yet.

For obvious reasons I am concerned this will also happen to me.

The thing is, I don’t want to go to the hospital for weeks. If my water breaks very early, it seems I should let go of hope for the life I’m carrying. 

Is this something that I may have a choice about? Or will they force me to be hospitalized?

I’m roughly 6 weeks pregnant (not confirmed as I haven’t gotten my bloodwork done yet, but I took a home test 2 weeks ago the day after my missed period). I don’t smoke, drink, or use recreational drugs. I’m diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, and I was taking 30mg of Vyvanse daily, but stopped when I found out I was pregnant. 

This is my third pregnancy. I had hyperemesis gravidarum the entire duration of my first pregnancy, but it was otherwise healthy and ended in a vaginal delivery last June. My second pregnancy was surgically terminated in January. I had a copper IUD in two months ago, but it ended up dislodging and getting stuck in my cervix. I had to have it removed in the ER. (Not sure if that’s relevant, but I don’t want to leave out any potentially important info.)

For the past 3 weeks (starting a week before I got a positive test), I’ve been having super intense cramping sensations on the lower right side of my abdomen (halfway between my bellybutton and right hipbone). At first I thought I was just about to start a rough period, but that obviously wasn’t the case. It got a bit better for a few days, but it came back today much worse than before. It especially hurts when I’m lying down on my left side or when anything touches my stomach even slightly.

  Giving all the information i have, this is about 3 years worth. The last two paragraphs are present day if you feel the need to skip forward. I do apologize for the longevity but i find that all the info tends to help.

  

  So as a recap. I have 2 herniated disks. I forget what the first one is but it doesnt actually bother me all that much and never has. However, my L5/S1 disk is also herniated and i have the sneaking suspicion that its actually pushing on my sciatic nerve root or some nerve root in the area. This is an ongoing problem that started around September/October 2017. Absolutely no idea what caused the herniation. When i first noticed it, i thought i had pulled my right hamstring muscle so i would stretch it a bit every day and it just slowly got worse and worse. Eventually I ended up at a orthopedic office and they did some nerve test (ECG i think it was called) twice. only the second time did they actually ""find"" something and then refer me to get an MRI. By this time I was struggling to stand for any length of time and sitting then standing or vice versa caused me so much pain i would be in tears. This was exacerbated by the fact that my job required me to be on my feet constantly with the only ""down"" time being when i was driving the work truck to make customer deliveries. If i didnt sit EVER, i would be sort of okay, but once i had to jump in the truck all bets were off and i couldnt hardly move the rest of the day.  I was referred to PT, and we didnt have an official diagnosis yet. PT made everything SOOOOOO much worse. The PT eventually told me to stop going and to go back to the doctor again. Thats when they did the second nerve test.  Later, MRI results came in and showed DDD as well as the two herniations and some slight scoliosis. They said they could do an injection that was basically a epidural and that could fix it. Opted for the shot, was great for about 3 days, then it came back with a vengeance. At my wits end, I tried a chiropractor. This was after about a year and a half of constant excruciating pain. The chiropractor did make things better. I wasnt 100% but i wasnt constantly in crippling pain. I did this for 10 months to a year, and in the last 2 ish months we hit a plateau and i just wasnt getting better. I stopped going. About 3 months later i woke up one morning needing to use the bathroom and thought to myself, man walking really hurts. I use the restroom and go back to bed. lay there in bed going ""ow ow ow"" and it just slowly got worse. I wake my husband up just sobbing in pain and hes doing everything from massages to ice packs and threw some tylenol at me just to make me feel better. He eventually calls my mom after what felt like hours (it was maybe 20 minutes) and asks her if she can meet him at the ER. She tells him to try Urgent care first. We drive across town to the urgent care clinic once the pain killers kick in enough that im able to stand. my entire back side following my sciatic nerve is COMPLETELY numb. I cant feel even feel myself pinching the area. its all the way down the right side of my foot encompassing my last two toes. We visit urgent care, he throws some gabapentin and tapered prednisone at me and says to visit the orthopedist again. The last time i saw the orthopedist he recommended surgery that i both couldnt afford up front and also couldnt afford to take time off of work for. The pain never comes back (although i do have some pain when on my period and my back is significantly stiffer)

  

  I forgo the orthopedist for about a year. I choose a different but highly recommended one because my right leg is still numb. During the time i also noticed if i stand too long my left thigh goes numb. never brought this up to the doctor because i didnt think it was relevant (big mistake). meet witht he surgeon after another MRI. It shows the same results, two hernations, slight scoliosis, and DDD. He doesnt recommend surgery because there is no pain and its about a 50/50 shot that he can either fix the numbness OR surgery will just make me in pain again. Thanked him for his help and we went on our way. 

  

  Well that was probably about 10 months ago. In the last month i have noticed the same pain starting in my left leg. I began noticing it when i would walk on my treadmill and after about 3 minutes of walking my ENTIRE left leg would go completely numb. I would stop, drink some water, take a seat, and the feeling would slowly come back. I would try to walk again and get the same result. About a week or two has passed and now my left leg is constantly in pain. I cant walk for more than 5 minutes without having to lean on something. My leg will go numb but have this deep throbbing pain in my buttock area right where i had the issue in my right leg. The sciatic nerve track is also numb all the way down my left leg now. 

  

  Im at a loss of what to do. Who do I need to see? What do i need to do? Im so tired of being in pain constantly. I take Ibuprofen just to be able to do my job all day long. I cant exercise on my treadmill because im in constant pain. Im gaining back all the weight i lost. Does anyone have any ideas?",1,1,2020-05-15,early delivery

Sex: Female

Height: 24.61 inches

Weight: 13.49 pounds

Diagnosed medical: NAS

Medications: None

I have had custody of my niece for the last 8 months and she is nearly 9 months old. She spent the first month of her life in the NICU because she was born with NAS; having been exposed to methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroine. From the very beginning of me having her she has very sensitive skin, she bruises far easier than my children ever had. Example: she laid her head on my mother's wrist for about ten minutes and her bracelet caused a notable bruise on her face.

As far as developmentally, my niece is advanced and hitting milestones early. She is already pulling up, babbling and saying words, etc. She is a very active baby, and her bruising has continued along with her added mobility. i have tried to baby-proof my home to the best of my ability, but I suppose I have failed miserably because her bruising still happened. I have also discussed the bruising and finding a cause t every well-child visit and every additional visit we get related to her NAS, as well.

Last Monday I woke up to find her leg twisted in her crib and she did not cry until she actually saw me. I cannot tell you exactly how it was positioned because it was a different type of cry and i panicked in trying to free her. Her leg was caught between the bumper (i know it's not supposed to be in there, but if it isn't she will continuously bang her head on the wood when she is upset at bedtime) and her leg was in between the slats of the crib. I was able to twist her leg free after maneuvering her leg a bit. It was red and she was obviously upset, but no swelling had appeared as of yet. I comforted her and got her to calm down and we headed downstairs, so I could make a bottle and breakfast.

I placed my niece in her walker, that she does not usually walk in, she just kind of bounces. I made her a bottle, put a handful of cheerios on her walker tray, and then started breakfast for myself and my four year old. She was no longer upset and I continued our usual daily routine, as I had previous times she got her leg stuck in the crib. Throughout the day I did notice that her leg that got caught was kind of causing her issues; she didn't jump on it as much, she did not use it as much during crawling, she was not trying to stand, etc. Around dinnertime I began to notice that her leg was starting to swell. I became concerned at that time, but my boyfriend was not home, so i could not immediately go to the emergency room due to covid-19 and I did not want the possibility of exposing my daughter by taking her too.

When my boyfriend got home from work, which was around ten that night. When we got to the ER they performed x-rays on her leg and they said that they could not see a fracture, but decided to splint. They would need radiology too review because she did move (she hates being held down) and they were not as clear as they would like. We were sent on our way with the splint and advised to follow up with her PCP. The next morning, I called first thing to her PCP, and had to schedule an appointment for the next day. We went to the PCP and she wasn't alarmed by the results at that time either and said we needed to follow up with an Ortho in about a week.

I missed a call from her PCP early evening that said the radiologist was able to review her x-rays and there might be some concern and that I needed to take her into Children's ER and they would retake the x-rays. So, I got her and myself ready and packed up the car to go, with my boyfriend and four year old staying home again. Just as I put on my seat belt a lady with a binder knocks at my door and my four year old opened the door. I freaked out, and hopped out of the car. Turns out she was with Child Protective Services, and interviewed us and went to the ER with my niece and myself.

The PCP had called the ER ahead to tell them I would be coming in for additional x-rays, but in looking at my niece's paperwork her admission reason was listed was ""Non-Accidental Trauma"" and this was prior to them obtaining a clear x-ray of the original issue. So, first I would like to know if this is common, to list this as a reason to admit someone into the ER without even having all of the information. I feel like it created a biased among the nurses and doctors who reviewed her papers and examined her. She was admitted for testing and observation and i was treated very poorly by staff, from being ignored, to a nurse huffing and rolling her eyes at me.

During her ER visit I was presented with her leg's x-ray and i was advised it was called a metaphyseal fracture to her growth plate, I remember this specifically because I asked the doctor to spell it and explain it. My concern was her growth and I wanted to have a full understanding of what was wrong with her. The doctor said that these types of fractures are also called bucket-handle fractures and briefly explained why. They then performed additional testing on my niece; a skeletal survey, a brain CT, and some blood work. They did find an additional fracture in her right ulna, which i was told was her wrist area. And they later found a hairline fracture on her back left side of her skull, but no injuries to her brain.

After being in the ER for close to four hours, I was told that DHS was taking custody of both my niece and my four year old and I was required too stay with my niece while she was in the hospital for observation. She was supposed to have additional testing done during her observation period to try to find an underlying explanation to her issues. I was only visited for additional blood testing. She was visited by a CSI photographer and a forensic pediatrician in addition to the regular team of doctor's and nurses.

What I need help with is in understanding her discharge paperwork, it says something completely different as far as her leg injury from what I was able to google. I feel as though I am in an uphill battle to get my babies back and I am terrified that they are giving me conflicting information all along the way and from this doctor to that doctor or nurse, information changes. I cannot afford an expert to get a second opinion from, so I am hoping you guys can help to point me in the right direction.

AskDocs,34 weeks pregnant and baby weighs 2lbs.,"My sister is 34 weeks pregnant and the baby weighed just under two lbs last week (at 33 +1).  My sis sees her two doctors (OB/GYN and MFM) twice a week.  The baby had stalled in growth for a while (I am not sure how long) around the same time that my sister was discovered to have some blood clotting disorders.  She has been on blood thinners since about week 22.  Her OBGYN told us this week that the baby will not reach 4lbs before birth (sometime in the next 6 weeks)and will stay in the NICU until she does reach 4 lbs and can eat on her own.  Her original due date was Dec. 16.  Modified due date was Dec 27.  We were told this week she will not go past Dec 20.  Sis has opted to have a c-section whenever the doctors or her body decides it is time.

I can only find info on babies born that small at 24-26 weeks.  i can't find anything about a baby being that small at this gestational age. the baby has gained 10oz in the past month.  My sister's nurse told her today that this is a miracle baby.  I don't think they ever said as much but it is starting to be clear that the doctors and nurses did not expect the baby to survive this long.

My sister is single, 22, 5'1"".  she weighed about 100lbs but now weighs 124lbs.  she did smoke, drink and do drugs (weed, cocaine, meth) previously but I don't think she has done much more than weed in the 6 months before she got pregnant.  She has always had problems with eating and nausea and now has been diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and some other blood clotting disorders that we had no idea about.  the baby has checked out normal for chromosomal and genetic abnormalities.  No amniocentesis was done. her amniotic fluid values have been between 6 and 8.  baby did have some heart issues (two stenoses and a psuedo hole) but at the most recent ultrasounds the problems seem to have resolved.

I am pregnant the second time. 7 weeks, so it is still early.
Now I am concerned that I could suffer early delivery again like I did during the first time.

Background:
My first pregnancy in 2016 was with di-di twins. 
I was doing good in the beginning, no servere morning sickness, all values good.
In week 29 my gyn discovered that my cervix had shortend to 14mm (if I recall correctly) and I had early contractions.
I was admitted to the hospital immediately, put on best rest, received meds to stop the labor (tokolyse, if this is an english term at all?). I also received antibiotics as there seems to have been an infection.
Well, from week 30 on my amniotic fluid got lower and lower.There was probably a leakage in one of the sacks. 
Also, my cervix just ""vanished"" over the time. It was down to 4mm.
At 32 wks the twins were delivered via c-section.

The hospital told me I had a cervix insufficiency.


How likely is it that this will happen again this time? Was it just bad luck, or because of twins? 
Should I mentally prepare myself for long bed rest and a NICU stay?


I will obvl discuss this with my doc, but the next appointment is in 3 weeks and I am just nervous and worried.

AskDocs,29 weeks pregnant and baby only weighs 1lb 2oz.,"My(47F) 22 year old sister is pregnant. sis was adopted so that is why we have such an age gap.  I have been her sis/mom her whole life.  Our mom died of cancer when sis was 16.

 Sis is at 29 weeks gestationor 27. her OBGYN and fetal medicine specialist do not agree on due date.  it is sometime in mid to late December. she was told today that her baby only weighs about 1lb 2oz.  sis was diagnosed with Antiphospholipid syndrome at about 23 weeks.  this is her first pregnancy.  She was given notice earlier this week that she is being taken off work by the doctors.  she has been told she will probably be hospitalized sooner or later.  Genetic testing for the baby came back with no abnormalities.

I am just trying to figure out what to expect so I can support my sister.  My sister is single and lives alone. baby daddy makes promises but has yet to keep any. I am going to try to pay her bills so she doesn't stress too much but I need to know what to expect once the baby is born.  Due to the virus and my own work schedule, I have not been able to go to the doctor with my sis and ask her doctors these questions. She does not think to ask questions while she is at the doctor because she is so stressed and worried. I am not looking for any diagnosis with this post, more of a range of possibilities.  I feel like, with the baby this small currently, that it is too much to expect the baby will be small but otherwise perfectly healthy at birth.  Can anyone give me a range of possibilities from ""no problems, enjoy the baby"" to ""prepare for the worst""?  I don't know what is in between those two extremes. I don't think my sister could handle/deal with a baby with significant disabilities.  I know that no one knows for sure until the baby is born but I need to think about things before she gets here so I can deal with it. let me see if I can break it down to questions...

1. how likely is it that she will carry to term?
2. how likely is stillbirth at this stage?
3. how likely is a NICU stay?
4. how likely are life altering disabilities for the baby? severe disabilities?
5. what are the dangers to my sis with the blood clotting issue?
6. my sis just called and said the doctor says the baby's heart walls are very thick and she is not growing and she can't go on like this.  they are having her come back on Monday.

I am open to any discussion at this point.  I just feel like I need to be prepared.  My sis is surrounded by her friends that have all had healthy babies with absolutely no problems and were able to work the whole time and she did not think about any of this when she got pregnant and chose to continue the pregnancy.  I advised her to get an abortion because my sis has some untreated mental illness and substance abuse issues that she needs to address before she has a kid. And she wasn't working.  My dad kicked her out because the only thing he asked her to do as long as she lived in his house was to not get pregnant. she made the decision to keep the baby and I made the decision to support her and the baby as much as I can.

AskDocs,Please Help Me,"Age: 8 Months

Sex: Female

Height: 24.61 inches

Weight: 13.49 pounds

Diagnosed medical: NAS

Medications: None

I have had custody of my niece for the last 8 months and she is nearly 9 months old. She spent the first month of her life in the NICU because she was born with NAS; having been exposed to methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroine. From the very beginning of me having her she has very sensitive skin, she bruises far easier than my children ever had. Example: she laid her head on my mother's wrist for about ten minutes and her bracelet caused a notable bruise on her face.

As far as developmentally, my niece is advanced and hitting milestones early. She is already pulling up, babbling and saying words, etc. She is a very active baby, and her bruising has continued along with her added mobility. i have tried to baby-proof my home to the best of my ability, but I suppose I have failed miserably because her bruising still happened. I have also discussed the bruising and finding a cause t every well-child visit and every additional visit we get related to her NAS, as well.

Last Monday I woke up to find her leg twisted in her crib and she did not cry until she actually saw me. I cannot tell you exactly how it was positioned because it was a different type of cry and i panicked in trying to free her. Her leg was caught between the bumper (i know it's not supposed to be in there, but if it isn't she will continuously bang her head on the wood when she is upset at bedtime) and her leg was in between the slats of the crib. I was able to twist her leg free after maneuvering her leg a bit. It was red and she was obviously upset, but no swelling had appeared as of yet. I comforted her and got her to calm down and we headed downstairs, so I could make a bottle and breakfast.

I placed my niece in her walker, that she does not usually walk in, she just kind of bounces. I made her a bottle, put a handful of cheerios on her walker tray, and then started breakfast for myself and my four year old. She was no longer upset and I continued our usual daily routine, as I had previous times she got her leg stuck in the crib. Throughout the day I did notice that her leg that got caught was kind of causing her issues; she didn't jump on it as much, she did not use it as much during crawling, she was not trying to stand, etc. Around dinnertime I began to notice that her leg was starting to swell. I became concerned at that time, but my boyfriend was not home, so i could not immediately go to the emergency room due to covid-19 and I did not want the possibility of exposing my daughter by taking her too.

When my boyfriend got home from work, which was around ten that night. When we got to the ER they performed x-rays on her leg and they said that they could not see a fracture, but decided to splint. They would need radiology too review because she did move (she hates being held down) and they were not as clear as they would like. We were sent on our way with the splint and advised to follow up with her PCP. The next morning, I called first thing to her PCP, and had to schedule an appointment for the next day. We went to the PCP and she wasn't alarmed by the results at that time either and said we needed to follow up with an Ortho in about a week.

I missed a call from her PCP early evening that said the radiologist was able to review her x-rays and there might be some concern and that I needed to take her into Children's ER and they would retake the x-rays. So, I got her and myself ready and packed up the car to go, with my boyfriend and four year old staying home again. Just as I put on my seat belt a lady with a binder knocks at my door and my four year old opened the door. I freaked out, and hopped out of the car.

The PCP had called the ER ahead to tell them I would be coming in for additional x-rays, but in looking at my niece's paperwork her admission reason was listed was ""Non-Accidental Trauma"" and this was prior to them obtaining a clear x-ray of the original issue. So, first I would like to know if this is common, to list this as a reason to admit someone into the ER without even having all of the information. I feel like it created a biased among the nurses and doctors who reviewed her papers and examined her.

AskDocs,I have/had an IUD pregnancy and need advice,"Update: hcg levels have dropped again to 67. I'm going back tomorrow to test again to ensure they keep falling now. Quite disappointed but guess it's not meant to be. Thank you to everyone for all your support and kind words. 



Hello, hoping someone can help put me out of my misery. My (33f) husband (46m) and I have two children and thought we were done. I have had the mirena IUD since our 2 year old was born. 

My last menstrual period was early-mid August, but a week after it ended I started spotting and have been since. Hubs and I had sex 28th August. This past Tuesday I woke with cramping that felt unusual, I thought something was wrong with my mirena but thought I would take a home pregnancy test to rule it out. Shock horror it was positive. Initially I was horrified,  thought my family was complete but have since come to believe if this ends up being viable we will be thrilled. 

Went to the hospital for bloods, hcg level was 99. Went back thursday and levels are 85. Which I think means this is unviable? I have to go back saturday for another test to see if they continue to fall. 

My question being, is this a definite miscarriage? Is a slight fall definitely a miscarriage? The spotty stopped yesterday and I feel fine otherwise. Is there a chance this could be visble or do i need to resign myself to this not happening? This is our last (surprise) shot as hubby just had a vasectomy a week ago (typical luck for us). 

Also will the iud need to be removed? 

And on the off chance this pregnancy continues, is removing the iud or leaving it in better medically?

AskDocs,HELP!!! MY 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER CANNOT WALK OR TALK,"Hello, my husband and I (both 35) have a wonderful daughter who we love so so much, but who we fear has not been properly diagnosed. She just turned two years old last month and she can neither walk nor talk. We are DESPERATE for someone to simply point us in the right direction so that we can get her an early diagnosis as we know the earlier, the better to begin therapies for improvement. Here are her symptoms:

1. She has no words. None at all. She cannot say “mama” or “dada” or any other word. She does however, know how to sign for food when she’s hungry. Lately she has been grunting a lot. Saying “ughhhhh” as a form of communication which sounds to me like she is frustrated by her inability to communicate. It’s a deep gutter all “ughhhhhh”. 
2. She cannot walk on her own. She can if an adult is holding her hand (maybe 15 steps before collapsing) but she cannot walk by herself. The doctors say there is nothing physically wrong that is preventing her from walking. 
3. She cries incessantly. She is constantly screaming and crying and seems genuinely terrified sometimes when there is too much noise stimulation around her. For example, if my husband and I sing a song  to her in unison, she will burst into tears and scream in terror. Could this be a sensory issue? 
4. Doctors insist there is nothing wrong with her ears. So hearing is okay. 
5. She is somewhat cross eyed. Her left is extremely lazy and she never appears to be looking at you, but somewhat past you. I know the obvious answer here “well if you get her glasses, she might be able to walk”, but I was blind as a bat when I was a child and walked at 10 months— also, this would not provide an explanation as to why she cannot talk. If she was talking but not walking, I’d be less concerned. 
6. She is obese. 39 pounds, which is the 99 percentile for most 3 year olds (again, she is two) Food is the only thing she seems to genuinely love and which gives her pleasure. Its hard to describe it, but when she eats food, she expresses a deep pleasure that is not normal for a toddler. It is almost orgasmic. (We have two other kids, 4 years old and 6 years old so this isn’t my first rodeo and I know this is not a normal reaction). No we do not over feed her. We think this is more of a function of her not walking and running than anything else. 
7. Background: She had a lot of trouble feeding as a baby. Shrieked and shrieked and shrieked and would not take. We eventually switched to formula and had difficulties there are well. Again the doctors said there was nothing wrong. 
8. Background: she was born with clubfoot which was corrected with casts in her first year. Again, this could be used to explain late walking— but not the talking.

We are at our wits end here. We live in New York and have taken her to every therapist that has been recommended to us (speech, motor skills, etc) and nothing has made a difference. We love her so much. We just want answers and are so frustrated with doctors that are not giving us any concrete answers. It’s the not knowing that is so hard for us. A diagnosis would be welcomed because then we could do everything in our power to get her the help she needs. 

Any advice or guesses (even if they are a long shot) would be greatly appreciated.",175,54,2020-08-25,born early
AskDocs,"My chronic tachycardia has been getting rapidly worse and I’m being told not to worry, despite getting weaker by the day","Sex: Female
Race: Caucasian 
Age: 17
Height: 5’7
Weight: 108lbs
Medical history: asthma, vitiligo, Raynaud’s syndrome, mitral valve prolapse, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Medications: Wellbutrin (for depression), Adderall (for ADD/ADHD), Flovent (for asthma)
Drug Use: none

TL;DR I’ve been progressively having more heart issues (rapid heart rate, bouts of angina, and valve prolapse/regurgitation) that have begun to affect my ability to do simple day-to-day tasks like standing and walking. I’m not sure if I should be worried and seeking further help or not 

—————————

I’ve been essentially permanently tachycardic since I was born, my heart always beating too fast for my size. My bpm is never below 110 on a good day now. I was also born with a heart murmur that went away in its own by the time I was 18 months-2 years. I’ve had episodic symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, and extreme and sudden fatigue for most my life, likely as a result of the tachycardia. 

Post-puberty (11-12ish) these episodes became more frequent but I also got better at avoiding them. Overexposure to heat or cold were the main triggers, along with inconsistent sleeping and eating. I didn’t exercise a lot during this time but when I did it was about 50/50 if I’d have an episode or not. This was brushed off mostly as hormonal changes and typical growing issues. It stayed that way until about 3 years ago when my Raynaud’s started presenting itself.

Things didn’t become dramatically worse until mid 2019 when my renewed interest in sports pushed me past a wall. I was working out harder than I ever had before and my heart couldn’t keep up. I was in the ER twice in 1 month and my mother would argue I should have been there more. The symptoms progressed to the point that I was barely able to breathe, I was losing coordination, losing strength over my entire body, and that’s on top of the normal symptoms. Things only felt okay when I laid in bed. After one of these episodes, an ER nurse and doctor on staff did some basic tests and decided I had POTS (Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome). I was booked with a cardiologist to confirm the diagnosis. I was told that while the tests showed I fell well into the criteria for POTS.... it was just a normal part of growing and they’d check it out if it’s still happening when I’m 25 (they heavily implied I was just being a dramatic teen girl). After pushing, they finally agreed to do an EKG and ultrasound. Turns out I have a mitral valve prolapse. They still told me that it was no biggie and they’d keep an eye on it when I’m older and it’s *actually* causing problems. 

After this I cut a lot of activities and focused on staying healthy for my job, which is 100% on my feet, 100% of the time. Directing my health towards that goal (if that’s the right word) seemed to help. I still had symptomatic moments, and the more severe symptoms never went away, but it lessened once I cut rigorous activity and began focusing on everyday health and stamina. 

Fast forward to this summer (July-ish) and it has rapidly become much worse. I’ve continued my proactive stance but it’s not helping anymore. It’s near daily that I have episodes. I can’t shower alone anymore because I need someone to keep me stable. I’ve lost 10lbs in the past month alone and I was petite before. At first I was able to adrenaline through episodes at work but it’s become progressively harder. I’ve had to leave work early ~5 times now, twice in just the past week. It’s been getting worse and worse and since this weekend I can barely stand-up long enough to change my clothes. 

On Monday morning I went into work for the 5am opening shift and felt not great, but alright enough. I get five minutes into washing the windows and all the sudden it hit me again. By the time my co worker got there at a little after 6am, I was struggling to breathe and couldn’t muster the strength to push a swing door open. I had an appointment with a new Internist booked for that day, coincidentally, to talk about my ongoing health issues. I got to that appointment as early as they’d let me in and my heart rate was in the 150’s after sitting for 10+ minutes. 

During that appointment I finally got my EDS diagnosis independently confirmed (We had specialists tell us they thought my brother and I had it for years, but my former doc thought I was too young to diagnose) which was a relief. Unfortunately, I feel like my heart issues were overlooked as just “part of it” and much more attention was paid to my bendy joints and party tricks than my heart that was actively making it hard to even sit up straight. They found that my mitral valve was regurgitating blood into the wrong ventricle and told me how not good that is, but wouldn’t even acknowledge it for the rest of the appointment. The doctor doesn’t even want to do genetic tests for the Ehlers cardiovascular types to rule them out because there’s not enough of a history of aneurysms in my family. She says I show every marker for POTS but when I asked if I’d be tested for that instead, she said that’s not important at this time and we’ll worry about it in a few months or years. 

I feel like I’m going crazy. 

I haven’t been able to stand for any period of time without symptoms since Sunday morning. I had to leave work again after standing clutching a countertop to keep from falling for 2 hours. 

It just keeps getting worse. My girlfriend has been monitoring me full time and she knows this is so much worse than episodes before. My mom feels the same way. Hell, the doctors feel the same way, but they keep telling me it’s not a priority anyways. 

I don’t understand it. I can’t walk without holding a wall but it’s not a priority? I don’t track my vitals on the daily or anything, that’s not my thing, but I can tell it’s getting worse. Every time I see a doctor it’s worse. I don’t know what’s going on and I can’t find answers. I keep getting told that they don’t think it’s diagnosable so they won’t do the diagnostic tests to rule things out. Even if it was diagnosable, in their eyes, it’s not worth the time because it’s not treatable until your heart starts failing apparently. 

I don’t understand how that’s helpful. It’s not helpful because I’m not physically okay RIGHT NOW.

The promotion I was lined up for at work has all but disappeared because this episode has made me unreliable. I don’t feel safe to drive so I can’t get anywhere. It’s debilitating. I’m genuinely scared for my life and future. 

I guess my question is just what do you guys think? Is it just a normal part of teenage development? Is it worth getting tests done? Is it dangerous? Are there any steps I should be taking? How serious is this issue, actually? What are probable causes?

I’m scared for my future, but I’m more scared for my life at this point. I just need to hear some different voices",9,22,2020-11-05,born early
AskDocs,"Four weeks pregnant; first ultrasound which finished up after-hours, tech had radiologist read it immediately, was told I need to call my doctor “ASAP” tomorrow. What are the reasons for something like that?","UPDATE: Doc called me this morning and said to come in immediately. Though, I’m not sure why, as it’s more hurry up and wait. I’m 4 weeks approximately, and they’re not seeing a baby anywhere. No fetal pole, gestational sac, or yolk sac. My endometrium lining is 12mm, which was described as “thick”. I also have a hemorrhagic cyst on my right ovary, which is 17x12mm. 

As another update... The report states: 17x12mm complex cystic structure with low level internal echoes right adnexum. Vascularity along peripheral margin without internal septation or vascularity.

Hi all.

Thyroid issues (hypo)  
Never smoker

As title states, I went in for my first ultrasound today. It was to see if the Mirena IUD had dislodged, but the tech said it wasn’t there. Must have expelled it.  
  
However, she spent a lot of time imaging my right side with a transvaginal wand. When she finished, she asked me to stay put. She came back after about 15 minutes; said told me she had to have the radiologist read it immediately. She said the radiologist said I could go home, but call my doctor ASAP in the morning.  
  
What would be *possible* reasons for this? I understand it would all be speculative for my circumstance, but there must be some emergencies that require an immediate read but not immediate care. Can anyone detail what those could be? My mind is stuck on ectopic and some kind of mass/cancer.

AskDocs,30 weeks pregnant and throwing up at night only,"Female, white, normal BMI, no medications, only conditions are pregnant (third trimester) and mild gestational diabetes, age 30, duration 2 days 

Last night and the night before, I threw up after some reflux/burping type symptoms. During the day after throwing up, I’m not too interested in food but I’m able to keep food and water down fine and I don’t feel sick, just a little worn down from previous throwing up. I did NOT have morning sickness earlier in my pregnancy this is new. I assumed it was maybe acid reflux so last night I took a Pepcid, however today I now have extremely liquidy diarrhea. 

I’m extremely confused because if this was stomach bug or food poisoning, wouldn’t I be throwing up more often, not just at night? I don’t have a fever and my blood pressure is normal. I am very scared and have no idea what is going on but my OB won’t let me go in because of covid concerns, even though she doesn’t think I have it.

AskDocs,34 weeks pregnant and baby weighs 2lbs.,"My sister is 34 weeks pregnant and the baby weighed just under two lbs last week (at 33 +1).  My sis sees her two doctors (OB/GYN and MFM) twice a week.  The baby had stalled in growth for a while (I am not sure how long) around the same time that my sister was discovered to have some blood clotting disorders.  She has been on blood thinners since about week 22.  Her OBGYN told us this week that the baby will not reach 4lbs before birth (sometime in the next 6 weeks)and will stay in the NICU until she does reach 4 lbs and can eat on her own.  Her original due date was Dec. 16.  Modified due date was Dec 27.  We were told this week she will not go past Dec 20.  Sis has opted to have a c-section whenever the doctors or her body decides it is time.

I can only find info on babies born that small at 24-26 weeks.  i can't find anything about a baby being that small at this gestational age. the baby has gained 10oz in the past month.  My sister's nurse told her today that this is a miracle baby.  I don't think they ever said as much but it is starting to be clear that the doctors and nurses did not expect the baby to survive this long.

My sister is single, 22, 5'1"".  she weighed about 100lbs but now weighs 124lbs.  she did smoke, drink and do drugs (weed, cocaine, meth) previously but I don't think she has done much more than weed in the 6 months before she got pregnant.  She has always had problems with eating and nausea and now has been diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and some other blood clotting disorders that we had no idea about.  the baby has checked out normal for chromosomal and genetic abnormalities.  No amniocentesis was done. her amniotic fluid values have been between 6 and 8.  baby did have some heart issues (two stenoses and a psuedo hole) but at the most recent ultrasounds the problems seem to have resolved.

Sex- female 

Height- 5’9

Weight-185

Race- white 

B- blood type with B+ daughter 

Current medications- Zoloft 50 mg 

Vaginal birth. 


Rhogam was not listed on my dispatch paperwork. I never signed saying I got it. I don’t remember getting it. Hospital says they gave it to me but they only have their word, not actual proof. 

I suffered from postpartum hemorrhaging after giving birth to my daughter. I had gestational diabetes during pregnancy that was managed with diet and metformin. I was induced at 39 weeks and my daughter was 8lbs 10oz. 

When my daughter was born they told me she had dandy walker syndrome due to a sonogram that was done at 38 weeks. Went to a neurologist ust who did an MRI and told me it’s a normal variant, she’s perfectly healthy and no follow up is necessary. 

They never massaged my stomach after birth, even with the PPH. They served food with mold all over it. I gave birth a year ago and I’m still sad about my experience. I would like to have another child but I don’t know how the lack of rhogam shot would effect my already most likely high risk pregnancy.

AskDocs,Help determining date of conception,"26, female, 4 foot 10, 120lbs, Asian. I’m trying to verify the approximate date of conception of my pregnancy. I am currently about 8 months pregnant as far as I know. I had an unwanted sexual experience last September, and then had regular consensual sex with my husband in October. I found out I was pregnant in November and as far as I know the baby was conceived in October. I’m pretty sure it was, but I still get worried that something weird might have happened and caused ultrasounds or hcg levels to be off, like if my body produced hcg so slowly that it seemed like the baby was conceived in October but it was actually earlier? Is this possible?

Data points:  

* Period Sept 9-12 (sex Sept 12)  
* Possible period or spotting Oct 10 (31 day cycle)  
* Positive pregnancy test November 11  
* Quantitative HCG test Nov 12: 882.5 mIU/mL (5-6 weeks?)  
* Ultrasound Dec 20 placing me at 9w6d (expected 10+1 based on LMP)  
* Ultrasound Jan 3 placing me at 12w (expected 12+1)  
* Ultrasound Mar 4 placing me at 19w6d (expected 20+6)  
* Ultrasound Apr 16 placing me at 25w6d (expected 27w)  

A few more points:

* I have had periods ranging from 24-32 days but usually had regular periods around 28 days. I believe my LMP was Oct 10 which was a 31 day cycle from Sept 9-Oct 10. I don’t know if I remembered it correctly or if maybe it was some kind of early pregnancy spotting instead.  
* I took Plan B back in June which led to a couple very short cycles (15 and 19 days) before returning to normal length. I don’t know if that would affect my ovulation pattern.  
* I was taking Monistat before my September cycle hit and don’t know if that has any effect on ovulation timing either.  
* I have always been very petite and was less than 100lbs before pregnancy, I was born full term but physically “premature,” I don’t know if this would have any relation to a baby growing slowly.

No ultrasounds since then and I may not get another one. All the dates seems to indicate conception during October. I am told early ultrasounds are very accurate. But is there any unusual situations that could cause ultrasounds or HCG to be a month off when dating pregnancy? Does a gestational age of 10 weeks (like in my December ultrasound) always indicate conception around 8 weeks ago or is it possible to have conceived earlier than that? Or should I assume that it was definitely October?

Thank you very much in advance.",2,6,2020-06-04,gestational age
AskDocs,Help me make sense of my placenta pathology report,"20F, I delivered my daughter almost a year ago and was never informed that my placenta was being examined. I honestly just stumbled upon this report when looking for my lab reports for a recent doctors visit. Anyways, I had hypertension throughout most of my pregnancy, and saw a mfm specialist from 20 something weeks until the end of my pregnancy. All of my ultrasounds were fine, I suppose. I was never placed on blood pressure medications despite many high readings of 160/90+. I was hospitalized a few times due to high readings but protein was never found and therefore I was always fine to go home. Ultimately, I was induced at 35 weeks for a reading of 180/100. I guess I am just wondering if these are normal findings for a preterm labor or something that I should bring up/ or be worried about when I plan to have more children in the future.

I'm tired of no one taking me seriously and wanting to rush out the door in quick 15 minute appointments. My primary care doctor isn't concerned because that seems to be my set point - I've weighed 80 lbs since middle school. And my psychiatrist has told me he's just plain baffled about my case.

I was born at 24 weeks gestation at a very low birth weight of only 1 pound and 8 ounces, and spent 3 months in the NICU where I experienced complications of:

-	Tension Pneumothorax due to perforating my lung while intubated in the NICU. Apparently I also accidentally pulled out my own NG tube too. Yay me! 
-	Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC).
-	Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), probably exasperated by the disseminated intravascular coagulation.
-	A colostomy, had a stoma bag for 6 months until the DIC and NEC got better and my colon could be anastomosed. Good thing I don't remember any of it.
-	Had my bowel resectioned because of the necrotizing enterocolitis. I have a massive scar above my belly button that goes from one side of my stomach to the other.
-	A hole in my heart that later closed. Thank goodness.

Currently as an adult, I still have: 

-	Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) due to 100% oxygen toxicity. I am visually impaired. Doctors tried using scaleral buckles and laser surgery on both eyes when I was born to try and save my retina from detaching but things didn't turn out well. I'm completely blind in my left eye and have 20/100 vision in my right eye. The left eye has a cataract and calcium build up but it's been stable for years and my pediatric ophthalmologist thinks there's no point in risking things and doing surgery to remove it if I can't see out of the eye anyway.
-	Very minor cerebral palsy, caused by intracranial bleeding due to the DIC. I received occupational and physical therapy when I was a young child but I don't remember much of it.
-	Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). I don't experience any symptoms of it at all except for frequent nose bleeds. They're not too bad now that I'm older, but when I was in elementary school, my nose could easily bleed for 30-60 minutes or more. My record is a bloody nose in kindergarten that lasted over two hours because a stray kickball came flying out of nowhere during recess and hit me right on my nose. 
-	I have the Hemoglobin E Thalassemia Minor trait. Thanks, mom and dad.
-	Tachycardia. Resting heart rate of 110+ BPM.

AskDocs,[33F] My grandmother died of CLL and now I have lymphocytosis...,"After years of being told ""you're probably just fighting something"" in response to my elevated lymphocyte counts, my new PMD has referred me to a hematologist. My first visit isn't until 9/21, and only after that will I be able to have flow cytometry done. But in the meantime, could someone potentially provide me an impression of what might be going on?

Background on me: I have a history of childhood temporal lobe epilepsy, which has been in remission for 10 years (I don't currently take medication); I take Vyvanse (60mg) for ADD and Wellbutrin extended release (150mg) for depression; I have MODY-2 (mimics diabetes) with consistently elevated fasting glucose levels between 99 and 110 but normal 2-hour glucose tolerance tests (I'm not on any treatment); familial hyperlipidemia; a BMI that generally fluctuates between 18.5 and 19; I don't smoke and I drink infrequently.

Long-term symptoms that I can't explain: I have had nightsweats for 5+ years, but supposedly that is a side effect of Wellbutrin; when I am stressed, I get extremely painful ulcers/canker sores on my gums, back of the throat, under tongue, sometimes hard palate, and in the corners between my cheeks and gums--this has been getting worse in the past 10 years; I have frequent sinus issues; I occasionally get low fevers when I am stressed out; before testing positive for MODY-2 in 2017, I was being worked up for LADA/type 1.5 diabetes and tested positive for GAD-65 autoantibodies and insulin autoantibodies--but I've strangely tested negative ever since.

Family history: My mother has scleroderma and several other autoimmune conditions, but my ANA panels have always come back negative. She also tested positive for the genetic mutation which causes MODY-2 (she also had gestational diabetes when pregnant with me). She and my sister also have consistently elevated LDL levels as I do.

My maternal grandmother was diagnosed with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in 2014 and was treated. It was apparently controlled for a few years, but an incidental finding during a doctor's visit for an infected mosquito bite in 2017 revealed that she had a disseminated fungal infection (mucormycosis) most likely due to CLL having destroyed her immune system. She died just 2 months later on Christmas day, 9 days after her 80th birthday.

I know that CLL is highly uncommon in people under the age of 55, but seeing as my grandmother had it, and we haven't found any concrete evidence that I have an autoimmune condition or chronic infection, I wonder if I may be in the early stages of CLL? One interesting thing is that I used to donate bone marrow for research in the late 2000's, but I was eventually turned away in 2010 because of an issue with my white blood cells. (I've called the lab to see if they can look up the full reason I was told I couldn't donate again).

I also had worsening symptoms starting in March when I thought I had COVID-19 (fever, COVID-toes, gastro symptoms, fatigue, shortness of breath, sore throat, nightsweats, tingling in my limbs)--I got swabbed in April but it came back negative, and I subsequently tested antibody negative in April and May. The gastro symptoms subsided, as did the toe rash and fevers, but I still have bad nightsweats and have noticed that exercise is becoming exceedingly difficult for some reason, whereas I was very active before.

Here are my absolute lymphocyte counts for the past 5 years, all of which have been flagged on the lab results as abnormal: 

7/2016: 3.24 (range: 0.7-3.1 x10E3/uL)
8/2017: 4.39 (range: 0.85-3.9 x10E3/uL)
8/2018: 4.24 (range: 0.85-3.9 x10E3/uL)
10/2019: 3.80 (range: 0.7-3.1 x10E3/uL)
8/2020: 4.67 (range: 0.85-3.9 x10E3/uL)

I know that I wasn't actively sick during my last three blood draws, and most likely not sick for the others. If not CLL or leukemia, what else could it be?

AskDocs,Pediatric aphasia,"This is about my 7 year old son. (White, a little over 50th percentile for height, BMI around 50th percentile; 37 weeks gestation, no known anoxic injuries at birth, has met milestones on time). He has had PE tubes places three times, and is slightly far sighted. 


He had a non-fatal drowning about a year ago, he did not need to be resuscitated. No significant head injuries. Otherwise completely unremarkable history. Brother has hypotonic CP.  Family history of Lewy Body dementia and Parkinson’s. 


As long has he has been able to talk, my son has had difficulty with word retrieval. He used circumlocution from a very early age. I thought it was cute, I’ve never heard a 3-year-old describe a banana for 5 minutes because they can’t remember the word “banana.”  He would describe what you do with it, where we keep it in the house, and where to find it in the grocery store.  When he can’t remember “ball,” it’s “the thing the Red Sox throw.”


We just started online school and part of online school in first grade to demonstrate understanding is sorting pictures or putting them in order and then recording yourself explaining. The problem is, he can’t name the pictures.  When that happened I called my pediatrician and he send me SLP resources to help address aphasia. 


My question is: what causes aphasia?  Should we see a neurologist for formal testing?

AskDocs,Hydrocephalus,"Also posted in  r/Medical

I (40F) have congenital hydrocephalus. My last shunt revision was in 1994! I was discharged as a paediatric patient and never had a new neurosurgeon after that.

In 2018 I was suffering migraines and sent for a CT which came back clear. It turns out I was in early stages of pregnancy and developed gestational diabetes early on and needed insulin. The diabetes disappeared after the birth. The diabetes and pregnancy seemed to account for my symptoms as I felt better after I was on insulin and the birth. I delivered via elective c-section as they felt that was safer than labouring or pushing for hours.

However, I am still having headaches and migraines, especially lately. I strongly feel I need an MRI and feel I need a new shunt. I'm not sure if it's a blockage but could I have a cyst or perhaps an infection? Are VP shunts meant to last a lifetime? I just don't feel right. I have written to the hospital I was originally treated in but the notes I received are incomplete. I only know it's a Delta shunt but nothing more. It isn't a programmable shunt, as far as I know. But until doctors know more, they refuse to do an MRI in case it is dangerous? or intervenes with my shunt type. I feel very abandoned and helpless.

I'm not in US. Anyone any advice or experience. My GP did send a referral to a neurosurgeon but due to COVID 19 I'm still waiting. I feel cognitively something isn't right. It's taking an age to type this.",3,1,2020-06-08,gestational age
AskDocs,Questions about NT test/potential chromosomal abnormalities in pregnancy,"I was hoping someone could answer some question about an NT test in pregnancy. If there is a sub that is focused on medical professionals who deal with pregnancy that this question would be a better fit, please let me know! I am going to be following up irl with a medical professional, but the conversation with my family doctor (where I live we don't get OB appointments until 20 weeks) was overwhelming and he didn't seem to have a lot of knowledge about this specifically. I'm waiting to be contacted by a genetic specialist but it may take up to 2 weeks to hear from them. 

I am sorry this post is so long!!!!!

Background info about me (please ask if you need more info):

* Female
* Age 26
* First pregnancy 
* Non smoker
* Overweight (I'm about 5'6 and pre pregnancy I was 200lbs, now I'm about 205 lbs)
* Approximate due date is between Nov 28 - Dec 3
* So I'm about 13 weeks along
* I had an NT test done combined with blood work (was called First Trimester Screening on my paperwork) and it came back as a positive result with the odds of 1 in 200
* My DR said the neck/fluid measurement was normal but there were issues with my hormone levels
* So far I have no other problems in my pregnancy other than pretty bad morning sickness (I am on Dicletin)
* I just had blood drawn to do an NIPT test yesterday and waiting for the results hopefully in 7-10 days.

Questions: 

1) Exactly how accurate is the NT test? I understand it is screening and not diagnostic. I understand it has approximately a 5% false positive rate. Is 5% ""a big"" false positive rate compared to other tests?

2) The cut off for what constitutes a positive NT result seems to vary a lot. My DR said anything under 1:240 is considered positive. My Mom (nurse at hospital, but not in OB) said she was surprised I was given positive result because her hospital characterizes positive as less than 1:200. I see online in some countries they consider it less than 1:150 or less than 1:300. Basically how ""bad"" is this result considering it seems to be on the borderline of what a lot of places consider positive result?

3) Can a NT test combined with blood work be inaccurate/give a false positive if I am not at the gestational age (not sure if this is the right term sorry) that they think I am at? The reason why I ask this is because based on my periods my doctor assigned me the due date of Nov 28, an early ultra sound done at about 6 weeks said this was accurate. When I went for my ultrasound at 12 weeks to get this NT done, the ultrasound tech said the due date wasn't accurate and the test couldn't be done because the baby was only measuring 4cm and need to be at least 4.5cm for the test. She said I was more likely 10 weeks a long at this point but then after she did more measurements she said maybe 11 weeks. I understand that basing on periods is not always accurate and ovulation doesn't necessarily happen at the same time, but to me this new due date wouldn't make sense in terms of when I began having pregnancy symptoms and had a positive pregnancy test result. So I had to wait another week to get the NT test done. I am wondering if it was at the wrong time, could this affect the results? 

4) If the result is accurate, based on having normal neck/fluid measurements and wrong hormone levels what are the more likely chromosomal problems? (Again, I understand this is screening and I would diagnostics, I am just curious). 

5) How much more accurate is an NIPT test compared to an NT? Especially rate of false positives?

6) In terms of diagnostics.. What is the difference between a CVS and amniocentesis? Which is more accurate? Which is higher risk?

7) Based on the result of a 1:200 chance on the NT and a 1:200 chance of miscarriage doing an amniocentesis, would you do further testing or would it be considered too risky?",3,1,2020-05-28,gestational age
AskDocs,"Mysterious GI sickness in pregnant woman, very worried","Age 30, 30 weeks pregnant, white, normal BMI, taking prenatal and iron supplement, mild gestational diabetes 

Here’s the timeline of illness:

Friday night: heartburn/acid reflux when lying down which turned into me throwing up everything I ate that day. Assumed I ate something bad. I’ve had acid reflux this whole pregnancy so nothing new. 

Saturday: still felt a little weird from last night but felt better over the course of the day. Then felt nauseous again come nighttime. Again as soon as I go to bed I start regurgitating then vomiting everything. 

Sunday: wake up feeling uninterested in food but not nauseous. Lots of burping/reflux stuff. Start having watery diarrhea that subsides in the afternoon but then returns at night. Didn’t throw up that night. 

Monday: generally feeling shitty but no nausea. Lots of burping. Still diarrhea but it comes and goes. 

Tuesday: feel totally fine. Normal appetite, no diarrhea. Back to my old self. 

I have no idea what this was and I’m worried it could have been dangerous or contagious to my husband or baby. I never even ran a low grade fever, so my doctor suggested it was a sensitivity to my iron supplements, which I stopped taking on Sunday. Recovery happened really suddenly. I’m very worried it could have been covid,  but my husband is in the house 24/7 and the last time I left the house was to see my OB, where I wore full PPE including goggles and N95. That was 10-11 days before I started feeling sick. My doctor doesn’t think it was covid. My parents think it was just “weird pregnancy stuff.” Meanwhile I’m terrified my husband is about to fall sick.

I've been with her for 2 years and we've only recently started seeing this. Just before Covid, she went to the hospital in February because of extremely heavy flow and cramps of lovecraftian proportions, and the doctors told her that she had posterior fibroids.

AskDocs,"Infant girl three weeks of age has had two choking incidents , one of which made her spend her first Christmas in hospital.","Bit of a heavy one here, but I NEED advice.
(Also sorry for the spelling and grammar I’m not the smartest when it comes to that stuff.)

So on the first of December I gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl. She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because ‘that’s how babies are designed ‘ , but they didn’t see it , they didn’t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things.
Nevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn’t of helped her.

Fast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.

Now here’s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree! 
Now me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can’t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don’t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can’t enjoy any time with her because I’m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can’t over the past few days.

Hello, hoping someone can help put me out of my misery. My (33f) husband (46m) and I have two children and thought we were done. I have had the mirena IUD since our 2 year old was born. 

My last menstrual period was early-mid August, but a week after it ended I started spotting and have been since. Hubs and I had sex 28th August. This past Tuesday I woke with cramping that felt unusual, I thought something was wrong with my mirena but thought I would take a home pregnancy test to rule it out. Shock horror it was positive. Initially I was horrified,  thought my family was complete but have since come to believe if this ends up being viable we will be thrilled. 

Went to the hospital for bloods, hcg level was 99. Went back thursday and levels are 85. Which I think means this is unviable? I have to go back saturday for another test to see if they continue to fall. 

My question being, is this a definite miscarriage? Is a slight fall definitely a miscarriage? The spotty stopped yesterday and I feel fine otherwise. Is there a chance this could be visble or do i need to resign myself to this not happening? This is our last (surprise) shot as hubby just had a vasectomy a week ago (typical luck for us). 

Also will the iud need to be removed? 

And on the off chance this pregnancy continues, is removing the iud or leaving it in better medically?

Child was born via C Section after two extended heart rate drops into the 70s for roughly 5-7 minutes while awaiting vaginal birth at scheduled hospital visit.

The rest of the pregnancy was unremarkable. Heart rate was always normal and we were not told of any issues at any of our appointments. There was a cold the mother had in February that lasted about a week in which she had moderate congestion and a mild cough. The babies growth is asymmetrical, despite being small her body looks proportional. Eyes aren't huge, or oddly spaced, nose, lips and chin look normal. The head doesn't appear to be peculiarly shaped. All of her labs are normal, heart screen, blood work, hearing screen. She does have slight jaundice which appears to have already cleared or in the process of clearing. Yellow BMs have passed as well as the yellowish tint to her skin. She is being breast fed exclusively and is being fed roughly every two to three hours. Doctors, nurses, etc at the hospital didn't mention any problems. The doctor said she couldn't be any more healthy.

Because of the small HC. We are curious as to if we should be expecting mental or physical developmental problems? Mother does have a smaller head, but nothing you would notice looking at her, and was born with a AGA HC. Father has a slightly larger head, but again was born with a AGA HC.

D.O.B 02/02/2020 (19 weeks/5 months old)
26.5” currently (21” at birth)
15lbs6oz currently (8lbs11oz at birth)
White
Full-term/vaginal delivery 
Multiple masses spanning over entire left leg
Noticed and sought treatment April 29th

My daughter has multiple masses within her left leg. The size/pressure has caused her to lose the ability to move her foot. She has seen quite a few specialists that determined she had a vascular/lymphatic malformation with multiple macrocystic hygromas. We were referred to The Hemangioma and Vascular Malformation Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and were seen within a month. 
Nine days after her initial appointment she was scheduled for surgery. Her masses were to be drained and then sclerotherapy was to be performed. 
Roughly 45 minutes after entering the OR my fiancé and I were called to a small room to discuss revised treatment options with her radiologist and newly appointed general surgeon. Her mass was unable to be drained as intended because the contents were thicker than intended and contained tissue(s). 
The general surgeon went on to perform her surgery - removing approximately 200mL of fluids, inserted a drain into her calf, and collected samples for pathology. 
During her time in post-anesthesia recovery: her mass had “refilled” and was nearly the same size/fullness as it was prior to surgery; albeit the mass was not as firm. 
The following day her capillary refill rate and temperature improved in her foot. No notable improvements in her foot/ankle movement. However her hemoglobin levels were low prior to surgery, during anesthesia recovery, and dropped further post-op. After being monitored and given IV fluids we were released to go home. We were discharged with orders to visit a local children’s hospital for a CBC tomorrow (05/23) to rule out the need for transfusion. 
Today, (05/22) we received a call from the pathologist. We were told that the mass is not what she was initially diagnosed with: it is not a hermangioma/hygroma/lymphatic or vascular malformation/cyst. We were told that they aren’t certain what the mass is. We were also informed that cancer has not been ruled out. 
She will be seen this week for a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan, hopefully. 

I will include pre/post op photos and measurements. At this point I am just seeking some sort of direction, what we can possibly expect, what we need to be asking doctors, and if there is anything that anyone can do that isn’t currently being done. Myself and my fiancé want to do all we can but we are scared and at a loss currently. 
TIA.

**Please tell me flat out if I am simply being paranoid, delusional, manic or hyperactive after seeing my labs and reading my issue so I can lay it to rest**

In short, I've been seeing the same GP since I was 6 years old. I was adopted and raised in Canada from Bulgaria. Despite many trips to the hospital for Bloodwork, Fainting, Low-Vision, and Sleep-Trouble (among others), my GP has assured my family that ""everything came back normal"" and insisted no specialist (endochrinologist etc) was needed and that her prescriptions are all I need. 
I've been getting gradually worse, and have decided to take my medical records for a review, and seek a second opinion from another doctor. Am I jumping the gun and being too harsh on my GP by abandoning her? Are my labs ""perfect"" and ""it's all in my head?""
**Am I just ""*complaining too much?*""**
I've added a few of the labs that were highlighted on my (large) file, and I would very much appreciate any insight as to whether the readings are indeed within the ""normal, fine"" range - or if I am just being a hypochondriac. 

Much appreciated!

Either way, I feel like I am 65 when I should be at the time of my life. I don't understand the purpose of so many tests if they are all returned ""normal"" and my GP says to keep my med regimen simply.

Im wondering if that same kick would of brought my mom into labor if it was 3 months earlier in the pregnancy. 

In other words, was the kick able to induce labor because my mom was at full term in the pregnancy? And would that same kick not induce labor if she wasnt as far along in the pregnancy?

AskDocs,Can a Penicillin Allergy Come On Slowly? Over The Course Of 8 Days?,"My 11 month old female daughter has been on Amoxicillin for an ear infection. Her weight is 18lbs, 30in long. She’s never been sick before, and has never taken antibiotics before this. She was a term birth and is up-to-date on all vaccines and received the flu-vac in October. Tomorrow will be day 8 of a 10 day Amoxicillin prescription. 4.5 ml, twice a day, 12 hours apart. 8am and 8pm. I’ve had a hell of a time with getting in touch with her doctors office throughout all of this because their office is a Covid testing center and our area is full of cases. Her pediatrician is currently out for the next three weeks(I’m not sure why), but I have an appointment scheduled with her as soon as she comes back in early January. 

More info: My mom has a severe allergy to penicillin drugs and sulfur drugs, and her brother also had a lot of drug allergies. Can drug allergies be hereditary/genetic?

Here are my notes so far, from the very beginning of her behavioral changes and ear infection:


Monday + Tuesday Dec. 7th + 8th - a bit more fussy and clingy than normal. Teething. 

Wednesday Dec. 9th - More fussy and clingy, fever of 101.2, called office and talked to nurse, was told to give Tylenol and if she didn’t improve or if her fever grew to take her to Same-Day Clinic. No improvement but fever did not grow, took her to Same-Day clinic. Ear infection was confirmed, was prescribed Amoxicillin, to be given 4.5ml 2x a day, 12 hours apart for 10 days. Started first dose that night, and continued giving Tylenol following the boxes instructions for pain and fever. Some time after first dose of Amoxicillin, I noticed a small speckled, but not upraised rash on her belly. Very restless night. It didn’t seem too bad and was gone by the next morning. 26oz breastmilk total.

Thursday Dec. 10th - continued with Tylenol for fever and pain, and continued with Amoxicillin. She took an extra 2 hour nap that evening. Around 8pm I gave her a dose of Tylenol and amoxicillin and started her night routine. I noticed she kept feeling warmer, so I checked her temperature. She had a fever of 102.4. I gave her a lukewarm bath to try to cool her down, and placed a cool washcloth on her head while seeing if the Tylenol just needed to kick in. The next time I checked her temp, she had a fever of 104.4. I took her to the ER immediately. Upon arrival her fever was 103. Around 9:30pm they gave her a dose of ibuprofen, and waited 45 minutes to see if her fever went down. It went up to 103.2. They did not do any testing, as they said they felt it was unnecessary since she had no other symptoms and that it was obvious her body was just fighting the ear infection. I mentioned the small and short-lasting belly rash she got at the first dose of Amoxicillin and the doctor wasn’t concerned. I was sent home with instructions to alternate Tylenol and ibuprofen every 3 broke until her fever broke and to call the office first thing in the morning to make an ER follow-up appointment. Popped a tooth that night, very restless night with little sleep. 24oz breastmilk total, not much solid food.

Friday Dec. 11th - I called the office first thing in the morning at 8am, and was told pediatrician wasn’t in and that a nurse would call me back. I called multiple times and never got to talk to a nurse or make an appointment. Her fever finally broke around 12pm. I continued with Tylenol and ibuprofen dosage to keep her comfortable, and still continued with Amoxicillin as directed. She took another abnormal late evening nap, and was still very fussy and clingy throughout the day. She began refusing to drink milk and eat food, and I had to start forcing her to drink. She had a fever twice that day, both around 101-102. Restless at night. 22oz breastmilk total. 

Saturday Dec. 12th - Still very fussy and clingy, and more tired than usual, even with extra nap. Still refusing to eat and drink. Continued with Amoxicillin. No fever but was given Tylenol/ibuprofen when she seemed in pain/uncomfortable. Popped another tooth. Slept better that night. 20oz breastmilk total. 

Sunday Dec. 13th - still more fussy and clingy and more tired than normal. No extra nap. Still refusing to eat and drink milk. Continued with Amoxicillin. No fever. Was given Tylenol once, and ibuprofen once. Better sleeping at night. 21 oz total. 

Monday Dec. 14th - called office multiple times to get an appointment made. Still refusing to eat and drink, still very tired. continued with Amoxicillin. No fever. Tried to see if Tylenol/ibuprofen shortly before eating/drinking would help, it didn’t. 20 oz total. 

Tuesday Dec. 15th - restless and fussy morning. Appointment with family medicine doctor. Ear infection seemed to be improving. Not much concern about eating/drinking aversion. Continued with Amoxicillin. Saw mood improvement later on in the day, still having feeding/drinking aversion that seemed to get better as day went on. 24oz total. Ate solid food well. 

Wednesday Dec. 16th- restless and fussy morning. Continued with Amoxicillin. 3 hours after Amoxicillin dose, noticed rash on outer left leg, small upraised speckles. Called office, was told a nurse would call back and to keep an eye on the rash. Rash seemed to be moving around body. Legs, arms, chest, and face. Coming and going. Some areas up-raised, some not. Did blanching test and rash went away/turned white with pressure. Rash got worse as the day continued, spread all over body and stayed. No fever all day. The rash didn’t seem to be bothering her at all. No call back from a nurse. Continued with Amoxicillin. She seemed fine otherwise. 27oz breastmilk total, ate solid food well. 


Note: She was not given any new food or drink during this whole time. Her usual breastmilk intake is around 27-31oz a day and she usually self-feeds solid foods very well. Besides the rash, she seemed normal and finally drank and ate more today than she has been. Should I be concerned about a penicillin allergy? I plan on calling her doctors office first thing in the morning if the rash isn’t gone. Due to Covid being so high in our area, and our healthcare being overwhelmed, I’m trying to do my best to care for her at home before taking her in anywhere. We have been completely social distanced and isolated before her ear infection. Her dad works socially distanced, and does all the errands and grocery shopping. She stays home with me 24/7. I’m a first time mom, and to be honest, I have no idea what I’m doing. I’m worried about her and just want this all to be over with. If you’ve read all this, I really really appreciate it.

Age:25 
Height: 1.76m
Pre-existing conditions: depression, anxiety. 

Hi I was prescribed 5mg Melatonin to take ""as needed"" before bed, and after night 1 of taking it, I experienced extreme daytime sleepiness and felt very groggy. I continued to take the Melatonin every night, since I'm in the final stages of submitting my PhD and I generally struggle to sleep. After about 7 nights of taking it, I started feeling extra depressed, groggy and started explaining to people that I have ""flu brain"" or ""foggy brain"", attributing my issues speaking, reading, and even writing to possibly developing a bad case of the flu, or just my general unusually high stress levels. However, at day 8, I noticed (by some grace) that while I thought I was typing full sentences/phrases, I actually only typed one word or two words, hence leaving out words but still believing I typed the whole sentence. I could barely remember what my PhD study was about, I couldn't read without stumbling or struggling to pronounce words, and I had very bad short term memory. I informed my partner, but we attributed it to stress. By day 10, I needed my partner's help to write basic sentences and had severe short term memory issues and trouble speaking. I tried filling out a form for my partner, since I have a neat handwriting, but it was a struggle. I decided to not take the melatonin last night, and woke up feeling refreshed and ""normal"" again. However, my partner brought me the form I filled out the previous day, and said he now completely believes me on the issues I was describing concerning my writing difficulties. I looked at the form but could see nothing wrong, until he pointed out that I had left out i.e. the middle parts of words, etc. For instance, we live in Waterberry Street, but I wrote Waterry Street.
I have never taken melatonin before. 
I have been on the following prescribed medicine: Anxiolytics (0.5mg Azor) and antidepressants (50mg Serdep) as well as birth control meds (Zoely) long term. 
Can someone advise me if it might be the melatonin causing all of this? My Doctor prescribed the melatonin since it isn't available over the counter in my country, and assured me it would help me sleep, but did not elaborate on any side effects. I am really worried because I have tight deadlines and I now have to recheck all the writing I've done on my PhD in the last 10 days, given my strange impairments.

AskDocs,23F conglomeration of possibly unrelated health issues arise around same overseas travel period @ age 17-18 ?? other prior life circumstances explain it better??,"Hi everyone - first post in this kind of forum so I apologize if I don't follow the norms. I am just very curious about any opinions (namely medical opinions) of some health issues I've had. I know this is a lot and I'm sorry to anyone who feels it is too much. 

This will be basically my life story so maybe someone will be curious enough to sit on this but PLEASE FEEL FREE TO OUTRIGHT IGNORE THIS IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING THROUGH MY ENTIRE LIFE HISTORY 

Firstly, white, female, age 23, weight 110lbs, height 5'1'', from USA (always lived in one place here until age 17, barring travel to other places in US, Canada, and some US territories earlier in life - may be relevant info later). Ages of relevance for development of issues: 17-18, weight range at the time was ~ 105-115lbs, height unchanged 

I'm going to give a lot of information about myself, so I hope this is accepted without judgement and with meaningful consideration. My question is sort of broad and really I'm just looking to see if anyone with medical expertise can, given all this info that I've never disclosed to any doctor in person, piece together some reasonable ""medical narrative"" to explain something -- really, I am trying to understand whether certain factors are as relevant for my current health status as I think they might be, or what might make sense to explain these things, and finally, if (given the possible source of these issues if the factors discussed do seem relevant) there is some way to address all of these things in some broad overarching way. I will explain more clearly soon and clarify my question, but first I'll give background.. 

When I was 17, I traveled to Sweden for 1 year as an exchange student. Before that year, I never really had any health conditions and was quite healthy and always fairly healthy physically but not at all athletic (did some manual labor and light exercise, lots of walking). However, a lot of unhealthy habits and psychological issues --- Since age 13 I smoked cigarettes (finally quit three months ago at age 23!), and from age 14-16 had done a lot of drinking, a lot of drug use (various drugs inc. opioids, marijuana, benzos, and at age 17 only some psychedelics). Ages 11-16 I experienced ongoing sexual abuse and other unrelated sexual trauma. Age 15 my dad died then I attempted suicide by antihistamine overdose (not very smart, also undershot dosage a LOT but still enough that I was severely hallucinating and hospitalized and incoherent for days -- glad for that now). I was diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety (though I really think it was just social anxiety) and PTSD. Briefly was on Wellbutrin, Zoloft, and some PTSD medication to take at night, I don't remember what, all only for a few months at age 16. 

SIDE NOTE - sorry to throw all this in like that, but I know unresolved trauma can manifest as physical health issues too and I don't know if drug use or the OD could be relevant or manifest in some health effects later on, so I wanted to give full disclosure. If this is inappropriate for this forum please feel free to report/block my post or redirect me if you have a better place for this. 

Okay anyway, age 17 I left for this study abroad. While I was in Sweden, **(--1--)** I did not have any menstruation for about three months (had NEVER happened, was totally regular before that and never any bad cramps, not very heavy; had very briefly tried pill form of birth control age 15 but caused mood swings so I stopped and things did re-regulate after a few months). Ever since my menstrual cycle started back up after that episode, I have had VERY VERY VERY SEVERE menstrual cramps, still not very heavy bleeding though. When I say VERY VERY VERY SEVERE, I mean that I would be home for 2 days at the start of every menstrual cycle unable to move or even think and deeply feared this every month. I would be writhing around and crying the entire time. No OTC medication helped.  I saw several doctors about this and some just told me vaguely to change my diet or quit smoking (eventually did, though diet change never helped) and some suggested off hand that I might have endometriosis but never did any follow ups, some just said to get on birth control pills, which I didn't want to do again. I didn't heed the smoking advice for a long time because, quite naturally, as an addict I discarded such suggestions. In any case, I had been smoking long before this issue arose, so I didn't think that was the sole cause. This has gotten better since getting an IUD (kyleena) but occasionally is horrific still (menstruation is super rare and irregular now). Ovulation also used to be immensely painful starting the same time as menstruation but has gotten better since 2-3 months after I got the IUD. 

Also during this year in Sweden age 17-18, I **(--2--)** caught some stomach bug (severe cramping and diarrhea after every meal for almost a month, very sudden onset after eating some local lettuce that did not make any of the other Swedes who ate it sick) -- this was never treated. Ever since then, and never before, I have had serious issues with digestion, including IBS symptoms (back and forth between constipation and diarrhea, with either I very often get very severe intestinal pain that feels like cramping) that are not resolved by diet restrictions (reactions to particular foods have changed over time), not resolved by fiber increase (though Citrucel is helpful some of the time -- I take this daily now and it has helped quite a bit, but sometimes does not help for a span of 1-2 weeks at a time, seemingly random and not coinciding with stress or diet changes)

Also around the same time as both of these things, I **(--3--)** suddenly developed pretty severe environmental allergies (pollen, I'm guessing, since it was around spring) and now ever since then, I can't go outside during pollination season / spring without taking OTC allergy meds -- my nose becomes really inflamed and itchy and I can't open my eyes because they water and burn too much and  I sneeze incessantly for > 1hr after going outside for just ~10 mins. This persists everywhere now, even back in my hometown. But again, this just suddenly one day started happening while in Sweden, and has persisted ever since, but I *never* had any allergies before (except to morphine, strangely).


So, I never had any health issues aside from psychological and addiction issues before this year, and since then, have had three chronic health issues that have all disrupted my day to day life.


What I really want to know is -- are these all seemingly related or unrelated? Could it ALL possibly come back to some delayed response to psychological trauma or is that a bit crazy to attribute it all to that? Do these things just happen to all arise sometimes in people at that age and this is all just a coincidence? Or could something about traveling to a foreign environment in particular have some relation to the development of all these long term issues? (namely the stomach bug)  

If it does seem like these might all tie back to something (which I can't tell if that's a silly idea, me just trying to find a coherent narrative to make sense of it all), is there some suggested way to address all of these things? I have no idea what I really mean by that, but like.. could it be some broader immune system issue either related to travel or trauma that can be resolved with a single treatment?? 

I don't really know what I'm asking exactly but if anything comes to mind to anyone to explain these things I would love to hear thoughts -- this has plagued me for several years now and in trying to see specialists about these things independently (well, never for allergies), I've never gotten any relief and just want to understand what happened to my body, all of a sudden 

and finally, if you've made it this far, thank you so much for giving me, some random internet stranger, so much of your time and energy and care -- I appreciate it even if you have nothing substantive to offer in response",2,5,2020-05-26,full term birth
AskDocs,29 weeks pregnant and baby only weighs 1lb 2oz.,"My(47F) 22 year old sister is pregnant. sis was adopted so that is why we have such an age gap.  I have been her sis/mom her whole life.  Our mom died of cancer when sis was 16.

 Sis is at 29 weeks gestationor 27. her OBGYN and fetal medicine specialist do not agree on due date.  it is sometime in mid to late December. she was told today that her baby only weighs about 1lb 2oz.  sis was diagnosed with Antiphospholipid syndrome at about 23 weeks.  this is her first pregnancy.  She was given notice earlier this week that she is being taken off work by the doctors.  she has been told she will probably be hospitalized sooner or later.  Genetic testing for the baby came back with no abnormalities.

I am just trying to figure out what to expect so I can support my sister.  My sister is single and lives alone. baby daddy makes promises but has yet to keep any. I am going to try to pay her bills so she doesn't stress too much but I need to know what to expect once the baby is born.  Due to the virus and my own work schedule, I have not been able to go to the doctor with my sis and ask her doctors these questions. She does not think to ask questions while she is at the doctor because she is so stressed and worried. I am not looking for any diagnosis with this post, more of a range of possibilities.  I feel like, with the baby this small currently, that it is too much to expect the baby will be small but otherwise perfectly healthy at birth.  Can anyone give me a range of possibilities from ""no problems, enjoy the baby"" to ""prepare for the worst""?  I don't know what is in between those two extremes. I don't think my sister could handle/deal with a baby with significant disabilities.  I know that no one knows for sure until the baby is born but I need to think about things before she gets here so I can deal with it. let me see if I can break it down to questions...

1. how likely is it that she will carry to term?
2. how likely is stillbirth at this stage?
3. how likely is a NICU stay?
4. how likely are life altering disabilities for the baby? severe disabilities?
5. what are the dangers to my sis with the blood clotting issue?
6. my sis just called and said the doctor says the baby's heart walls are very thick and she is not growing and she can't go on like this.  they are having her come back on Monday.

I am open to any discussion at this point.  I just feel like I need to be prepared.  My sis is surrounded by her friends that have all had healthy babies with absolutely no problems and were able to work the whole time and she did not think about any of this when she got pregnant and chose to continue the pregnancy.  I advised her to get an abortion because my sis has some untreated mental illness and substance abuse issues that she needs to address before she has a kid. And she wasn't working.  My dad kicked her out because the only thing he asked her to do as long as she lived in his house was to not get pregnant. she made the decision to keep the baby and I made the decision to support her and the baby as much as I can.

AskDocs,"[19F] lab results from my gyno came back---14nmol/L SHBG, but normal Testosterone and Progesterone (I'm also having an ultrasound in a week). Possible causes and Birth Control recommendations?","So, my blood results say:

6.7 pg/mL Free-Calc Testosterone

68 ng/dL Progesterone

Edit: also, I realized this may matter
 31ng/mL Vitamin D 25-OH



Also, I'm 5'3.5"" and 185 lbs.

History:
Appointment 1 a few months back: 
I came in for a separate, nsfw bleeding issue*, which went away in the weeks that followed. My doctor wanted me to come back in 6-8 weeks for a follow-up appointment, which I postponed a week because of my period and then another week because of taking plan B (a condom issue occured). 

At the second appointment, she would see if the bleeding was gone (it was), do a normal appointment, do some blood work and prescribe an extra form of birth control.

*there's no need for this post to be nsfw, but said bleeding may be relevant to my diagnosis, so I'll include a SFW explanation. The basic just is: I experienced bleeding from my cervix the first 2-3 months I began [insert euphemism here]-ing, and it eventually went away. There was also a lot of pain the first few times because I tore part of my hymen. (I think this is SFW, since these are medical terms for female anatomy, and I don't talk about specifics?)
.
Appointment 2, a two weeks ago: 
My doctor did a full exam and said that everything looked healthy; however, she recommended getting an ultrasound because she suspects I have pcos (due to longer cycles and excess hair) (which I though was a bit much, but agreed to without objection). She decided to wait to prescribe birth control until after the lab results were back and the ultrasound was done.
.
Appointment 3: will be in a week from now, I'm going to have an ultrasound, talk about my lab results, and hopefully be prescribed birth control
.
.
.
.
Here are my main questions:
1) Since I don't have increased Testosterone levels, is pcos still a possibility?
2) What birth control option would be best for increasing my SHBG level? I know some help, and I'm hoping to use the ring based on my habits and lifestyle. Would this be a good idea hormonally?

AskDocs,35F Painful ovarian cysts and constant increasing watery discharge,"Hi, 
I’ve posted before with related questions having to do with symptoms over the last year or so involving intermittent and sometimes severe pain, pressure, and fatigue. 

My post history has pretty exhaustive information in it about all that, but I’m currently experiencing a huge increase in one of the symptoms and need to ask advice. 

About a month ago I was diagnosed with a large-ish left ovarian cyst and moderate fluid retention in my abdomen through intravaginal ultrasound and told it is most likely a simple cyst and prescribed watchful waiting. I have an ultrasound and appointment scheduled for October 14th. 

One of the symptoms has been an increase in watery discharge, and while I’ve felt it’s been increasing, overnight it has gotten much worse. It feels similarly to when I was pregnant and my water broke. I woke up thinking I’d been bleeding, but instead it’s a constant leak of clear watery discharge with minimal odor. 


I’m just wondering if I need to speak to my doctor about this or wait for the appointment. 

I have a nexplanon birth control implant that is due out in April, not pregnant, and I’m average to underweight except for some gain in my abdomen in the last year. 
Had one full term birth and vaginal delivery three years ago and recent clean Pap smears but a history of severe cervical dysplasia and pain with sex. I also had a bartholin cyst marsupialization two weeks ago that has seemed to be healing well.

Hi, so like the title says everythings falling apart. Right now im going through some pretty bad mouth pain. My right side of my mouth has been hurting since monday or tuesday (may 18th or 19th), and my dumbass waited til friday to deal with it cause i was hoping it would just go away. At first it started as a dull ache in my lower right side seemed to be coming from my teeth, than on thursday and friday it was extereme pain that would come and go and i tried to go to urgent care on friday but im on state insurance and no urgent care would see me for dental issues while on state insurance, i also called my dentist friday but they aren't open to the public yet and they tried to help but they said it was because im not brushing my teeth (which im not), now yesterday and today its been pain when anything touches my teeth on that side or if they accidentally knock together i can only eat on one side of my mouth and sometimes the pain feels more like tightness than actual pain. Yesterday it was pretty severe pain where i went to my parents house for dinner and couldn't even eat there due to the pain. It's not as bad today but its still pretty bad. I had my wisdom teeth taken out in spring of 2018 so about two years ago, so i don't think its that. I feel like not brushing my teeth played a part in this but i don't think its going to solve the issue, and honestly the way my teeth are feeling now, i don't think i could brush them without being in severe pain. Also I called my dentist on friday and they said to brush my teeth more, but they said this over multiple phone calls and text messages including a picture of my mouth being sent, as they are my county's health department pregnant women and childrens dentist so they aren't even open to the public.

&#x200B;

Now the other issue. I have had vaginial bleeding two separate times basically within 1 or 2 weeks of each other. I'm on hormonal birth control pill and im only on continuously active pills no sugar pills/placebos. I'm on birth control because i noticed a trend of being in psych wards, being suicidal, wanting to self harm, having a regression in other symptoms, or a combo of all of the above during my periods, so i asked to be put on birth control, and it really helped for awhile. I saw the health department family planning doctor in probs january or february i told him all this and said that its not helping anymore that im still having the same issues on the sugar pill that i was having before i even started taking birth control, so now im on continously active pills. There shouldn't be any bleeding only spotting, however friday (may 22nd) and at some point  i think on the 14th or 7th of may i had major bleeding. not spotting like regular amount you would see in a period. the first time was followed by almost a weeks worth of spotting, and now im on my 2nd full day of spotting/minor bleeding.

So basically I'm asking for help with the mouth pain, because im in group housing and I don't think they will give me permission to go to the er for this, im pretty sure they'll have me wait til tuesday but idk if i can last that long. and im having period like bleeding when i shouldn't be if someone could help with either or both that would be great thank you  


Edit: I would like to add that im planning on calling doctors as soon as holiday weekend is over i just need to know if its something i should be freaking out about or not before this weekend is over.",5,3,2020-05-25,full term birth

A little background:

I recently went through the medical ringer when I suddenly had a 29 day long, incredibly heavy period that would not stop no matter what.. Four months passed where I had 19 -29 day long periods that were incredibly heavy and painful while only having a short reprieve between. 

I was diagnosed with a uterine polyp, and went in for a D&C soon after that. 

After lab results came back, I was told that the polyp came back with complex, atypical hyperplasia with squamous morules.  There was no active cancer present, but precancerous cells definitely were. 

I was sent to see another doctor, and was put on Megestrol for the next three months to make sure all of the carnage is cleared out of my uterus. 

My two doctors seem to be giving me two different opinions on the matter, though.

One is telling me that I should forego trying to have children and have a hysterectomy in order to squash the chances of cancer developing. He said he's never seen a full, healthy pregnancy come from a person who came back with complex cells before. 

The other doctor seems confident that I can conceive (albeit probably with the help of a fertility specialist and medications), and carry a baby full term. 

I wanted to get some other opinions on the matter and see if there is a chance that I could conceive and carry a healthy baby to birth, or is it not worth the risk?

AskDocs,[20F] I have been sneezing since June 2019 with no end in sight. It's affecting my sleep and nothing I do helps. Please free me from this nose prison.,"I am 20, female, live in the north of England, 5 foot 1, and I don't have a set of scales on hand but last I checked I was roughly 8 and half stone (about 120 pounds?). I have gone through a lot medical-wise the past 3 years, but I'm not sure how relevant any of it is to the sneezing but all of it tends to overlap so I'll leave all that information at the bottom.


Last June I was on holiday (France) and started sneezing. we dusted and cleaned the whole house and it didn't stop. I took antihistamines, nose sprays, nothing eased it. I had trouble sleeping as I couldn't breathe properly and would constantly need to sneeze or wipe my nose.


Came home from holiday and nothing changed. Cleaned the house, bedroom, changed sheets. Nothing. Would still take anithistamines and nose sprays, but no difference.


I moved house as I started University in October, still sneezing in the new house. Dusted, cleaned, still no changes. I would take antihistamines daily, giving up for a few weeks, then taking them again. Nose sprays still, but I gave up on them around Christmas time.My mother told me to hold my head over a bucket of hot water and drape a towel over my head. Everything started running out for a few minutes until it just suddenly stopped. My nose wasn't clear, it was just completely blocked. Throughout the winter I never got a cold, no coughing, no fevers. Just the same sneezing.


I was planning on going to the Doctors around Easter when I wouldn't be busy with Uni and I would be visiting home anyway. Then quarantine started before I could.


A couple weeks ago small spots of blood started to appear when I sneezed, these only lasted for a few days and I haven't seen any blood since. With it being Spring I can tell when I have hayfever as I have full sneezing fits that can last a few minutes straight and my eyes will get irritated, red, and watery. Sometimes I feel this enormous pressure behind my eyes and nose where it feels like I need to sneeze, can't, and then my body isn't sure what to do so it makes me cough instead.


In terms of colour, the first 2 sneezes of the day are very yellow, and then everything else is completely clear. 


I'm sorry this is long but I'm just not sure what to do. I've been in three different houses with no change in symptoms. I've taken antihistmines, nose sprays, tried to steam it out. Nothing is working. I can't sleep properly, I wake up at about 9am, no matter what time I went to bed, with sneezing fits and can't go back to sleep. I just want to be freed from this hellish nose-prison.

 3 years ago, I lost about 2 stone in a just under a month, no appetite, very pale, heavy periods. Was put on birth control and iron as they said I was anemic.

Amongst all of this I've had impetigo twice. Was given Fucidin H cream both times, it all cleared up.

# BIO AND MEDICAL HISTORY

My GF, ""T"" for the sake of brevity, is 28 years old, white, 6 feet tall, and weighs about 180 pounds. She has a whole slew of medical issues that we have been very diligent about managing for the past few years. Her issues started with mono, which at the time didn't seem odd. What follows is a series of odd diagnoses, especially for someone her age and relative health. I am listing her recent medical history in case it may relate to the symptoms she's displaying with regard to her concussion. 

T was concussed in March of 2018. She was at first diagnosed with a mild concussion, but then it was upgraded to the level above that, but not severe (I'm sorry I can't remember the exact term for it - but it was between mild and severe). Looking back, this concussion seems to be just a random incident among a sea of other diagnoses that doctors seem to all think are related. 

A few months after her concussion, in June or July, T had pericarditis, and became a cardiac patient. She's since been diagnosed with SVT and takes Bystolic to manage her cardiac symptoms. Doctors told us the pericarditis was an infection that had most likely traveled from her stomach as she had a stomach bug just before we went to the emergency room when she was exhibiting severe chest pain symptoms which turned out to be the pericarditis. At this point, we were just thinking we had some serious bad luck the past few months and hadn't really connected anything. 

The following summer, June of 2019, T went to the hospital with Clostridium difficile colitis (c. diff). She was treated and recovered, but has had serious GI problems ever since. At this point, doctors and ourselves started to realize their was something going on since T was an otherwise healthy woman in her 20s who had now had pericarditis and c. diff which are very odd for someone her age, as I've come to understand. 

Other more minor problems have reinforced the theory that something is wrong with T's immune system. She got an ear piercing that was so infected it rapidly spread to the bone near her ear and she also had a seriously adverse reaction to a vaccine (that I can't remember) that hospitalized her. 

After the c. diff, she began seeing an infectious disease doctor and an immunologist and her full-time job, basically, has been getting to doctor's appointments trying to find out what underlying immune system condition is responsible for all of her infection problems. Since that's begun, doctors have told her that she most likely has an immunodeficiency problem, and not an autoimmune problem. That's about as certain as we are right now. Just a few weeks ago, she had an endoscopy and colonoscopy to rule out H. pylori and we are waiting for those results.  

To my understanding, T's SVT is actually a congenital issue and the pericarditis just helped them discover it. Other than that, all of her issues, dating back to the initial mono that we had originally discarded, seem to be related to some underlying immunodeficiency disorder that we are currently trying to discover with the help of her immunologist, GI doctor, and other specialists and primary care.

# THE CURRENT ISSUE AND RELEVANT BACKGROUND

The concussion she suffered over 2 years ago is just a random weird blip in all of this. However, it has become the hardest thing to deal with. Now on to another part of my GF's medical history that feels important for me to provide. When she was near the end of high school, she had double hip surgery to resolve her snapping psoas syndrome. One surgery went really well and the other was, for a lack of better term, botched. She suffered with chronic pain for years, and still does though it has gotten better, and started seeing a pain management specialist. When we were 20, she started taking percocet for acute pain relief. Now I understand the red flag this sends up, but I cannot be more clear in how responsible T has always been with it. She hates taking it, and only does so when she has very severe spikes in pain, most often related to nerve damage or when she falls (part of the problem with the surgery was randomly losing support and falling). T has responsibly used percocet for years now and has never suffered from anything close to addiction and has maintained her connection with her pain management specialist the entire time.

However, percocet is a strong drug, and a source of friction in our relationship has been the way in which percocet makes her act. We call it ""funny."" For years, all through college, she would have to take a pill every once in a while. Sometimes she'd have to take it once a week, sometimes it'd be once a month. It varied. Whenever she did take one though, she'd become very ""funny."" Her pupils would get very small, she'd nod off, she was very energetic one moment then falling asleep the next. etc. All typical symptoms of percocet, as I understand it. I only tell you this because, from my point of view, her PCS symptoms are indistinguishable from the side-effects of percocet. She had her concussion, and was ""funny"" for months then she started to get back to normal but would be funny whenever there was too much stimulus (like having a conversation in the car while also listening to the radio, for example). 

Now I'll admit I have some things I need to work on when it comes to her being funny, but I can't help be bothered by her behavior whenever she is. Its been the cause of many fights for us because, to me, she's like a different person. She acts very differently and whenever she becomes funny, I get frustrated and end up just ""waiting for T to get back."" We've been in that sort of cycle for years now, and for a long time it was only because she had to take percocet every once in a while. She'd get funny, it would frustrate me how due to how differently she acted, but I knew she wasn't doing anything wrong so I felt doubly frustrated... It was almost like it would have been easier for me if she WAS an addict because then my frustration would be warranted... I would just be able be mad at her for misusing her prescription, but that's not what was happening. I don't mean to turn this into a counseling session for myself, I just want to breathe some context into why her PCS has become an issue for us.

Up until her concussion, T was only ever funny when she had to take pain medicine. I got much better at handling my irrational frustration with it and she had to take it less and less anyway. Then she had her concussion and we dealt with T being funny more often than I'd ever seen her for about a year. Then the concussion was resolved and her PCS symptoms faded away. We dealt with all of her other health issues that are detailed above in the meantime and that leads us to now/the past couple months. In the past couple months, T will get funny seemingly out of nowhere. She hasn't taken any pain medicine, she just comes home and is funny. She seems like someone who has taken percocet or is suffering from PCS symptoms, but she hasn't taken anything and her concussion was over two years ago... I'm very worried. I did some googling and found this: [https://www.passenpowell.com/new-study-post-concussion-syndrome-can-permanent/](https://www.passenpowell.com/new-study-post-concussion-syndrome-can-permanent/)

I know that it's just some random site but it's what prompted me to finally write all this out and just seek some input. T is randomly ""funny"" all the time now, without taking percocet. Our best guess is that she's just exhibiting extended PCS symptoms that have spiked because of... well I don't actually know. Maybe some of her medications mixing? Stress? This is what we want to get some clarity on, and she's currently trying to re-establish as a neurology patient. 

I don't want T to have these random bouts of ""funniness"" for the rest of her life. We've gotten much better at handling the behavior shifts that come with her being funny, but I think a large part of that is just because they happened less and less often. I've been hoping for years now that the cycle of normal T, funny T would end, but now I'm worried that it'll be a permanent part of our life. I'll post the TL:DR again below just to make my main concern as clear as possible. If you read all of this, thank you so much and any input at all is valued more than you know. We've had some bad luck with T's health, but it's honestly drawn us closer together. Just hoping this might help us gain some insight. Thanks again.

AskDocs,Unclear on Dysmenorrhea and implications,"I'm a 27 year old female and I have a history of painful, long, heavy, irregular periods starting when I was 14. I live in a rural area with one women's clinic and a few other hospitals and small clinics, but there really are not a lot of options for medical care. I have a primary care doctor that is great for a lot of things, but I go to the women's clinic for my Nexplanon implant. The only other medication I take is a 24 hour release 15 mg adderall.

I just had my Nexplanon replaced (this is my second now) about 4 months early because my periods came back in full force and I was miserable. The people at the women's clinic tried to talk me into an IUD, but I expressed that with my pelvic pain during periods, I'm unwilling to try something that is inserted, and Nexplanon did very well for me for the most part. They asked me a little about my symptoms and agreed that sticking to what I know works would be best for my dysmenorrhea. This is the first time I'd heard that word, and they clarified that it was just the word for ""painful periods."" I came home and did some digging, looking at the symptoms, and it does kind of fit the bill. Two things threw me off- I mentioned that during my period, my sciatic nerve pinches really badly, and my labia feel bruised and painful to the point of having to be careful how I sit. I didn't see anything about that anywhere, even after trying to research that specifically. I've talked to my primary care doctor about this as well, and we did hormone tests that came back relatively normal, and she kind of... discouraged me from being examined to look for endometriosis. Her reasoning is that its invasive, and since my birth control fixes the problem, it would be unnecessary. 

My doctor has been so great about other things, but after learning the term ""dysmenorrhea"" from another doctor I had seen one time and thinking about her discouraging me from further examination or testing, I'm really unsure about trusting her on this issue. Is she probably right and just sticking to birth control to manage my pain the right course of action? I don't want children, so this seems viable to me. On the other hand, could leaving the cause unknown exacerbate the problem without my knowledge and cause serious health issues down the line? The whole situation has me really confused about if I'm overreacting or not. I don't want to make the situation worse by trusting her, and I WANT to trust her, but I can't help but feel like it might be a mistake.",1,1,2020-06-22,full term birth

Cis female 

Weight: around 135

No diagnosed medical conditions 

Medication: Yaz


I’m on a combination birth control pill called Yaz, about six weeks into it. I decided to skip my period in the first packet by not taking the inactive pills. I started to have breakthrough bleeding (brown discharge) about ten days ago which was fine and expected but today I got a full period. Red, heavy flowing, serious cramping, the whole thing. I haven’t missed a pill. The closest to missing one I got was daylight savings time, which resulted in me taking my pills an hour later than normal. 

With my knowledge of the cycle and how it goes, in order for me to have a proper period I must have ovulated at some point, correct? Or am I potentially having a miscarriage? Should I go to a doctor? I do not have insurance so I only want to go if this is serious and I can’t find any decent information through google.

AskDocs,Been ill for last 6 years and doctors can't figure it out.,"15m. 155cm, 45kg, Don't drink, smoke, or take any drugs apart from antihistamines (for hayfever). Had a blood test for Vitamins and I’m all good nutrition wise. Pre existing conditions include: Asthma, Severe shellfish allergy.

One thing to note: Throughout all this my school grades have been pretty good, my cognitive ability in that respect seems to have held up.

Yo guys. Been to the doctor more times than I can count with no solid conclusion.

Context:

When I was 4y/o my health was in pristine condition apart from a bit of Asthma. However, I then suffered severe Gangrenous Appendicitis, where my Appendix had swollen so large it actually had pushed by Bladder, and other surrounding organs out of position before rupturing, with it then turning gangrenous. When Doctors asked for a urine sample, it felt like I was pissing a goddamn kidney stone. Doctors were saying I had hours to live. Luckily they were on the ball removing the Appendix, realigning my Bladder, and shoving copious amounts of antibiotics in me to get rid of the infection. Miraculously I pulled through. However, in the months to follow, while my digestive system was healing, I got hit with a series of Bladder infections one after another, which seemed frightening, however the period of time between new infections and old ones began to get increasingly large so I thought it was just part of the process. Soon I stopped getting infections at all and all seemed well.

Fast forward to 2014 when one night (which I remember vividly) I was just going to sleep when suddenly this intense feeling of dizziness washed over me. My bed felt like it was spinning out of control, and didn't feel like I was on earth. This ""effect"" lasted for about a solid 15 mins before going away, thinking it was a one off, I went back to sleep thinking nothing of it.

The next day was a different story. I was dropped off at school, and was walking to class when out of seemingly nowhere that same effect struck again. I quickly sat down on a bench as to not fall over. Then a new symptom appeared. My entire field of view began to seemingly shake side to side uncontrollably. It was terrifying. Like my eyes were out of my control. After about a minute of constant vision shaking, it finally stopped, along with the dizziness. This ""vision shaking"" seems to have not left me ever since then, it can happen while I'm on the toilet, in bed, walking, or playing games. It doesn't seem to matter what I'm doing, it just happens. Around a month later is when a rather difficult part of my life begins. I began to develop broken sleep, sometimes waking up at 1am and staying awake despite feeling tired or having a full sleep and feeling like shit afterwards. Then Nausea entered the scene. I began to just feel sick like I wanted to puke, while never actually puking, nor having diarrhoea or anything to actually indicate me being sick.

This Nausea continued for around half a year. Some days I'd be fine, others I'd sit at the dinner table and want to upchuck. My parents, worried with my decline, took me to the doctor, the doctor saying that it was nothing/just a phase. Then out of nowhere about 2 months later the nausea vanished. I was still left dizzy, with that ""Vision Shaking"", but hey I was improving. Then just as I mutter those words to myself, another bladder infection gets me out of nowhere. I go on antibiotics, and think of it as a one off.

The next year I get another Bladder infection, going on antibiotics solves the issue yet again. Then my nausea returns. I however refused it to get the better of me and tried to ignore and hide it. I would go to bed every night with a bucket under my bed just in case I actually did throw up (never did). The nausea becomes part of my sleeping pattern. I go to bed, try and sleep, wake up, and sit there begging to throw up, wanting it to go, sometimes crying myself to sleep. Just as if things couldn't get more shit my dizziness and ""Vision Shaking"" get considerably worse. One thing leads to another, and my parents pick up on what's happening and take me to the doctor. Yet again, I get told that it will go away.

The next year, things began to improve. My nausea improved a great deal (while still lingering) and my dizziness and ""Vision shaking"" got considerably better. Things seem to dissipate and I start feeling good again. A while passes when I relapse and begin to slip back to how things were. However new symptoms join the crew. Introducing a small stutter and slurring of words, as well as short term memory issues. I used to have such a sharp brain but 2018 did something to it. I feel sluggish, slow, and tired on top of the dizziness and “Vision Shaking”. I could get good sleep or awful sleep and feel the exact same kind of shit.

Fast forward to now, 2020, where more bizarre symptoms have appeared. Remember my bladder? Well now I’ve developed this thing where I feel extremely nauseous, like I’m about to puke, which then disappears completely when I urinate (doctors investigating) On top of that, my hands which never used to shake, have now started shaking. It’s most noticeable when I’m about to put the pen on the page or when I hold my phone. And now the 4 most recent symptoms: 1) While I’m sitting or lying down my legs while being relaxed and still suddenly jolt in one of the muscles around the knee or ankle. 2) This weird twitch in my right foot has appeared which, when it happens, feels like a small electrical current running from my ankle to my toes. 3) The most concerning one. I first noticed this when I was crossing the road. All I remember happening is walking along the street, (with no phone to look at) and suddenly realizing that I had crossed a road despite having no memory whatsoever. I literally was walking and thought, “Wait did I already cross that road?” and looked back to see that I had indeed crossed it without me having any recollection of doing it. On top of this I’ve been experiencing something that could be described as Memory Fog. I think about doing HW or something but then when I get down to do it, I forget what I was actually going to do. I know this happens to everyone, but this has been happening upwards of 10+ times a day. 4) My lymph nodes around my throat feel inflamed/swollen and can stay like that the entire day, making it uncomfortable to swallow.

So that’s me. If you have any ideas, feel free to tell me.

AskDocs,1 year old sudden loss of vision,"On Thursday, my 15 month old’s babysitter noticed that she wasn’t making eye contact like normal. At home, I noticed the same thing. Normally, if I look at her and smile she smiles back. But it looked like she was looking right past me. Along with that, she was not tracking objects with her eyes.

I took her to the pediatrician on Friday who was concerned and wanted her to see an ophthalmologist right away. So we did that, she had a full eye exam with her eyes dilated and there was nothing wrong (like far sightedness or strabismus etc) with her eyes. The ophthalmologist was concerned too and called a neurologist who wanted us to go to the ER so we could be admitted into neurology over the weekend.

The ER did a lot of blood work, a spinal tap for fluid (I can’t remember the name- I’m sorry.) and the doctors there just generally said they were stumped.

We are on day 2 of being in the pediatric neurology unit. She’s having an EEG done for 24 hours and hopefully an MRI today. The neurologist says he’s fairly confident she isn’t having seizures but wants to cover everything.

I hope one or both of those things gives us an answer but in the mean time all I have to do is think. What could possibly have caused this loss of vision seemingly overnight? She responds to sounds but not objects. She’s had hundreds of lights (from nurses doctors etc) flashed right in her eyes and she does nothing like you’d expect. They shined a light in my eyes to show me how abnormal it was that she did nothing because I instinctively moved my eyes.

Also... no falls, no high fevers, no recent illness, her birth was normal, she’s developmentally normal.

Does anyone have any idea of what this could be?",588,111,2020-09-06,full term birth
AskDocs,Sepsis right after birth - but what caused it?,"I gave birth to my lovely daughter almost a year ago and ended up in the ICU with sepsis within hours of delivery. We're in the US (Colorado). We still don’t actually know what happened and as we think about trying to have another baby not too long from now, I worry about it happening again and wish we knew what actually caused it. Just posting in case there happens to be a Dr. Gregory House hanging out here, I guess - ha. 

I had a normal, healthy pregnancy. I was 33 when I got pregnant and 34 at delivery, I'm a white American, and don't have any health issues. I am 5’6” and was 114 lbs, gained 37 lbs in pregnancy and lost 27 of that within a week (and the rest quickly after). I noticed I started getting slightly elevated BP readings late in pregnancy (like 120s over 70s when it had been 100s over 60s before), but nothing over medical threshold. 

I induced the day after my due date just because I wanted to. Before I actually went into labor, I had 2 borderline high BP readings (140/80), protein in my urine but at the lowest possible threshold to diagnose me with pre-eclampsia, which they did, while I was in the hospital for my induction. I also was running at a little over 99 F when admitted despite not feeling sick, which is an unusually high temp for me. Labored 18 hours, water broke on its own, got an epidural, pushed 3 hours, vaginal delivery 7 hours after water breaking. Felt exhausted but wonderful immediately after, but they had a hard time getting out my placenta. It took a full half hour and when we got it out, my midwife held it up incredulously and said it was the biggest placenta she’d ever seen and I could feed triplets with it. Then things went badly almost immediately. I started shivering uncontrollably, even after they piled me with warm blankets, and I was shaking/shivering so violently they couldn’t stitch me up. I spiked a fever to 103 F. My heart rate was 150 bpm. I went from having a nice post-birth glow to looking pale and like death. They drew blood and my lactic acid was 9 so they told me I was septic and rushed me to the ICU. They pumped me full of antibiotics and fluids and lactic acid was down to 2 in a few hours. I got a blood transfusion. I was there for the first day of my daughter’s life, but luckily she was as healthy as could be, 8 lbs 5 oz with a 9 on her Apgar and no sign of infection (they did constant blood draws of her, and at first they thought she had a slightly elevated white blood cell count but ended up fine and not treated with antibiotics). They did ultrasounds of my heart and uterus and everything looked okay. I was discharged to the mom & baby unit the next day. 

My midwife, OB, and ICU doctor were basically at a loss. They decided to go with endometritis just because that’s the most common cause of postpartum sepsis, even though it didn’t make sense: I never had any pelvic/abdominal tenderness, pain, or swelling at all in the hours/days after birth, no odor, no pain when peeing, no placenta left behind, my uterus shrank back down quickly, vaginal delivery, my water broke on its own about 7 hours before birth, no meconium. And the baby who had been inside my uterus had no infection. My midwife expressed skepticism at the endometritis diagnosis.

What do you all think happened? Is it really possible it was endometritis even without any of the symptoms? Why would my fever, heart rate, etc. spike so immediately after birthing the placenta when I was feeling fine right before? Did the placenta being abnormally large have anything to do with it? Or the fact that I lost almost all of my pregnancy weight so quickly after birth? What about the low-grade fever I had upon admission? And was the pre-eclampsia diagnosis just a coincidence? I just get a little nervous about the fact that we don’t know what caused it, because that means it’s hard to do anything different to prevent it next time and I really don’t want it to happen again.

I’ll get straight to the point: I’m a 27 Y/O female and I had a transvaginal ultrasound recently. I need help deciphering the results and figuring out what may be going on. 

[Skip-able side note: I’m not entirely medically illiterate as I used to be an EMT, but this is beyond me. My anxiety is so high... I’m not exaggerating when I say that this is keeping me up every single night, just brainstorming what it may be. I’m not particularly afraid of having cancer or anything, I just can’t stop thinking about what it MIGHT be. It’s so frustrating. My next appointment is not until in December.]

History, presentation, and labs follow the ultrasound results. 

“Measurements: The uterus measures: 10.5 x 4.4 x 5.5 cm. Right ovary measures: 3.3 x 2.8 x 2.6 cm; 13 cc. Left ovary measures: 4.0 x 3.4 x 2.2 cm; 16 cc. Endometrium: 8 mm.

FINDINGS: Transabdominal findings: Transabdominal images are limited. Endovaginal findings: Uterus: The uterus is heterogeneous. There is no focal endometrial lesion. Endometrium: The endometrial stripe is heterogeneous and mildly prominent at 8 mm. There are tiny cystic foci identified within the endometrium measuring up to 3 mm maximally. Adnexa: There is no adnexal mass. Flow is seen within each ovary without secondary signs of torsion. Multiple follicles are seen within both the left and the right ovary. Clinical correlation is advised. Given the configuration, correlation with possible polycystic ovarian syndrome is recommended. Fluid: There is no free fluid.

IMPRESSION: POSSIBLE POLYCYSTIC OVARIES. PROMINENT ENDOMETRIUM WITH TINY CYSTIC FOCI. NO WORRISOME ADNEXAL MASS. OTHER FINDINGS AS ABOVE.”


My current issue, condensed: irregular menses, infertility, abdominal and pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding
Long version: SO & I have been trying to conceive since the removal of my IUD 9 months ago, my cycles came regularly for a while although they were anovulatory, until I had 8 straight weeks of heavy menstruation beginning first week of September. I explained this to my new OB-GYN in October, who ordered the ultrasound. Follow-up for endometrial biopsy was scheduled at the same time as the ultrasound, but it’s not until December. 

Relevant medical history: polycystic ovaries, endometriosis (surgically confirmed), 3 live vaginal deliveries, 1 first trimester miscarriage, hypothyroidism, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, chronic high WBC, and family history of breast, lung, and brain cancer

Relevant surgical history: right ovarian cystectomy laparotomy in 2010, post-partum retention of placenta requiring a D&C in 2014, cholecystectomy in 2014, post-partum exploratory laparotomy for diagnosis of endometriosis and abdominal adhesions in 2019

Lab results, condensed: WBC high (11.5), neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes are borderline high, calculated osmolality is low (274), FSH 5.2, LH 18, prolactin 6.8, testosterone serum 44, TSH 1.010, T3 122.3, T-4 0.9, HcG < 1, DHEA sulfate 171.0, 17-OH progesterone 96, EGFR 94

So, Dr. Google and late night anxiety has suggested endometrial hyperplasia and uterine cancer, so that’s what I’m prepared for, but obviously I’m hoping it’s not. I’m driving my SO crazy staying up all night, so he suggested I turn to Reddit. 

The only thing worse than having a period for 2 months straight and every other week since is laying in bed at night wondering what the hell a heterogeneous endometrium is and what cystic foci are...

AskDocs,Are medications intended to be administered via intramuscular injection ineffective if not injected deep enough?,"23F, 169cm, 105lbs, biracial

I've been taking a prescription as an intramuscular injection for a few years and I didn't have any trouble at first, but I lost a lot of weight in that time which has made injections difficult. Generally I use a 1"" needle, though I can no longer get the full needle in without causing significant pain. Recently when I bought needles I bought some that are 1.5"" long. It's hard to tell, but I try to get the needle at least one third of the way in. Since losing weight I have often had issues with some of the medicine I inject coming out of the injection site before I get a bandage on and I have had bleeding from the injection site nearly every time.

I decided tonight to look into whether I might not be doing my injections deep enough, but I couldn't find much information other than that an average person needs a 1"" needle and that women have thicker skin than men in most areas of the body. While I was looking up information I saw something that said tingling, draining, and warmth at the injection site are all reasons for a person to call a doctor immediately, but those are common side effects for me. I'm a bit confused about that. 

I'm planning to switch to a different method of delivery for this medication next time I need a refill since I've been having issues with anxiety surrounding injections lately, but I want to know if I'm doing it right because I will likely return to doing injections in the future when my mental health improves.

What I'm most worried about is how deep I'm actually supposed to insert the needle since I'm significantly underweight and whether my medication has likely been less effective if I have not been injecting it deep enough. I did read that muscle tissue can hold more fluid than subcutaneous tissue which I believe should help clear this up. I take 1ml of this medication weekly. The medication is suspended in either safflower oil or sesame oil (sometimes the pharmacy switches, I'm sure that doesn't matter) with benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate. Each milliliter contain 10mg of the medication. Since I have been having anxiety issues I've been paying more attention to how much of the medication I have injected while I'm doing the injection. I've noticed that pain from the injection generally starts when I reach around 0.5ml injected. I never really thought of it before, but I imagine the pain might be a result of overfilling the tissue I'm injecting into. I did read that arm muscles, due to being smaller, can generally hold up to 1ml of medicine, so I assume that if I were injecting into my thigh muscle, as I'm supposed to, and not the subcutaneous tissue that I would be able to inject a full dose without significant discomfort like I used to. I don't know that for certain though. I do fit into size 00 pants, so I probably can't base my expectations on what an average person could expect.

If anybody has any insight which might help me do my remaining injections better I would really appreciate it.",11,5,2020-11-02,late delivery
AskDocs,"Short limbs on ultrasound, 38 weeks pregnant","My baby has been breech since around 32 weeks, but I’ve otherwise had an uneventful pregnancy. 

I am scheduled for a c-section tomorrow at 39 weeks and had a growth scan yesterday at 38+5 to check positioning and size before delivery. This was my first ultrasound since the anatomy scan at 20 weeks. I was told after my anatomy scan that everything was looking good and on track, but given no specific measurements. 

At my growth scan yesterday, I noted when she measured baby’s femur that it was showing on screen at 33 weeks + some number of days. The humerus also seemed to be measuring around 33 weeks. Head and abdomen measuring about 40 weeks. All of these values I read off the screen as she was measuring, I wasn’t provided with this info by the tech or anything. The tech did tell me that his estimated weight is 7lb 1oz and sent me on my way. 

I (of course) googled the femurs measuring so far behind and got results such as Down’s Syndrome and various forms of dwarfism. Cue me freaking out for the next 12 hours. 

I had my follow up appointment this morning and mentioned my concerns to my doctor regarding the femur and humerus lengths, and she said that they are measuring behind (again I wasn’t given exact values/percentiles/what GA they were measuring), but didn’t give me much indication what this means either way. She did say that if this had been seen at 30 weeks, for example, she may have referred me to MFM for more scans and genetic counseling if I would’ve wanted it, but that since we’re so close to delivering, it will be easier to assess baby once he’s here. 

She did say that she looked back at my anatomy scan and his femurs were 20-30th percentile then, and asked my height and my fiancé’s height. I’m 5’4”, he’s 5’7”. She suggested he could just be a short baby (although if he’s truly off by 5 weeks, that seems more significant to me than just being short) and that scans this late aren’t always accurate and his breech positioning may have played a role in this. She didn’t comment on other possibilities such as DS or dwarfism, just said we’d see him tomorrow and look him over. 

Can anyone speak to the level of concern I should have for a chromosomal or skeletal abnormality for our baby?

I need help understanding her blood work and if possible the stage of liver cirrhosis we are dealing with. Blood work details are listed below second paragraph, medical history following that.*

&#x200B;

My mom (70F, H=154cm, W=83kg, caucasian, Croatia), has alcoholic liver cirrhosis and she got turned down for hip replacement surgery -- twice in a little over a year -- due to her blood work and hepatic state. As per hospital release document they want her to ""improve her hepatic state, abstinence from alcohol is required in order to proceed with hip replacement surgery"".

I have an appointment with her family doctor at the end of next week to discuss further steps and treatments. As her caregiver I am a little frazzled and impatient to wait until the end of next week for any information. I would really appreciate any help with interpreting her blood work and understanding what her current state is and what I might expect next.

***My mom's health history & other existing medical conditions*** *(not sure what would be relevant so I listed all I can recall):*

* smoked 10 cigarettes a day until 2007
* problems with alcohol dependence since her 30's, with sobriety periods of up to 6 months in some earlier years. Increased alcohol consumption as of 2006.
* has hypertension since 2008 and has been taking therapy for that
* diagnosed with liver fibrosis due to alcohol in 2010 (at that time stage 2 I believe). They had her on K vitamin (?) and Silymarin, she still takes Silymarin.
* hospitalized with jaundice twice (2012 & 2013)
* hospitalized with encephalopathy (early 2014) and ascites (late 2014).
* crushed her ankle (18 screws put in) and collar bone while intoxicated (2016)
* problems with joints started increasing around 2018, placed on the waiting list for left hip replacement surgery due to two cysts. Started using a walking stick.
* hit by a slow moving vehicle in November of 2019, submitted to ER and had emergency surgery to reconstruct her elbow. Unfortunately, she was hit on her left side and this further impaired her walking and increased her hip pain. No hip fractures occurred. She has been in a sitting / lying position with very little movement since November of 2019.
* had edema in her lower extremities on several occasions since her liver fibrosis diagnosis. Currently present for about 4 months, she attributes this to sitting a lot.
* increased foot deformity in the last few years, but not the charcot foot. She has emphasized gouts and overlapping toes, random wounds that heal slowly and infect quickly.
* has been experiencing some confusion, forgetfulness and behavioral changes (anger, depression) on and off since 2014, I noted these occurring when her alcohol intake increases.
* In absence of alcohol she displays clear withdrawal symptoms since 2008
* important to note: although she has difficulties walking more than a few meters, she recently discovered home delivery and orders alcohol when others refuse to get her some. There's no stopping her, she refuses any type of treatment / help and denies ever drinking.

AskDocs,Unexplained hypoglycemia in postpartum Leiden factor V female,"A family member (35 yo F) has been having issues with unexplained hypoglycemia.  Currently 4 months postpartum.  During pregnancy was diagnosed as gestational diabetic (the most compliant diabetic you've ever seen).  She threw a nasty superior messenteric venous thrombus almost immediately after delivery which was fun and led us to the heterozygous Leiden diagnosis. She is back to her pre pregnancy weight (or darn close) at 125 lbs.

About a month ago she starts having bouts of hypoglycemia that occur late morning or early afternoon and happen almost every day.  We tried dietary changes with no results.  Contacted her ob who got her a 2 hour glucose tolerance test.  First hour was fine, second hour results: 22 followed with slurred speech and a small car accident.

We've been working for a month to get her into an endocrinologist but it's going to be at least another month so i figured I'd ask here for ideas on what this could possibly be.  Primary care is useless as he tried to start her on metformin which is contraindicated with Coumadin.

Last thing to add, I've never seen any of her finger sticks showing hyperglycemia and she's on Coumadin for the clotting disorder.  Also had two family members die of pancreatic cancer 2 generations ago (this is what I'm really scared about)

My questions are ;  how long is too long to have a full bladder that is unable to be emptied? Due to my pelvic floor difficulties the next time this happens should I avoid straining at all and go straight to emergency?   Will my cervix being at the opening put me on dreaded bed rest?

medical history- 3 pregnancies, all vaginal deliveries 


In late February/early March my entire family got really sick.
Nasty cough, fever, fatigue. My eldest child needed to go to urgent care because he had hallucinations from low oxygen, he tested negative for the flu. Every time I took a breath it felt like it was restricted. Every time I blew my nose there was a small tinge of blood. I was exhausted just walking room to room. I don't have insurance and tend to ignore medical issues as it is, I wasn't near death so I didn't seek medical help, just waited for it to pass, after a few weeks it did.
Also around this time all the skin peeled off the bottom of our toes. And my hair began falling out in handfuls. 

Now it's 6 months later and within these 6 months life has been stressful as all hell what with lockdowns and lost jobs and everything else going on. So I've been ignoring the things I've been experiencing and attributing them to the stress.

Over these 6 months I have still had bouts of extreme fatigue. My hair has not stopped falling out, every time I comb it handfuls come out. I have blatantly obvious bald spots at these point and I get sharp pains in my chest. I began to find it hard to think and remember things, and stumble over my words a lot when talking.

I have recently read that these are symptoms common in some people who have had Covid and I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do about them.
I recently began taking collagen to hopefully help with the hair loss. But will it even help if its post covid symptoms? 
How long will this last... it's been going on for half a year already?

I should have health insurance in the next month or so, is this even worth bringing up to a doctor.
Last time I took my oldest to urgent care I asked about an antibody test and the doctor agreed it sounded like we had covid, but said an antibody test wouldn't be reliable as it had been over 3 months.

I'm a 37 year old female - 5'9/145 lbs, former D1 collegiate athlete - not terribly actively lately due to busy work schedule - but completely ""fit"" by BMI/aesthetic purposes. 5 years ago...i slowly developed an increased propensity to sweating, whenever i'd perform a mild activity - that wouldnt make others sweat. For instance - a ping pong game with friends, or running out to the mailbox...it started getting progressively worse, exponentially - to the point, this past winter - I would have to carry my coat in below freezing weather on my walk to the train in the morning - because if i wore my coat, by the time i got on the train, id be so flushed...and worse, soaking and dripping with sweat from my head down my face that it would horrify others so bad, i'd have to get off the train. My job used to be face to face meetings with clients each week - and i had to stop, because even walking from my building, to the car, parking, and walking up to a new office, would send me into a soaking wet overheated mess. 

When this happens - my entire body sweats (not just armpits feet palms)...and its not just sweat - im burning up from within, as if i'd just run a marathon. It usually subsides within 5 minutes - though im soaking wet - often then freeezing cold as now the air conditioning or winter air is meeting my sweaty body. 

Last winter i proactively went to GP to get overall tests on blood/urine/general health levels...and everything came up almost alarmingly perfect. The GP put me on mild dose of benztropine - aimed to illicit the side effect it produces at higher levels in parkinsons patients ... though (1 i didnt stop sweating and 2) i couldnt handle the ""hangover"" feel. 

Its gotten so terrible, that i had to lay in front of my fan for 20 minutes after walking down 2 flights of stairs to pick up a delivery order. Definitely stopped socializing (before Covid) in recent months...even friends and coworkers that understand and non judgemental - its just the discomfort. 

Non Smoker. Eat healthy.

Age: 25  
Sex: Male  
Weight: 135 lbs  
Height: 5' 6""  
Smoking: Occasional cannabis vaping / smoking, occasional THC edibles, occasional CBD tinctures

So my life has been really stressful lately and I've had this lip issue for the past several months it just feels and looks inflamed.

I *(much ashamed of this)* more than often forget to brush my teeth at night because I am EXHAUSTED due to work (I am a delivery driver), which is what I'm guessing is contributing this lip condition. I am also on the road a lot so it's very difficult to find healthy things to eat on the job. I eat a very healthy overnight oatmeal in the morning \[organic rolled oats, Oatly Oatmilk, Organic Chia seeds, cinnamon, honey, yogurt, blueberries, mangoes, strawberries\]) but often find myself feeling hungry again during lunch time and resorting to high sodium jerky, chips, and tacos. Are there any lunches I can meal prep for myself that'll get that **\*tasty\*** craving I always crave and is healthy at the same time?

Will simply eating a better diet and brushing & flossing my teeth every night from this forth on fix my problem over time? Has anyone experienced this lip problem before? 

I also believe a Gastroenterologist diagnosed me with Irritable Bowel Syndrome around 8 months ago? Is the inflammation on my lips correlated with my gut health? I always feel discomfort in my intestinal areas and more than often go through diarrhea and I don't know why. I also suffer from pencil stools sometimes :( (but sometimes my poops are extremely light brown and healthy \[on days that I am not stressed\])

I am ready and happy to push the boat out on a new double electric breast pump as I want to breastfeed if I can and I want to give myself the best chance of succeeding. Black Friday would be a good time to commit.

BUT would you advise waiting? Maybe I won't be able to breastfeed anyway? Should I see how I get on in NICU with their pumps first? Maybe my babe by some incredible luck won't arrive early?

NICUParents,"3 weeks in the NICU, born at 28+3. Worried about growth trajectory","My son was born through spontaneous preterm labor 3 weeks ago on 8/26 at 28+3.  He's very healthy as far as being premature goes, and was at 2 lb 9 oz when and 15 inches when he was born.  He finally started climbing above his birth weight about 10 days in, and is now at 3 lb 1 oz, but is struggling with episodes of apnea.

&#x200B;

I am a bit concerned about his growth though - over the last 3 weeks he gets measured on length and head circumference every Sunday, but his head circumference has only gone up 1 cm from 26 to 27 cm, and his length has gone from 37 to 38 cm, which is still at 15 inches.

&#x200B;

I checked my pregnancy app and at his gestational age of 31 weeks, a typical fetus is nearly 17 inches and 3.75 lbs...  I know he has to lose weight when first born, but I'm just worried he's not growing much and when he will be able to catch up.  Does anyone have experience with this?

Due to the COVID virus only one parent can be in the NICU with the baby at a time. My husband and I are going to do our best to trade-off shifts. 

My original diaper bag is obviously a joke now as that’s for a newborn baby. What did you all have in your bags that you kept with you at the NICU? Breast pump supplies, notebook for doctor notes, cellphone chargers, and books to read to the baby seem like a given. What else would you all recommend?",5,11,2020-07-13,preterm birth
NICUParents,Not coping well and feeling guilty about it,"Just a vent - have no one really to sound off on. I’m one of the first in my friend groups to have a baby, and the ones who did had perfect pregnancies and no complications with their delivery. And my husband is doing so well with handling everything, I wish I could do the same.

But as the title says. Baby was born at 32+2. Pregnancy was going well until 23+5 when I was diagnosed with a short cervix (7-8 mm) after two weeks of cramping. Was hospitalized twice due to concern for preterm labor.

I remember telling my husband that we needed to be prepared to have a preemie. I joined this subreddit around then. Told myself I’d be happy if we made it to 32 weeks. But after those two hospitalizations things were going fairly well. No more cramping/contractions and I was secretly hoping we’d “make it”.

Diagnosed with IUGR at 28 weeks and hospitalized again at 30 weeks after fainting and him having multiple decelerations on the NST when I went in. Started having twice weekly BPPs and dopplers were a little funky but nothing bad, just weird. And his BPPs were always great and he moved a ton.

Anyway long story short had an emergency CS at 32+2 that was quite traumatic. And he’s been doing quite well since then. He was intubated briefly then on CPAP for 2 days. Now we’re at day 10 in the NICU and I’m so over it. I’m tired of leaving my son in the hospital. I hate seeing the NG in him. The leads. Part of me doesn’t want to go see him anymore because it hurts so much just seeing him there and of course leaving is the worse. But when I’m not at the hospital by his side I feel so anxious and can’t focus on anything else really. 

But I feel so guilty. Because he’s doing great and I know all things considered he could be worse off. Like this is only day 10. What about the micropreemies who are on ventilators for a long time? Or the term babies who need surgeries. He literally just needs to learn how to eat. So I feel super guilty that we “have it good” so to speak and I can’t be grateful that he’s doing well. 

And my husband is so level headed about it, but sometimes I feel like he’s minimizing my experience/feelings by saying “oh he’s doing well” or “oh he’s being cared for by experts”.

And to make it worse my maternity leave started and I don’t even have a baby at home. And by the time he is home it will be at least half over. But again feel guilty because some people don’t even get a maternity leave. 

I guess this is just a dilemma of allowing myself to feel sad even though “it could be worse”. I know it gets better but I’m feeling so impatient.",8,10,2020-08-03,preterm birth
NICUParents,I hope you find comfort in this. From an ex preemie.,"Hi, I’m a micropreemie survivor from 1998. I want to give parents some kinda image of a potential future, some hint of hope, for their children. I see many posts about survivors of preterm birth, but nothing about adults, so it occurred to me that in this awful year, I could do something good. 

I was born in 1998, at 24 weeks, weighing 1lb 5oz. When I was born, they thought I was dead. I had countless blood transfusions, bilateral grade 3 IVH (brain bleed), grade 3-4 are severe. Many times they tried to take me off of the ventilators so I could breathe, and I’d just end up crashing. My parents often walked in to them performing chest compressions. They told my parents that I’d be severely disabled, mentally retarded, unable to walk, talk, see or hear. They offered to take me off of life support. 

I’m here at 22 now, I have aspergers (which runs in my family) and ADD/anxiety (also genetic), and dyscalculia (maths dyslexia) That’s it. No movement issues at all, not even asthma. I’ve grown up around second hand smoke. Now, I know not every story is like mine, but the point is to never lose hope. In the eyes of the doctors, I shouldn’t be able to write any of this to you.

NICUParents,Second time NICU parent. Baby boy was born at 37w+1 but is not feeding well or regulating his temperature. I just want answers. Why is our full term baby not thriving?,"I had just unsubscribed from this subreddit, thinking I’d never be back here again. But here we are. I don’t feel scared, just devastated and confused.

My daughter’s birth was traumatic, and she suffered a brain injury due to lack of oxygen. She was cooled for 72 hours and stayed in the NICU for 14 days. I was in the ICU for the first 7 of those days recovering from severe sepsis (I had chorioamnionitis resulting from an appendectomy at 34 weeks). So my husband had to experience the worst of her NICU stay. By the time I was discharged and able to visit her, she was off oxygen and almost out of the warmer. 

Now it’s my turn to be the main NICU parent, and it is grueling. It started off with a big scare at the pediatrician on day 3 of his life. He was being seen due to having lost 10% of his body weight. They checked his glucose and it was extremely low, so we walked over to the nursery immediately and got him admitted. Right off the bat he needed oxygen and an IV and his body temp was 93. It was so scary to watch this all happening so quickly.

Now he’s on day 5 of his life and still feeding him is like a race against time, as his awake periods are so short and his stamina is almost nothing. The nurse said he’s acting like a much more premature baby, even though he was technically full term. 

They thought maybe he had an infection, but so far all the tests are coming back negative. I’m just so confused as to why my perfect boy isn’t able to wake up and have lots of big meals and get big and strong. I know it’s only day 5, and lots of babies take a week to start putting weight back on. But most babies don’t need this much help. 

So I’m worried he has a huge developmental delay. Our daughter is in special ed due to a delay, possibly caused by her birth injury. I always thought our son would be given an easier start and not have to go through therapies and services and would be able to just be “normal”. But now I don’t know.

Until it’s you spending weeks in a NICU smelling of anti septic soap…
Until it’s your baby's life in the balance and all you can do is pray and hope…
Until it’s you who can only touch your child through two holes in a big plastic box…
Until you've seen their feet, even too tiny for socks…
Until all this has happened because your health declined…
Until the sound of a NICU alarm makes you lose your mind…
Until this has been you do not judge our pain…
Until the anger and guilt has almost driven you insane…
Until it happens to you you'll just never know, how the wounds of preeclampsia/HELLP/HG/micro preemie birth may heal, but the scars will always show.

NICUParents,What size clothes for discharge day?,"Edit for anyone who has the same question- baby come home at 6lbs 10oz and was very much in preemie size. He stayed in preemie for about a month.

My LO is now 31 weeks old (2 lbs 12 oz!) and I was wondering what size clothes he will be in by the time he is allowed to come home. Would he be sent home if he is still preemie size? Newborn? One of the nurses mentioned once the babies start tolerating feeds they bulk up quickly so maybe even 0-3? I know every baby is a bit different but was looking for everyone else’s experiences.",2,8,2020-11-02,premature birth
NICUParents,2 weeks in the NiCU,"I was nervous to post about her because I was worried things would change but It’s been two weeks and 1 day since little Naomi has come into this world. She just turned 26 weeks. It’s been exactly as many of you told me it would be. A rollercoaster of up an downs.

From the time she was born, she only weighed 1 lb 3 oz. immediately the team of NICU doctors rushed her away. I watched desperately as she was hooked up to many cables and machines to get her body stable. Even though it felt like eternity, 25 mins had gone by and she was stable. The doctor let me cut the cord and soon we were headed to a room set aside for her to start this journey. 

In the first few days, she was on a ventilator with the lowest settings. Coupled that with other lines for iv, blood, etc, everything just terrified me. I watched and waited for hours while my wife was in recovery from her c-section. I couldn’t believe how small Naomi was. I just hoped that she would be okay for just one more hour and every time that happened, I would say “ok now one more hour” i didn’t sleep at all that night and I remember just getting up at 2 am just to go visit. 

Day 2 really started to hit home about what happened. She was here and many of the doctors and nurses explained to us things like terminology, what the machines do, how she might respond, everything that we needed to kind wrap our heads around since she was so premature. At the end of it, I received a book from the hospital about preemies. Thinking back, the information from it really helped me calm down since I could at least start to expect what could happen.  

From that point on, Naomi really began to shine. She was responding well to everything. Pooping great, breathing fine. Doctors did a head ultrasound on day 3 and day 14 and both came up good. No brain bleeds. By day 5 my little Naomi got off the ventilator and has been on bubbles since. She had her moments, some Brady’s here and there which she would break out of herself. Desats as well.  It wasn’t all prefect though. Her breathing has fallen somewhat, she used to be around the 26-30 percent oxygen but now she’s been as high as 46 percent. We hope that as time continues to pass, her lungs will do better. She had an infection too, which the doctors immediately caught and got her on the right antibiotics which saved the hassle of having to remove the picc line early. Her sugars too have been erratic. From 160 to highs of 300. Doctors put her on insulin drips and only today has she been off for a few hours with sugars around 170. Her weight was another issue, losing those precious grams scared the wife and I. Even though it’s normal it really got to us that our small little one could get even smaller. Eventually she began to bounce back and with her full feedings, she’s 560 grams now, maybe even more when they weigh her tonight. Lastly, she has had 2 blood transfusions and maybe a third coming as well since her nurses do a lot of blood gasses to track her levels. 

 I apologize for the wall here of text, but I just wanted to share this little bit of light that I have with each of you. Naomi has really healed a bit of me in the time she’s been here. As always I cross my fingers for one more hour with my little one. I hope each of you here have all the positivity in the world if you are in the NiCU as well.",29,7,2020-07-22,premature birth
NICUParents,New NICU mom,"After a healthy pregnancy and giving birth on my due date, I am now a NICU mom. A somewhat traumatic birth, that ended up with my baby girl having birth asphyxiation and a many complications to come with it. She had to be resuscitated when she arrived in the NICU. They told us she most likely wouldn’t make it. 

It has now been a week and she is still fighting. She has a brain enema, but the swelling has gone down. She completed hypothermia treatment. She also had a bleed in her liver that has now stopped, but does have a pulmonary bleed that they are treating with different medicines. She originally could not void, but is now pooping and urinating on her own, though she is not urinating as much as she should. She is on a ventilator and sedated. They said her brain and heart function is really good though.

This past week has been really rough. I only have my husband for any support in person as we live in a different country than our families and friends. There is a communication barrier between us and doctors and nurses since the translator isn’t always available. We also can only see her for 5 minutes every once in awhile due to COVID. 

I am struggling because I don’t know many people with kids who have been in the NICU. The few who have been has been due to their children being premature. She is also still considered in critical condition so I am unsure how to feel. 

If you read this far, thank you. I just needed to write all of this out.",11,7,2020-08-31,premature birth
NICUParents,UPDATE POST: Our IUGR Peanut,"Hello all,

Posted about 6 months ago that we found out about our little peanut's IUGR diagnosis at 24+6.

So, a quick rundown: wife went into full on preeclampsia 6 weeks later, BP peaked at 190/110 and she was admitted for the week prior to birth. Her condition reached critical mass and at the end of January, our little one made her grand entrance via emergency C-section, weighing in at only 1lb 14 oz.

Baby quickly established herself as top dog on the NICU, with everyone involved in her care remarking at how feisty and full of life she was, even at such a premature age.

We were absolutely thrilled to find out her growth restriction was ""asymmetric"" and that her brain and other vital organs were where they should be developmentally. In addition, none of the other abnormalities or deficiencies we had feared for based upon initial findings were present. Besides being tiny, she is perfectly healthy aside from a little reflux. We are immeasurably blessed.

After 83 grueling days, our little one came home. She's been home almost 3 months and is now over 10 lbs. She is still on the small side for her weight, but her development and milestones are in line with her age. She loves laughing, smiling, and playing with her toys. She has begun to find her voice and her stubborn personality continues to shine through. 😉

I haven't commented here much (only lurked) since that original post, but I'm thankful for all of the positivity and support here.

To the parents facing this now: you are strong and you are awesome, and so is your baby. Not everyone gets the unique privilege of being a NICU parent. This trial will be testing, but it will eventually end, and your baby WILL come home. I'm so proud to be a NICU dad, and the growth I experienced both personally and with my wife as a couple has been invaluable.

Stay strong. ✌",19,1,2020-07-09,premature birth
NICUParents,Needing alone time,"I'm 9 days past my emergency c-section at 28 weeks. Baby boy is doing reasonably well, and I'm recovering from the surgery ok. 

But I am feeling *extremely* anti-social, and I'm not sure how to deal with it. My husband went back to work today so I need to rely on people for rides for a while, but I am really dreading making conversation in the car. We've had people offer to bring food to the house, but I'm exhausted just by the thought of making small talk when they drop it off. The texts and calls from grandparents overwhelm me. I don't know how to talk to people about the actual delivery because it was so unexpected and frightening, and there's still quite a bit of it I don't understand myself (I have an OB appt tomorrow where I can ask a lot of questions). 

I'm conscientious of PPD and I don't think this is it-- my husband and I have moments of joy together, I'm eating normally, I look forward to going to the hospital to visit my son, etc. I just need a long break from the outside world. How long did it take you to feel ready to be (at least minimally) social again? In tbe meantime, how do I politely but firmly rebuff the well-wishers?",27,28,2020-08-18,early delivery
NICUParents,NICU bound,"My wife is 28+5 and we have been told our baby is in the 1st percentile, weighing in at around 800g, with no amniotic fluid as highlighted at the 28 weeks scan (scan on week 23 was fine).

We're scared now because blood flow is good so the consultants are entertaining possible genetic/chromosomal issues.

The challenge we have is running the risk of inducing early delivery (and everything that comes with that) by testing for chromosomal abnormalities via invasive methods. What do we do? It's such a difficult decision to make because if we found that the baby had serious conditions that would limit quality of life we would have a difficult decision to make. If we don't, we don't.

**Update 3rd December**: we got viral tests back to confirm they aren't the cause of the small size. Following that we made the decision to undergo the CVS test. This is going to be the longest 2 weeks of our lives!",22,21,2020-11-27,early delivery
NICUParents,23+0 Twin Girls,"It’s been a rollercoaster for the the past three weeks.  All started on my wife’s routine mfm visit and the sonogram tech noticed she was dilated 2-3cm.  Our mfm dr came in and said she wasn’t comfortable placing a cerclage herself and recommended bed rest but it was likely my wife would go into pre-term labor fairly soon.  We were immediately heartbroken, but another Dr in the group took a look and thought he could do it.  It took two tries but ultimately got it in and was happy and let us know that as long as there was no infection in the next two weeks or go into labor he thought it would hold much longer.  Over the next 2.5 weeks we were in and out of the hospital 3 times for various levels of bleeding and the only thing they could tell us was that the cerclage looked good, no infection, and they didn’t know for sure what the bleeding was but suspected some level of placental abruption.  Eventually she had a bad bleeding episode so they admitted her for observation.

The next few days were uneventful, a little bleeding that came and went, however, she woke up one night having severe cramps.  They tried calming it but ultimately did an exam and she was dilated 4-5cm and the dr said they had to remove the cerclage and she’d likely deliver at 22+6 very quickly after removal. This was early morning and after consulting with nicu they wouldn’t intervene.  I can’t even describe how much pain and loss we experienced after that news.  We cried in each other’s arms and eventually told the nurse we were ready to remove the cerclage and place an epidural. After that was done we were told it would happen quickly.  Well, it didn’t we waited around in the delivery room for another 12 hours grieving and saying goodbye and bursting into tears in and off, but the twins just didn’t want to budge.  My wife was dilated at 9.5cm for pretty much the full 12 hours and the nurse and dr on call both said they’d never seen anything like that before.  The around 7pm the dr consulted with nicu and the nicu dr on call came up and talked with us and said they would intervene based on our decision.  

Over the previous weeks we were struggling with what we would do if we had to make this choice between 23+0 and 23+6.  It ended up being the easiest decision of our lives.  They fought like hell to stay in my wife’s womb and easily decided they deserved every chance we could give them to survive outside.  After that it was a flurry of preparation and my wife got additional meds to help with their lungs and bleeding and eventually gave birth to our sweet baby girls 12hours later.  

I can’t bring to describe the joy of being given this chance for them even knowing everything is stacked against them in the comings days/weeks/months.  The nicu nurses and drs have so far been the kindest and sweetest people I’ve ever met and I know they’re in the best possible hands now.  I don’t know what will happen but I’m just so thankful that I’ll get to know them at least a little and let them know they are loved.

They’re both 2.5 days old and doing about as well as the drs could expect and just waiting to ride out this honeymoon phase so we know the bigger picture.",66,17,2020-06-03,early delivery

NICUParents,NICU/birth PTSD?,"Hi all. I am wondering if it is possible to get PTSD from a tramautic/early birth and nicu stay. A little info: I gave birth at 28+2 due to severe pre-eclampsia. There were complications during delivery and I was under general anesthesia. Baby had to be resuscitated but ultimately did OK. She spent 70 days in the nicu, all the while I was listening to alarms conserned about her breathing. Finally got her home two weeks ago. I'm obsessed with her breathing and always think she's going to stop. I have had a repeating nightmare that prevents me from sleeping. Basically the dream is that she is in the bed with me and I lose her in the blankets and she suffocates. I have woken up screaming. (FYI she sleeps in the crib or bassinet never in our bed). I'm wondering if this could be something serious like ptsd or ppd. Should I see a Healthcare professional? Any advice is welcome. Thanks.",15,15,2020-09-28,early delivery
NICUParents,Difficulty coping,"Hello, I’m new here. My little man was born on the 31st of July, 9 weeks early, due to severe polyhydramnios. He was finally discharged last week. My partner and I had issues with the nursing staff, and their ability to follow our care plan. We were blamed for what they called a communication break down, despite being there literally every day and constantly making our plan known. 

It got to the point where I was ready to have him transferred. And suddenly he’s ready for discharge two days later? Which I found highly suspicious, but we decided to keep him there instead of transferring, as he had been doing well and we figured we were ready to finally be done with the NICU.

Now my son is home and it’s hitting me hard just how unprepared I am. We didn’t spend much time practicing bottle feeding because I wanted to breastfeed. The lactation consultant never once mentioned that he was tongue tied and that all he was doing was essentially just chewing my nipple and nothing productive or nutritive, she said that he was doing good and just needed more practice. He was starved whenever I tried breastfeeding, and guzzling bottles down when feeding was left to the nurses, though none of this was communicated until I asked about doing the 72 hour, breastfeeding only period, the hospital was supposed to offer before a bottle was ever even offered.

He can’t sleep without a video I found of the NICU monitors playing. I can’t stand the video, I feel like I’m still just at his bedside back at the hospital, but he starts crying if I pause it, so it’s been playing 24/7. My partner can ignore the video playing in the background and doesn’t understand why it bothers me so much. 

I try to talk with my partner, but he just dismisses what I say, won’t accept that my pregnancy and care has been traumatic. All I hear is how the most important thing is that my son is home and healthy, and I agree. But why can’t I acknowledge that things were less then ideal and they were traumatic? Why can’t I mourn the loss of a normal pregnancy, a normal delivery, not getting to hold my son right away?",5,8,2020-10-04,early delivery
NICUParents,Advice for 2nd NICU go round?,"I'm 31 weeks with baby #2 and it's looking likely my preeclampsia will be recurrent given the way my blood pressure is trending. I had HELLP the first time around too, and delivered a daughter at 34+4 who is now a little older than two. Goal is induce at 37 weeks but idk if I'll make it that far. Mentally I'm hoping for 34 weeks at least like with baby #1 who only had a nine day nicu stay. Curious if anyone has advice for how to prepare/navigate a second NICU experience with a toddler at home. Covid also obviously complicates getting help after coming home, but we do have a part-time nanny already who will continue with us when #2 arrives. Feels less terrifying this time because of good NICU experience the first time, but I can't help wonder what I should be doing to ready our family for another likely preemie. Would greatly appreciate any advice you all have to offer.

Edit: since I first posted this I've been admitted to hospital. blood pressure. Waiting to see if I'll be released after four hours of observation/non stress test/lab results, or whether I'm staying through delivery. It's getting very real here.

NICUParents,We had an appointment today with the neonatologist at our NICU. Our baby has severe IUGR due to placental insufficiency. I thought I would share the questions we asked and the answers we were given incase it may help anyone else who is here preparing for a possible NICU stay.,"1. Gestational age VS gestational weight? Which is better as far as prognosis.

A: Gestational age is better, but low weight makes it more challenging. She doesn’t expect him to gain much more weight but she doesn’t really know. She has seen babies as small as 1 pound survive, she’s been a NICU doctor for 26 years. 

2. What would be a good goal weight/age to get to for the best prognosis?

A: A pound or a little more would be better than under a pound. 


3. What can we expect as far as ventilation, feedings, oxygen support, time in NICU, etc..?

A: Baby will likely need ventilation support, feedings will start very small and he will get a few drops of breast milk, if the feedings aren’t working they will switch him to intravenous feedings. Time in NICU will depend on how he is growing and any issues that arise and how well his lungs develop. 

4. What types of items would we need and which are provided? Clothes, formula, breast pumps, diapers, wipes? 

A: everything is provided, we can bring clothes when he gets a little bigger.

5. Are NICU babies in their own room like in an ICU or are they in a grouped area like in a nursery?

A: They are in pods of 3-4 babies

6. Are we allowed to stay? Are there visiting hours? Restrictions? 

A: Parents can visit 24/7, visitor restrictions due to Covid. 

7. If prognosis is very poor, he gets sicker than expected, and we feel complications will cause his quality of life to be very poor do we have the choice to end life saving measures in the NICU at any point? 

A: She was glad we asked this because it’s important to be realistic. They will do everything they can to help him but with any baby in the NICU there is a chance of something happening that would cause severe lifelong issues and poor quality of life, and if that happens then we as the parents have the right to end life saving measures. 

8. Are vaccines and the newborn screening for genetic issues such as sickle cell and cystic fibrosis still done on the same schedule as a full term baby? 

A: Vaccine schedule will be delayed but Newborn screening will occur on time, about 2-3 days after delivery.",83,22,2020-12-01,NICU stay

NICUParents,Question about maternity leave/FMLA for parents during extended NICU stays,"Hi all, I hope this is ok for me to post here. I am almost 25wks with B/G, di/di twins. Our girl twin was recently diagnosed with severe IUGR, around 1st percentile currently, and we are currently preparing ourselves for delivery some time in the next 4-7 weeks depending on how the next few weeks go.

My boss wanted me to reach out to HR about making sure my maternity leave/paperwork is taken care of and I started thinking....  I had initially planned to take the 6wks paid from my employer and then do an additional 6 weeks of FMLA to stay with the babies until about 12 weeks. However, now that we are facing an extended NICU stay, I am wondering how to configure this so I don't take a ton of leave while they are still in the NICU. I want to have time off of work when they come *home*, not while they are still in the hospital. 

How did all of you deal with this kind of situation and should I suggest anything to HR? I assume I would have to take my 6wks paid leave and then maybe I can take 6wks of FMLA leave whenever they actually get to come home, but I am new to all of this so I don't know if that's doable!

NICUParents,Cost of NICU stay and Insurance Coverage,"Hello everyone,

I know that this subreddit is for the support for the parents whose babies are in the NICU. Much strength to you guys who were going through tough times and I hope the situation gets better for everyone experiencing this.

We are having twins (MCDA) and the due date is in October. But I just wanted to prepare if we are anticipating few weeks of stay in the NICU. I am concerned mostly about the cost for the NICU stay and the insurance coverage. In general, how much will be the cost for the NICU stay per day and how much the insurance will be able to cover the cost. I talked to my insurance company (UHC) and they told me that there will be a charge of $500/day for the inpatient stay. And I am pretty sure we will hit our out of pocket max ($7.5k for individual and $15k for family) if we are staying in NICU even for atleast couple of weeks.

What will be the better option in terms of insurance and how can I prepare myself to financially manage if there is a NICU stay for few weeks/months?

NICUParents,Rant/sorry,"Edit 3: Y'all have been incredible and I am so appreciative of all of you. To those who were hurt by my post - I am so sorry. It was never my intention. In a moment of weakness, I lashed out, and I am so sorry you were caught in the crossfire. To those who offered a different perspective - thank you for reminding me that no experience is the same, and that ""uneventful"" does not mean ""perfect."" To those who sat with me in the frustration and let me know it was okay to feel that way - thank you for being real.

Edit 2: thank you, everyone, for the responses. I have learned a lot and I am grateful for this supportive community. A couple things: 1. This was in no way meant to devalue or invalidate or diminish anyone's experience, and as one person pointed out, a short stay is not the same as having no problems. 2. There are always going to be insensitive people in the world who try to do exactly that. 3. We are incredibly blessed to have a great relationship to begin with - any instances of frustration at others' experiences is kept between ourselves, and we would never DREAM of calling someone out or anything. I just wanted to know that I was not the only person feeling that frustration. 4. I am so glad I joined this group - y'all are all incredibly special and wonderful people and I look forward to gaining more wisdom and perspective from people like you.

I know that the NICU experience is different for everyone, and I'm not here to gatekeep who can be considered a ""NICU parent"" because that's not my call.

But does anyone else get really frustrated by the ""[single-digit] days in the NICU and we're finally going home"" posts? Like, yes, I get it, you went to have your baby early and expected to go home with your baby shortly thereafter, and then were disappointed when you had to wait a week - and that's tough. But like...

My little girl was born 15 weeks early. She won't be coming home for another couple of MONTHS. And I live an hour and a half away. Part of me wants to yell ""GET A GRIP, you're going home after days, try weeks or months and then come talk to me.""

Anyone else with long-term NICU stays get that kind of frustration? Again, I'm not trying to downplay anyone's experience - that's not my place. Nor am I calling any one particular person out about this. I'm just tired, y'all.

Edit 1: thank you for all of the responses. I've read all your comments, but sleepy brain (thanks pumping schedule) says wait till later to respond. I'll at least say this - y'all are all incredible.",35,116,2020-08-15,born early

A: Gestational age is better, but low weight makes it more challenging. She doesn’t expect him to gain much more weight but she doesn’t really know. She has seen babies as small as 1 pound survive, she’s been a NICU doctor for 26 years. 

2. What would be a good goal weight/age to get to for the best prognosis?

A: A pound or a little more would be better than under a pound. 


3. What can we expect as far as ventilation, feedings, oxygen support, time in NICU, etc..?

A: Baby will likely need ventilation support, feedings will start very small and he will get a few drops of breast milk, if the feedings aren’t working they will switch him to intravenous feedings. Time in NICU will depend on how he is growing and any issues that arise and how well his lungs develop. 

4. What types of items would we need and which are provided? Clothes, formula, breast pumps, diapers, wipes? 

A: everything is provided, we can bring clothes when he gets a little bigger.

5. Are NICU babies in their own room like in an ICU or are they in a grouped area like in a nursery?

A: They are in pods of 3-4 babies

6. Are we allowed to stay? Are there visiting hours? Restrictions? 

A: Parents can visit 24/7, visitor restrictions due to Covid. 

7. If prognosis is very poor, he gets sicker than expected, and we feel complications will cause his quality of life to be very poor do we have the choice to end life saving measures in the NICU at any point? 

A: She was glad we asked this because it’s important to be realistic. They will do everything they can to help him but with any baby in the NICU there is a chance of something happening that would cause severe lifelong issues and poor quality of life, and if that happens then we as the parents have the right to end life saving measures. 

8. Are vaccines and the newborn screening for genetic issues such as sickle cell and cystic fibrosis still done on the same schedule as a full term baby? 

A: Vaccine schedule will be delayed but Newborn screening will occur on time, about 2-3 days after delivery.",83,22,2020-12-01,gestational age
NICUParents,"3 weeks in the NICU, born at 28+3. Worried about growth trajectory","My son was born through spontaneous preterm labor 3 weeks ago on 8/26 at 28+3.  He's very healthy as far as being premature goes, and was at 2 lb 9 oz when and 15 inches when he was born.  He finally started climbing above his birth weight about 10 days in, and is now at 3 lb 1 oz, but is struggling with episodes of apnea.

&#x200B;

I am a bit concerned about his growth though - over the last 3 weeks he gets measured on length and head circumference every Sunday, but his head circumference has only gone up 1 cm from 26 to 27 cm, and his length has gone from 37 to 38 cm, which is still at 15 inches.

&#x200B;

I checked my pregnancy app and at his gestational age of 31 weeks, a typical fetus is nearly 17 inches and 3.75 lbs...  I know he has to lose weight when first born, but I'm just worried he's not growing much and when he will be able to catch up.  Does anyone have experience with this?  Or are NICU babies smaller than full term babies even at same adjusted age?  Do they only catch up when they become toddlers or later?",15,19,2020-09-17,gestational age
NICUParents,8 weeks into our NICU stay- need words of encouragement about feeding milestones,"FTM here. My baby was born at 30 weeks and 5 days. She’s now 38 and 5 days and hasn’t reached her feeding milestones yet. She’s small for gestational age (4 lb 5 ounces now), and has been amazing right from birth (coming off CPAP very soon, etc). Some days she does 60% PO and some 30% PO. The closer we get to the due date, the harder it has been for me. They are now talking about her anemia potentially being the issue for the reduced energy and stamina (they may transfuse if they see a big dip in a reading tomorrow) , and today they spoke about how many babies do go home with the gavage tube. It’s exhausting and i would love to hear from other NICU parents about their experiences on this front. Sorry for the verbal diarrhea. Really want her to be healthy and come home soon.",13,19,2020-06-25,gestational age
NICUParents,"At what age can I expect my baby to become more alert, awake, and responsive to his surroundings? Is this typical?","My baby was born at 28+4 weeks via emergency c-section due to severe early onset intrauterine growth restriction after heart decelerations were detected on the fetal monitor. He came out weighing 1lb 0.2oz and was 10 inches long. It was a placental issue, all chromosomal issues were ruled out. So far he’s had a few issues with his blood work, some jaundice, and had to be intubated for the first few days on low vent settings and low oxygen requirements. He has a PDA and some brady events where he desats but he recovers quickly with stimulation. Blood gases look good, no brain bleeds, no infections, and is gaining weight despite not quite tolerating full feeds yet and only his trophic feedings so far. 

My question is at what age did your baby finally become more alert and aware of your presence? My little guy is 3 weeks old today (almost 32 weeks CGA) and it seems like he just sleeps all the time. Even when he wakes up he opens his eyes and looks at me but doesn’t seem to acknowledge I’m there and it’s hard to even tell if he’s awake or just opening his eyes in his sleep. 

My other son was born at 37 weeks and came out very alert and wide awake, so only a 5 week age difference. 

Is this normal for micro preemie babies or could this be a sign that he has some degree of cognitive issues? When can I expect him to be more aware and acknowledge my presence? At what corrected gestational age did your baby cry regularly and want to be held?",8,11,2020-12-30,gestational age
NICUParents,Appropriate growth curves?,"What growth curves did your pediatrician follow after you left the NICU? Our pediatrician was tracking our 26 weeker on a normal full term baby curve based on his adjusted age and he was doing fine. Then today she showed us a different curve, one that is specific to premature babies born at various completed gestational months and his percentiles have suddenly increased. Basically the difference between the two is that this one tracks him against other preterm male babies. Technically he should be on a curve that starts at -3 months (born 3 months before due date), but the one she had started at -2 months. Presumably this curve merges with the full term baby curve at some point?",21,13,2020-06-08,gestational age
NICUParents,C-section for preeclampsia at 29 weeks,"Hi everyone, I'm currently 29 weeks, 5 days pregnant and hospitalized for preeclampsia. My blood pressure has been a little high and my liver values are trending upwards. It is looking like I will need to have a c-section in the next few days.

NICUParents,Reflux tips,"Hello, my little girl was born at 32 and is now 36 gestational age. From talking to the nurses and reading posts on this sub I think she struggles with reflux. She’s spit up a few times, but mainly she gets hiccups, grunts, distended belly, arches her back, and has oxygen saturation dips. She gets fortified breast milk and will be on Neosure when discharged. But I’ve read posts on this sub that lead me to believe those can aggravate a babies stomach. The doctors haven’t told me to try any dietary changes for my breast milk (like cut out diary). The doctors and nurses aren’t that concerned with her symptoms, but I hate to see her uncomfortable. Any tips for reducing reflux in the NICU and when she’s home?

I keep her upright for 30 minutes after feedings when I am there. The nurses put her bed up at an angle. They have advised against an angled pillow after discharge because of SIDS risk.",8,5,2020-11-17,gestational age
NICUParents,Cardiac surgery and feeding issues,"I know I post way too much here by now but I have a few feeding questions and any input would be greatly appreciated. I have a 43 week old (born at 39 weeks so technically not a preemie but small for gestational age) who recently had heart surgery a little over 3 weeks back. He has taken a good amount of formula and donor milk through a bottle before surgery but now he takes 99% of his feeds through the ng tube. I call and ask every day how his feeds are progressing but I have the feeling its just easier for the nurses to leave him on the ng feeds then it is to work with a fussy baby to take his feeds through a bottle but that really, really scares me because while he has made some progress in his feeding so far (he didn't used to be able to take bolus feeds but now he keeps them down) I'm worried I might have to take him home with either the ng tube or a gtube.

Its hard for me to be there for him because me and my husband share a car and he works most of the day but I'm going to try and stay longer to supervise his feeding and try the bottle feeding myself (He only takes just under 10 mls sadly) because I'm more willing to work through his fussiness because he's my child and I'm his only real advocate. I can't stand the thought of him lying there with an ng tube damaging his intestines knowing that if I were there maybe he would eat more. Every time I've held him so far he seemed to move closer to my breast, I know his ability to suck and swallow is there and I've even seen drink a bottle before with no issue. Can anyone give me advice on what to do? Techniques to try? What I should ask of the nurses? Will I have to accept the reality that he will need to come home with the tube?

&#x200B;

Am I allowed to try a bottle feed myself and will the nurses generally be ok with this or do they have a routine they never stray from and I have to get lucky with being there at the right time?",3,5,2020-07-23,gestational age
NICUParents,Fortifier woes!,"Can anyone give me your tips for getting your baby to take fortified milk that they don’t like?

Some backstory:

My 28-weeker came home a few weeks ago. We were told to fortify half his feeds (so, 4 bottles a day) to 24 calories. He had some weight loss in the NICU from being on IVs during an episode of bloody stools, so he’s still gaining “catch up” weight.

He’s got a dairy allergy, so we’re using Elecare. He hates it. He doesn’t like the taste, it makes him horrifically gassy, his poops are watery and stress him to the point of giving him bloody stool. We tried Alimentum, and he didn’t like that either.

We did a trial run with just nursing for five days, and he was like a different baby. Less gas, settling at night. But, he didn’t gain enough - only 3 ounces in 5 days. The doctor wants him to jump weight percentiles to catch up on a weight loss he had while still in the NICU.

We’ve tried feeding him in a bouncer seat to distract him a little, which seems to work the best. Anything else is an hour of spluttering, choking, crying, spitting, to get down *maybe* 40mL. We were told to try for 60 at a minimum per fortified feeding, but he just shuts down and won’t do it. Even if he’s hungry.

Any suggestions/tips? Editing to add, his current gestational age is 43 weeks. So I think he’s a little too young to try something like oatmeal, although the doctor suggested I could do that in another month.",4,3,2020-07-01,gestational age
NICUParents,What do dads do?,"We were pregnant with twins. Aparently my wife had developed an infection that jumped to her bloodstream and caused her water to break at 23w 2d. We lost our first girl as she didnt have enough time for the neonatal steroids and her cord had prolapse.

We eventually stopped labor long enough and got my wife stable for transport to a level 4 NICU and the best hospital in the state. 

Wife was admitted to ICU and told ""you've got to give birth to treat sepsis or we could lose you both.""

Our girl was born going on 5 days ago at 23w 5d at 1lb 6oz (8 oz bigger than they expected) and has been extremely stable, on 26% oxygen, and when she is sedated her vitals never drop.

My question is, what do I do? My wife can pump, send colostrum, put her scent on a snoodle (little quilt thing for NICU babies) but all I feel I can do is wait and wash pump equipment. We will be discharged tomorrow to go home and after a week of being in hospitals I want to know what I can do for both my wife and my daughter that I'm not already doing.

NICUParents,Second time NICU parent. Baby boy was born at 37w+1 but is not feeding well or regulating his temperature. I just want answers. Why is our full term baby not thriving?,"I had just unsubscribed from this subreddit, thinking I’d never be back here again. But here we are. I don’t feel scared, just devastated and confused.

My daughter’s birth was traumatic, and she suffered a brain injury due to lack of oxygen. She was cooled for 72 hours and stayed in the NICU for 14 days. I was in the ICU for the first 7 of those days recovering from severe sepsis (I had chorioamnionitis resulting from an appendectomy at 34 weeks). So my husband had to experience the worst of her NICU stay. By the time I was discharged and able to visit her, she was off oxygen and almost out of the warmer. 

Now it’s my turn to be the main NICU parent, and it is grueling. It started off with a big scare at the pediatrician on day 3 of his life. He was being seen due to having lost 10% of his body weight. They checked his glucose and it was extremely low, so we walked over to the nursery immediately and got him admitted. Right off the bat he needed oxygen and an IV and his body temp was 93. It was so scary to watch this all happening so quickly.

Now he’s on day 5 of his life and still feeding him is like a race against time, as his awake periods are so short and his stamina is almost nothing. The nurse said he’s acting like a much more premature baby, even though he was technically full term. 

They thought maybe he had an infection, but so far all the tests are coming back negative. I’m just so confused as to why my perfect boy isn’t able to wake up and have lots of big meals and get big and strong. I know it’s only day 5, and lots of babies take a week to start putting weight back on. But most babies don’t need this much help. 

So I’m worried he has a huge developmental delay. Our daughter is in special ed due to a delay, possibly caused by her birth injury. I always thought our son would be given an easier start and not have to go through therapies and services and would be able to just be “normal”. But now I don’t know. I just want answers, I guess, and having a hard emotional day.",32,20,2020-05-21,full term birth
NICUParents,My full term baby developed breathing issues due to fluid in his lungs a few days after birth,"My baby was born 9/22 at 39 weeks 1 day.  He had a low heart rate and a low body temperature at birth, so he was taken to the NICU to be put under the warmer and to be evaluated for cardiac issues.  I have a genetic cardiac condition, so it was upsetting but not surprising to discover that he has it too.  He was put on proper medication and his heart rate went up and his body temperature became stable as well.  

We were preparing for him so be discharged when his oxygen saturation started taking alarming dips.  They did a chest X-ray on him and discovered that he had fluid in his lungs.  He was put on oxygen and will now need to stay a few extra days to clear out his lungs and get weaned off of oxygen.

I’ve heard of TTN, but from what I understand, it presents itself almost immediately after birth.  The doctors don’t fully understand why his issue didn’t start until about 3 days after birth.  I’m so grateful that we were already in the right place for him to get treatment when they caught it and that he was not discharged too soon, but I can’t help but worry about him.  The doctors haven’t actually used the term TTN to describe his condition, so there may be something different going on.

We are talking about growing our family and possibly having our second baby sometime next year. I feel excited, but also so so nervous. No one can tell me what went wrong to cause the premature birth, just that there is a higher risk for a second preemie after you’ve already had one.

NICUParents,Mourning the third trimester I didn't have,"I delivered my son in August at 28 weeks. His original due date was Oct 28th. My delivery was entirely unexpected, I had had an easy and healthy pregnancy without a single sign that anything was wrong, until one day my boy just stopped moving. We went into L&D for an ultrasound and I was rushed into the OR, totally in shock and not understanding. 

So I made the mistake of revisiting my October BabyBumps group tonight and it was filled with people's positive birth stories with full-term or barely preemie babies, and it just filled me with so much sadness and I started sobbing. Every time I go to visit my son and have to see a proud happy mama being wheeled out of L&D with her nice healthy newborn, I cry. When I see pregnant women out in the grocery store...yep, that's right-- I cry.   

 I know it's no good to dwell on the could-have-beens but it's so hard not to. I can't help but think about how I'm ""supposed to be"" super pregnant right now, feeling my baby wiggle inside of me, looking for tips on getting him to drop...all that third trimester stuff. This was my first pregnancy and I was enjoying it, and it just ended 2/3 of the way through. I never even wore the majority of my maternity clothes. I never got to let my mom feel baby moving inside of me. My son is doing ok in the NICU and hopefully will be out shortly after his original due date. I love him so much and am so glad to have him....I just wish things had been different.",53,22,2020-10-10,full term birth
NICUParents,Please know that the struggles you’re facing now will pass. You’re not alone.,"Hi everyone. I gave birth to my sweet baby boy on July 18th, 2019. He just turned 1. His birthday had sent me spiraling down memory lane. 

To all of you parents who are sitting in a rocking chair next to an isolette right now, feeing like time isn’t even moving anymore: it’s gets better. I cannot begin to imagine what it is like being the parent of a preemie in today’s world, as it is so vastly different from what it was a year ago when I was in your position. I know there are days where you hate everything and days where it feels like a dream. I know there are days where you pray to whatever god will listen, whether you believe in them or not. I know that the emotional toil that it takes to gets through every day can be crushing, but there are better days ahead. The day when you buckle your sweet baby into their car seat and walk out of those doors for the last time. The day when they start taking full feeds for bottle or breast. The days where you can pick them up without waiting for touch time. Those days will come. I don’t want to tell you that a year from now it will all be a distant memory because that didn’t hold true for me, but the experiences you’re going through now with your baby or babies will change you. It’ll bring out a fire inside of you like you’ve never known, and the only ones who truly know that feeling is the army of NICU parents behind you, supporting you however we can. 

To all of you parents approaching the first birthday: whatever feelings you’re feeling are valid. I myself have been a mess this month, reliving the memory of my weeks in antepartum and my sons birth. I know he is home and safe, but the grief cycle is real is and we’re all working past that sense of loss that I know a lot of us feel. While this is your baby’s first birthday, it really is a time to take care of yourself. Do what you need to to get through the day. If you’re happy, be happy. If you’re sad, be sad.

I joined here when my son was born and have posted a bit, mostly lurked, since. I started a virtual support group on Facebook for fellow preemie parents trying to navigate parenting a preemie, because it is so different than parenting full term, healthy babies. 

I wanted to share a photo of my son, Alexander. From 2 lbs to 20 lbs. He is amazing. He has some delays and we’re working on meeting milestones, but he is happy. He knows how to shake his head no when I try to give him something he doesn’t like. He laughs and laughs in the mornings when I go to get him from his crib. He so intently watches the world around him. He was worth every single moment of everything I went through.

NICUParents,Denied VBAC,"I had my daughter at 26 weeks due to complications from severe preeclampsia. She was IUGR and spent 137 days in the NICU. I was told by all the docs that I should wait to get pregnant again until my daughter was 18 months. They said to lose the weight. They said to get my BP down. I did ALL those things. 

Two weeks ago I found out I was pregnant. I had my first appt today and was told that I am not a good candidate for a VBAC because of the J incision that was made with my daughter....I am so completely, utterly devastated . I cannot describe how upset I am. It took everything in me to not fall out in the doctor's office. 

I feel like I have failed as a woman and a mother. I am ashamed that my body could not figure out how to work properly. I feel like I have failed my daughter by not being able to give birth to her vaginally or at full term. All I wanted was to be able to do it right...to redeem myself...and I was told no. I am so heartbroken.

I know ultimately that it is because they want me and my unborn baby to be safe...I know I am being 100% selfish. I am even thinking about going against my best interest and just asking them to 'let me try'. 

Have any of you experienced something like this? What are your stories? Please...I need some advice...and badly.",17,20,2020-11-11,full term birth
NICUParents,23+0 Twin Girls,"It’s been a rollercoaster for the the past three weeks.  All started on my wife’s routine mfm visit and the sonogram tech noticed she was dilated 2-3cm.  Our mfm dr came in and said she wasn’t comfortable placing a cerclage herself and recommended bed rest but it was likely my wife would go into pre-term labor fairly soon.  We were immediately heartbroken, but another Dr in the group took a look and thought he could do it.  It took two tries but ultimately got it in and was happy and let us know that as long as there was no infection in the next two weeks or go into labor he thought it would hold much longer.  Over the next 2.5 weeks we were in and out of the hospital 3 times for various levels of bleeding and the only thing they could tell us was that the cerclage looked good, no infection, and they didn’t know for sure what the bleeding was but suspected some level of placental abruption.  Eventually she had a bad bleeding episode so they admitted her for observation.

The next few days were uneventful, a little bleeding that came and went, however, she woke up one night having severe cramps.  They tried calming it but ultimately did an exam and she was dilated 4-5cm and the dr said they had to remove the cerclage and she’d likely deliver at 22+6 very quickly after removal. This was early morning and after consulting with nicu they wouldn’t intervene.  I can’t even describe how much pain and loss we experienced after that news.  We cried in each other’s arms and eventually told the nurse we were ready to remove the cerclage and place an epidural. After that was done we were told it would happen quickly.  Well, it didn’t we waited around in the delivery room for another 12 hours grieving and saying goodbye and bursting into tears in and off, but the twins just didn’t want to budge.  My wife was dilated at 9.5cm for pretty much the full 12 hours and the nurse and dr on call both said they’d never seen anything like that before.  The around 7pm the dr consulted with nicu and the nicu dr on call came up and talked with us and said they would intervene based on our decision.  

Over the previous weeks we were struggling with what we would do if we had to make this choice between 23+0 and 23+6.  It ended up being the easiest decision of our lives.  They fought like hell to stay in my wife’s womb and easily decided they deserved every chance we could give them to survive outside.  After that it was a flurry of preparation and my wife got additional meds to help with their lungs and bleeding and eventually gave birth to our sweet baby girls 12hours later.  

I can’t bring to describe the joy of being given this chance for them even knowing everything is stacked against them in the comings days/weeks/months.  The nicu nurses and drs have so far been the kindest and sweetest people I’ve ever met and I know they’re in the best possible hands now.  I don’t know what will happen but I’m just so thankful that I’ll get to know them at least a little and let them know they are loved.

They’re both 2.5 days old and doing about as well as the drs could expect and just waiting to ride out this honeymoon phase so we know the bigger picture.",64,17,2020-06-03,full term birth
NICUParents,"3 weeks in the NICU, born at 28+3. Worried about growth trajectory","My son was born through spontaneous preterm labor 3 weeks ago on 8/26 at 28+3.  He's very healthy as far as being premature goes, and was at 2 lb 9 oz when and 15 inches when he was born.  He finally started climbing above his birth weight about 10 days in, and is now at 3 lb 1 oz, but is struggling with episodes of apnea.

&#x200B;

I am a bit concerned about his growth though - over the last 3 weeks he gets measured on length and head circumference every Sunday, but his head circumference has only gone up 1 cm from 26 to 27 cm, and his length has gone from 37 to 38 cm, which is still at 15 inches.

It's her only problem. She just can't regulate her temp. 

Does anyone have experience with this? When will we get to take our baby girl home???? Blah.",1,14,2020-06-27,full term birth
NICUParents,Some perspective two years out,"Tonight I watched my husband tell my toddler ""Don't touch the buttons on the dishwasher!"" as he then scooped her into his arms and tickled her with his beard against her neck. And for a moment I felt a flashback to him holding her in the NICU, just 34+5, her little nasal feeding tube and various cords dangling everywhere, one FIFTH the size she is now. And I felt such immense gratitude. Gratitude that she's okay, and I'm okay, and we've got a chunky lil shorty who is sharp as a tack, babbling happily in English and Spanish, saying such clever things like ""La pelela es casa caca"" (the potty is poop house!)  Telling me that the very hungry caterpillar in her book  is ""grande y gorda como Mamá"" (big and fat like Mama) who happens to be pregnant with her sibling at the moment, a baby whom i like to joke is between 50 and 75 percent ""done on the inside"", depending on whether I deliver early again or full term this time. 

I know some situations are more complicated than others, and ours was a relatively short stay of just nine days in NICU, but the experience will stay with me for life. And I just want anyone else going through that unexpected journey at the moment to know that one day you'll have such a mundane moment that will bowl you over in such gratitude, and, in some ways, with enough time, you'll see that the weight was a gift.

NICUParents,2 weeks in the NiCU,"I was nervous to post about her because I was worried things would change but It’s been two weeks and 1 day since little Naomi has come into this world. She just turned 26 weeks. It’s been exactly as many of you told me it would be. A rollercoaster of up an downs.

From the time she was born, she only weighed 1 lb 3 oz. immediately the team of NICU doctors rushed her away. I watched desperately as she was hooked up to many cables and machines to get her body stable. Even though it felt like eternity, 25 mins had gone by and she was stable. The doctor let me cut the cord and soon we were headed to a room set aside for her to start this journey. 

In the first few days, she was on a ventilator with the lowest settings. Coupled that with other lines for iv, blood, etc, everything just terrified me. I watched and waited for hours while my wife was in recovery from her c-section. I couldn’t believe how small Naomi was. I just hoped that she would be okay for just one more hour and every time that happened, I would say “ok now one more hour” i didn’t sleep at all that night and I remember just getting up at 2 am just to go visit. 

Day 2 really started to hit home about what happened. She was here and many of the doctors and nurses explained to us things like terminology, what the machines do, how she might respond, everything that we needed to kind wrap our heads around since she was so premature. At the end of it, I received a book from the hospital about preemies. Thinking back, the information from it really helped me calm down since I could at least start to expect what could happen.  

From that point on, Naomi really began to shine. She was responding well to everything. Pooping great, breathing fine. Doctors did a head ultrasound on day 3 and day 14 and both came up good. No brain bleeds. By day 5 my little Naomi got off the ventilator and has been on bubbles since. She had her moments, some Brady’s here and there which she would break out of herself. Desats as well.  It wasn’t all prefect though. Her breathing has fallen somewhat, she used to be around the 26-30 percent oxygen but now she’s been as high as 46 percent. We hope that as time continues to pass, her lungs will do better. She had an infection too, which the doctors immediately caught and got her on the right antibiotics which saved the hassle of having to remove the picc line early. Her sugars too have been erratic. From 160 to highs of 300. Doctors put her on insulin drips and only today has she been off for a few hours with sugars around 170. Her weight was another issue, losing those precious grams scared the wife and I. Even though it’s normal it really got to us that our small little one could get even smaller. Eventually she began to bounce back and with her full feedings, she’s 560 grams now, maybe even more when they weigh her tonight. Lastly, she has had 2 blood transfusions and maybe a third coming as well since her nurses do a lot of blood gasses to track her levels. 

 I apologize for the wall here of text, but I just wanted to share this little bit of light that I have with each of you. Naomi has really healed a bit of me in the time she’s been here. As always I cross my fingers for one more hour with my little one. I hope each of you here have all the positivity in the world if you are in the NiCU as well.",30,7,2020-07-22,full term birth
NICUParents,"NICU Parents, advice? Baby boy graduated NICU two weeks after birth.","This sub has been so amazing for me during the time my little one was in the NICU.
Though I didn't really post, each story, heartwarming or scary really touched me. Everyone one of you are so damn strong and amazing parents. 
My NICU adventure was completely from left field. I was diagnosed with Preclampsia at full term (39.5 weeks) and was induced within hours of diagnosis. Baby boy was so healthy throughout pregnancy. Then during a long pushing process he suffered with shoulder Dystocia and lost oxygen. He was unresponsive when they laid him on my chest. 
He went from the 72hr cooling pad therapy, to oxygen, to feeding tube to now a normal baby. I'm so thankful our road wasn't as long as most ❤️
With all of that explained....to NICU parents who are home with their babies ...how did you feel?
I love my son. I've cried over my son. I love to bond with my son, whether that's when he latches or just holding him and hearing him breathe. 
He was discharged yesterday. And though I was, and am, so relieved..I thought I would be more excited. Now it's just pumping, changing, holding him and feeding him.
Family members keep asking if I cried tears of joy during discharge, and I didn't. 
I'm not sure if I just haven't had time to process but I'm just moving forward with our new life now. No NICU visit, scheduling early intervention, making sure he starts associating night time with longer naps...etc.
I can't help but feel like a bad mother..that I wasn't more excited or emotional.
Has any other parent gone through this?
My husband suggests I should just cut myself some slack because of how much I've been through.",3,2,2020-07-03,full term birth
NICUParents,Full term nephew on day 2 in NICU,"This is honestly me just looking for any kind of answers. My nephew was born 2 days ago full term, c section, and he was 7 lbs 14oz 19 inches long. He was immediately whisked away to NICU, Docs citing low O2 saturation. He was sedated and put on CPAP and was stable for almost 24 hours. Vitals took a turn for the worse and he was placed on a ventilator. At this point we have gotten zero sense of what is actually causing the issue and no explanation of what is going on with our little guy. About an hour ago they told us they are having difficulty keeping him stable on vent. 

I guess I am just wondering if there is anyone in this community that has had a similar experience and if there are any answers to be had. Thank you in advance",19,12,2020-10-29,full term birth
