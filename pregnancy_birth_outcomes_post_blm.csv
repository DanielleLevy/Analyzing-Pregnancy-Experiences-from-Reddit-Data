BabyBumps,Some very “WTF” things they don’t tell you about pregnancy.,"25 weeks, first-time mom. Here is a list of things that NO ONE bothered to tell me about being pregnant:

1. You haven’t actually stopped peeing until you try it once, stand up, sit down and then pee a second time. Leaving the house without doing this will bring you a world of regret (especially since public restrooms aren’t a thing right now.)

2. Your nipples will leak without telling you and then they will dry, and you’ll look down the next morning and immediately think you have cancer or a rare nipple disease oh my god. 

3. Speaking of nipples, they are permanently erect now and they feel like fire at all times. You can cut glass with them. You are now Andy Bernard in that episode of The Office with the rabies fun-run. 

4. Your baby can, and WILL, kick you square in the butthole from inside the womb. They do not apologize. Do not expect flowers. 

5. First kicks don’t always feel like butterflies or a fun little goldfish. They can also feel like your bladder is trying to off itself one explosion at a time. It will launch you off the couch in a panic and there is nothing you can do about it. 

6. You won’t know where your stomach is anymore now that your organs are all squished around. Your doctor doesn’t know. Your midwife doesn’t know. Nobody fucking knows but you’ll still get reminded that it’s there by the HOT LAVA heartburn that happens if you even THINK about a banana before going to sleep. 

7. Doing the dishes takes three sessions because standing up is impossible for more than two minutes. You will feel like you need an oxygen tank. Or a priest. 

8. Constipation is more difficult than normal because, as you may remember from #6, you don’t know or understand where your organs are anymore. Your body is just trying to poop but your liver and kidneys suddenly have to voice their shitty opinions, as well as whatever the hell is in your ribcage at the moment, and you more than likely will google “AM I DYING?” at four AM. This will happen more than once. 

Have I missed anything? I’m only 25 weeks so I guess I get another full trimester to find out. Pregnancy is such a BEAUTIFUL MIRACLE.

Haven’t even told my husband yet.

BabyBumps,I had my daughter 5 months ago. I just came her to share a bit and say ALWAYS TRUSY YOUR BODY. It's because of someone's misfortune and heartbreak sharing on here that my daughter and I are alive.,"I had a very rough pregnancy. Very high risk with lots of complications. I also have very bad medical anxiety and fear I'm wasting doctors time and that what if I'm faking and just don't know it?


I had gone to the hospital 20+ times at 34 weeks. Mostly for real issues. Had actually been admitted for a few days a few times.


Well I had just left the hospital on a Friday and started not feeling right Saturday evening. Sunday morning a poor mother shared her story of not trusting her body and unfortunately losing her child. She was sharing awareness for other moms and I am beyond thankful for her.


She was having a lot of the same issues as me.


Didn't feel baby moving, bad headache, and just a bad feeling.


So I called my ob, told her I was coming in something didn't feel right I hadn't felt baby girl move in over 12 hours. Called my husband to leave work early and come get me because I was too lightheaded to even walk by then.


We get in, my blood pressure is through the roof, my protein is up, my uric acid is up, and they are having a really hard time finding baby. My ob stopped by and told me ""you're a ticking time bomb. I can't send you home"" so I stayed overnight. The next morning my favorite nurse who I knew a bit by then, came in super sad. Informed me she was really sorry but my numbers were rapidly going up. I was going to be induced. We started including at exactly 35 weeks.


I had gone from risky blood pressure to full blown pre E overnight. It took 3 days to get me to dilate. When I started pushing and got baby girls head out I had my ob scream at me to stop pushing. Turns out baby girl had wrapped her cord around her next a few times and that's why her heart beat was down, and she wasn't moving a lot. Thankfully after almost 4 weeks in the nicu she got to come home, and now we have a happy semi healthy 5 month old spit fire.


However if that post wouldn't have convinced me it was better to waste a doctors time and be wrong than not go in and be right, both my daughter and I would be dead. Mama's, listen to your body. Listen to your instincts. Even if you nothing outwardly is wrong if you KNOW something is up go in.


Stay safe. Stay healthy. Stay excited.


And to that mama, who posted on like June 4th or 5th in so sorry for your loss, but thank you so so so much for sharing. I will literally never forget you.",1863,93,2020-11-21,pregnancy anxiety,466,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,Just had my first appointment at a fertility clinic and turns out - I’m already pregnant!!!!,"For the last couple years I’ve had irregular periods, I used to only get them every 6 weeks and now it’s every other month.  My family doctor has never been able to diagnose the reasoning for it and said sometimes women just don’t ovulate for no explained reason and that when I’m ready to start trying, he’ll refer me to a fertility specialist right away.  My fiancé and I decided to start trying at the end of October and my family doc immediately wrote me the referral.

Since then, I’ve been mentally preparing myself for the upcoming struggle ahead and have lost sleep for the past month about it.  The initial ultrasounds and bloodwork are supposed to be done on your period so I’ve been waiting for mine to come and finally Tuesday this week I started to bleed and booked my appointments.  The next day I stopped bleeding and the clinic told me to keep my appointments anyways.  This just made even more upset thinking that the stress I’ve been putting on myself is making my menstrual cycle even more messed up.
 
Today I went in, did my ultrasounds and bloodwork and the OB came to speak to me after and told me I’M ALREADY PREGNANT!!!!!! He said I’m only 4-5 weeks and that it’s still really early but I immediately started sobbing.

For years now I’ve been hating my body for not being “normal” with no unexplainable reason.  I had already prepared myself for the thought of years of trying to conceive and all the medication or procedures I might have to take and just knowing that my body IS ovulating and I’m able to conceive has been the biggest weight ever lifted off my shoulders.  Whether or not I make it to full term I’m just so happy to know that something is working and even though it’s too early to share with friends and family...I had to share this good news with someone who might also be worried their irregular period automatically means infertility.

Any early term advice is greatly appreciated and I’m so excited to be on this journey with all you other women out there!

Update:  I set up cupcakes and a pregnancy announcement on my fiancé’s desk for when he got home.  Worst timing he came home when I was on a video conference call with my work team!! He was jumping and screaming and ran to gave me kisses.  Fortunately I muted and turned my camera off in time.  Ironically enough on the call my colleague shared for the first time that his wife is pregnant and due in the spring. I’m the only female on my team and everyone kept telling me I’m next!  I laughed it off but little do they know I just found out today that I actually am!! It will be funny to tell them later that the same day they told me I’m next, was actually the same day I found out I was pregnant!",1661,187,2020-12-11,pregnancy stress,499,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,In the hospital 18.5 weeks pregnant recovering from brain surgery.,"These past few days have been the absolute scariest days of my life and I just need to talk and share with other moms.
I am 18.5 weeks pregnant and since week 12 ish I’ve had terrible headaches. I called my OB twice who has helped a ton with meds and just trying to get me through that second trimester headache wave. Thursday afternoon it was so bad no meds were helping and I could barely see. My OB sent me to labor and delivery triage and after giving meds with no improvement decided to do an MRI just Incase.
Within an hour I was told I had three brain aneurysms one 14mm long that was already leaking and was rushed my ambulance to our university hospital neurological ICU and in brain surgery within hours.
I don’t remember much I just remember being so scared for my baby boy and begging for them to make him safe.
After a 5 hour surgery everything is fixed went perfectly and I’ve been able to see him on an US and listen to his heart tones five times a day since. 
I am so thankful I caught it in time. He was kicking so much before I went under anesthesia it’s something I’ll never forget. I felt like he was just telling me “we got this mom” I just can’t believe we’ve been through so much together already. He’s so damn tough😭
Our bodies are seriously miraculous. Thanks for letting me share, alone in the hospital and just wanted to talk💙


******Thank you from the bottom of my heart for these kind messages. I’m trying to respond and answer but with my head pain and left arm/hand weakness it’s getting exhausting lol!

BabyBumps,Can we please stop calling it “natural birth” to describe a vaginal birth?,"My unplanned cesarean birth was not natural because we utilized medical procedures to have a safe delivery. I wanted and tried to have a ‘natural birth’ ... A VAGINAL birth, the way your body is designed to release the baby. We tried and tried and she would not come out. It was time to trust the medical professionals who said it was time to do a C-section. Yes, it is not the natural way to have a baby, fine. But every time you post a comment, title, or story and refer to vaginal birth as ‘natural birth’ ... it alludes that my cesarean delivery was an UNNATURAL birth. It’s just not very sensitive. And nothing about me doing anything possible to have my baby safely is unnatural. It’s completely natural to use everything available to you to protect your baby, even if it means getting your own body sliced and diced.

BabyBumps,A PSA from a L&D RN to anyone who might need to hear this ❤️,"A disclaimer: I’m not a lurker, I’m also on this journey (for the 4th time!) with y’all! 

On to my message:

I’ve been so thankful to have these groups to keep me entertained, celebrate, commiserate (GD!), and learn about new things! One thing that I keep seeing pop up is about moms not wanting to impose on the nurses during labor, feeling embarrassed about things that happen during labor/pp, or worrying about expressing their desires during the hospitalization. 

I’m here to speak for majority of L&D RNs when I say - WE LOVE OUR JOBS!! We know that with labor and childbirth comes strong emotions, family dynamics, throw up, blood, poop, sweat, and other fluids. And that’s okay! Cause we also know that as part of our job description, we get to be there when little babies come into the world and take their very first breath, when women get to witness just how amazing their own body is to have created a perfect little person, and see their own strength to have gone thru childbirth- whether vaginally or via major surgery. I mean- come on! does it get any better than that?!

We as women often have such complex relationships with our body images, for one reason or another. And to be present when a fellow woman has the opportunity to see that we are made for this... well that is just another perk of the job. 

I know that some of you may have seen us when we are not at our best and I’m sorry about that. We are just people too. We may have walked in the door and been rushed back to the OR to take over a crash c-section, had to support a family who lost their baby, you may be the third delivery of our shift, we may have not sat down for a proper meal for 12 hours, or shifts go by when we’ve literally started the day with a cup of coffee on the drive in and not had a sip of anything for the duration of the shift. So if you see us at that moment, we try not to show it but sometimes, it’s hard not to carry that weight from patient to patient. It doesn’t mean we don’t love our job, it just means we are flawed like everyone else. We love what we do!

So if you are worried about bothering us cause you are nauseous or throwing up, if you feel bad about pooping when you push, if you are nervous about holding it together on our account, I’m here to say: don’t! We have seen it all, cleaned it all, endured a lot, and yet we still *love* what we do! 

I hope this message finds anyone out there who needed to hear this. We are so excited to be a part of your labor and delivery experience! 

xo,

AskDocs,UPDATE: [26F] recommended for termination of pregnancy in a country where I don't speak the language,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/ici7ez/26f_recommended_for_termination_of_pregnancy_in_a/

First of all I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you not only to the physicians who responded but also to everyone who upvoted and comment-bumped me for visibility. Obviously the physician responses helped on the medical end, but the simple comment bumps helped so much emotionally. I'm in this country without family (except for my husband and toddler) and sometimes it honestly gets really lonely so having even the tiniest bit of online support meant the world to me. I even want to thank the user who posted anti-semitic comments because your comment specifically helped this hella Jewish woman connect with other Jewish women on this forum who offered hands-on support, validation, and rescoures. 

I had a meeting with the specialists in the termination committee today and they diagnosed the pregnancy with cystic hygroma in addition to other serious physical (nasal, respiratory, heart) malformations that would make the fetus 100% incompatible with life. They made it pretty dang clear that I could basically miscarry at any moment, which sounds about right to me as a layman given all this info. We asked about genetic testing/probability of this happening again and they said it's very unlikely, the occurrence of this situation is less than one percent overall. So I've decided to forgo any additional testing like CVS or amniocentesis as a chromosomal defect would just be another issue on the list and not a defining factor in my choice. 

So unless nature takes it course, I'm scheduled for an inpatient termination this coming Monday. I can't really find anything online about inpatient terminations, but they gave me the choice and explained that the outpatient procedure would be started with dilation by osmotic dilators and move quickly while the inpatient procedure would use slow, supervised dilation with less trauma over 48 hours. I'm not 100% sure if they meant physical trauma or emotional trauma, as they mentioned some people find it very uncomfortable and impeding (especially with childcare) to do the outpatient dilation and return to the hospital for the procedure.  I'd read about osmotic dilation earlier and it really freaked me out so I was super happy to have this previously unknown option offered. 

I'm feeling a lot more secure after hearing from everyone in this community, my doctor, and today's specialists. I never in a million years thought I'd be terminating a wanted pregnancy for any reason but I still have thousands and thousands of chances to have another baby just waiting in my ovaries so I'm going to focus on that and also on my toddler who is already my whole world. And I'm thankful in that I've experienced this and can hopefully help women who are in this situation in the future. 
Thanks everybody!

*Edit just to add that all the doctors and social workers on the committee and at the hospital we went to spoke near perfect English which was a great relief for me and we did not have to spend money we don't have on an interpreter.

*Later edit to update that the genetic blood test came back early and indicated 1:5 for down syndrome and trisomy 18.",1078,52,2020-08-24,pregnancy trauma,530,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,"3 weeks ago, found out I was pregnant. Thought I was 6 or 7 weeks at the time. After first ObyGyne app. (4 days ago), found out I was almost 32 weeks pregnant. See comment for more info.","How does this happen you ask?  Well, I was diagnosed with PCOS last year and had doctors telling me if it was normal in my condition to not have a period due to the situation.  I've never had a child before and I work a laborious job that puts my body in low level pain alot.  3 weeks ago, I got to this point where I couldn't understand why I was having to pee all the time and I was taking a new medication that I thought could maybe causing some side effects.

I still had this inkly of thought to think about pregnancy and finally just randomly said to my husband ""Hey, would you mind if I took a rapid pregnancy test?  I don't want to just get one and have you freak out on me if you find me doing it and it's just to dispell some concerns.  I honestly don't think I'm pregnant"".

He nicely bullied me then to get the test and late that night I get a surprise positive test reading.  Husband gently freaks and has a mini internal crisis (new daddy thoughts).  I then got into my primary to take a blood test following day and on Columbus day, got positive results with estimate of 6 to 7 weeks.

I then struggled and filled out fifty billion forms to get into an obygyne clinic that wasn't able to see me until 2 weeks following.  When I get in, the pandemic forced me to go alone and I, again, was expecting something unexpected I just got blown out of the water.

The woman goes to plunk the wand inside me, then takes it out and really quickly changes to the sonogram.  This is when I get told ""So you think you are around 10 weeks hun? .....Well you're actually more than that"".

""Okay.....how much more?""

""Ohh...I'd say around 28 or 29 weeks...""

....I start hyperventilating and Ohmygodding and she had to spend 5 to 10 minutes talking me into a calmer state.  Baby seems to have strong heart beat and she told me baby looks good.  The next room I get pulled into I get told I'm actually 31 weeks and 4 days estimate.

Long story short, my husband and I thought we'd have many many more months to prepare and now we have less than 8 weeks to get everything ready for the little firecracker coming in hot into our lives.  We are happy, we are just scared.  

So with that, do any of you have nice suggestions on baby items I may need that I wouldn't think of?  I'm trying to compile from baby registry on Amazon but I'm worried there may be secret amazing needs that I have no time to thoroughly learn or get in the ""know"" about.  I appreciate any suggestions!

....I start hyperventilating and Ohmygodding and she had to spend 5 to 10 minutes talking me into a calmer state.  Baby seems to have strong heart beat and she told me baby looks good.  The next room I get pulled into I get told I'm actually 31 weeks and 4 days estimate.

Long story short, my husband and I thought we'd have many many more months to prepare and now we have less than 8 weeks to get everything ready for the little firecracker coming in hot into our lives.  We are happy, we are just scared.  

So with that, do any of you have nice suggestions on baby items I may need that I wouldn't think of?  I'm trying to compile from baby registry on Amazon but I'm worried there may be secret amazing needs that I have no time to thoroughly learn or get in the ""know"" about.  I appreciate any suggestions!

BabyBumps,What I'll do again for my next baby,"I enjoyed reading motherly advice on here before I had my girl 8 months ago at 36 weeks/6lb. Here's what stuck with me, YMMV, every pregnancy/baby is different:


1. Hospital bag/Hospital:


 The hospital has everything baby needs, focus on your own comfort. Hormones made me hot and sweaty so feeling clean helped a lot.


Postpartum room essentials: 6' phone charger cable, robe, sleep mask, water bottle, bath sheet, flip flops, soft clothes/underwear (I'm a size 16 and the mesh underwear was uncomfortably small), facial wipes, dry shampoo, gatorade, nail clipper, razor, snacks, folder to put all the paperwork/copy of marriage certificate for the registrar

Edit: Lip balm! Epidural drugs make your lips super dry


The newborn going-home clothes I brought were too big for my 6lb late-term preemie baby, next time I'll pack a preemie outfit.


2. Home prep


I put a mattress protector on my bed around 30 weeks... Good thing since my water broke in my sleep, surprise!


Next time, I will clean and sterilize some bottles and pump parts in advance. You don't want to be reading pump instructions while your hungry baby cries because they're unable to latch onto your breast.


I will also have some freezer meals ready, it wasn't the end of the world, but it would have been nice.


3. Diapering/ Cleaning


I've cleaned a lot of baby messes by now, these work:  
- Dawn blue dish soap for fresh stool stains. 
- Oxy clean soak for yellowed hand-me-downs with oxidized drool stains. 
- Dreft stain remover to pre-treat spit up/milk stains before putting in hamper (I keep the spray bottle near the changing table)


We keep disposable blue underpads for diaper changing, it has mitigated the damage from many pee fountains. They're also great in the diaper bag and in the car, and are useful to contain poopsplosion-baby while you run a bath for them.


We cut a dedicated sponge for cleaning baby dishes and toys. Regular sponge is too big to fit most of them.


4. Random 


I avoid Velcro now, it's loud/startles my baby and gets stuck to things in the laundry.


I will remind myself baby doesn't need to be stimulated all day long.


I'll never have enough bibs and they will save countless outfits


Baby congestion was a big problem for us. It affected her feeding and sleep and we didn't know why at first! Spray saline and a nasal aspirator saved us.


In an emergency sometimes the floor is the safest place to put your baby. No baby has ever fallen off the floor.




5. Finally, these are things from our registry that we use/don't use:


Must (we use these every day multiple times a day): 

- Bouncy seat

- Nursing pillow (for feeding, napping, playing, climbing, protect while sitting on floor...)

- Sound machine (white noise, ocean waves...)  

- Ubbi diaper pail. 

- Dishwasher basket for bottle parts. 

- Bandana bibs. 


Nice to have:

- Wipes dispenser with weight (like Oxo Perfect Pull)
- Haakaa


Not used:

- Bottle brush (bottles go in dishwasher)  

- Too many fitted sheets (guess I was expecting night blowouts on the reg), really only need 2

- Baby monitor (small enough place that we're always within earshot)

Thank you for reading this novel. On mobile, holding a baby, and English is not my first language, sorry if something looks wrong. Good luck!

BabyBumps,"Why is it expected/acceptable that women will suffer through pregnancy without treatment for ailments, compromising their own health and well-being, just for the sake of the fetus?","I’m about 8 weeks pregnant and already at my wits end. I’ve taken issue with women’s healthcare in the US for a long time, but the treatment of women during pregnancy is by far the worst. 

This is a planned pregnancy, and I understood in advance that pregnancy is just one of the millions of sacrifices a mother will make for her child. However, I have a sneaking suspicion that if men were the ones who carried a pregnancy, the first-line treatment for debilitating pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting would not be an OTC sedative + vitamin B in the year 2020. That sounds more like a treatment for hysteria in 1820. 

I take several medications normally for asthma, allergies, and acid reflux. MD has advised that she will generously “allow” me to continue taking my asthma medication, but has advised me to stop the others — “heartburn and allergies may make you uncomfortable for a few months, but it’s a small price to pay to have a healthy baby.” As for the nausea? “Ginger and crackers are best.” I’ve lost 7 lbs in 2 weeks, and I was only 110 lbs at baseline. I hardly think that malnutrition and dehydration can be better for the developing fetus than a fucking Prilosec in the morning to keep acid reflux at bay. 

Right now, the “baby” is little more than a blueberry-sized parasite that is feeding off me, but I should be treated as the patient. If I choose to consider the implications of my own treatment on that of a tentative fetus, then that’s my choice to make, just like a patient may cross-reference a recommended treatment against their religious or social preferences. 

My fury is perhaps intensified by the fact that I have a PhD in pharmacology and am well aware of what evidence exists — or doesn’t exist — regarding adverse effects of each medication on a developing fetus.  I wouldn’t take Accutane or tetracycline while pregnant, but the theoretical risk a Claritin tablet poses to the developing fetus is a chance I’m willing to take. When I confronted the MD about the supposed evidence (I was told metoclopramide is a teratogen, which it is not) her only defense was that maybe it doesn’t say in the literature that it’s a teratogen but she has “seen it many times over the years.” Oh really? 😂 So this MD established a causal relationship between metoclopramide and birth defects, purely based on her own anecdotal case studies and observations? I wonder if she got IRB approval for this study. 

The treatment of women, and especially pregnant women, in this country is antiquated and quite frankly disgusting.",839,344,2020-08-24,week of birth,445,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,HR Manager called the Doctor,"I was diagnosed with an insufficient cervix about a month ago at 26 weeks. My doctor sent me to a specialist to get a second opinion who confirmed that I am at risk for preterm delivery.  


I just had a follow up with my doctor Friday where he asked me about my activity and was surprised to hear that I am still working full time. My job isn’t super strenuous but I am constantly getting up and walking around all day and it’s exhausting. He immediately wrote me a doctors note that it is his medical recommendation that I start working from home starting at the end of August. My particular job cannot be done at home but there are many side projects that the company needs done that I can work on from a laptop.  

I have been very forthcoming with HR about all of this and they let me know that even if there are no work from home options, that I can start short term disability early. Today my nurse called me and said she has a voicemail from my HR manager asking for an exact medical reasoning behind me needing to work from home. She said of course that she cannot give out this information because of HIPPA and that she was very surprised that an HR manager asked to begin with considering its not really allowed? I feel like an HR manager should know about HIPPA and I feel like calling was a huge invasion of privacy. I gave her a note and I even explained the insufficient cervix to her! It’s not like I’ve been shady about any of this.  

My nurse is amazing and said that she won’t even tell my HR manager that we spoke and will just tell her point blank that she is not going to release that information.

I overheard the Neonatal doctor telling her  ‘do not let your anxiety and panic attacks get in the way of enjoying your life and your new baby.

AskDocs,"My gf (26F) has posterior fibroids and her menstrual has been so impossibly heavy for the past 2.5 weeks, she can't wear anything for a few hours without completely ruining it. She's also recently developed lightheadedness. Her IUD is also falling out. I'm getting EXTREMELY worried","The above pretty much summarizes it.

She's about 5'6 and 237lbs, African American, non smoker, currently on birth control and standard pain medication.

I've been with her for 2 years and we've only recently started seeing this. Just before Covid, she went to the hospital in February because of extremely heavy flow and cramps of lovecraftian proportions, and the doctors told her that she had posterior fibroids. She was prescribed medication to regulate her period and mitigate blood loss (regular birth control pills and something else, possibly pain meds, iirc), but it has since gotten worse. She has been bleeding HEAVY nonstop since the week before Father's day and I. Am. Worried.


She's now experiencing lightheadedness, shaking, and I'm afraid she's going to pass out due to the perfect storm of trying to work retail, dehydration from the heat, and blood loss. Today at work she noticed that her IUD strings were poking out, so I instructed her to leave work and come straight to me. We're headed to Planned Parenthood in the morning for the IUD, but is this caused by the posterior fibroids? Or is it a coincidence? What can we do to stop her from bleeding so much?

AskDocs,How can I get doctors to ignore my medical condition? (I know how bizarre that sounds!),"36F, 5'5"", 145#, complaining of difficulty communicating with docs, been going on for a while, sometimes alcohol, no drugs.

I have a genetic mutation called GCK-MODY which is kind of like lifelong prediabetes. The nice thing about it is that it doesn't require treatment, it doesn't lead to the usual complications associated with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and my risk for developing other types of diabetes are the same as the general population. 

But damn, I wish I'd never been diagnosed with this. The problem is that every caregiver I encounter sees ""diabetes"" and thinks they know what that means. This mutation is rare enough that unfortunately, I am often a bit more informed than my doctors and nurses about the condition. I try to let them know I don't need counseling about nutrition and exercise, but I always seem to be put on the diabetes ""conveyor belt"" of treatment. This is extra unpleasant because I'm recovering from body image issues and disordered eating, so I can have irrational reactions to things said in these discussions. 

I understand this might sound like I'm ignoring some good advice, so I'll just put this out there that my A1c has been steady at 6.0 for the last six years, I have a healthy diet, and exercise 30-90 minutes six days a week. 

So it's infuriating for EVERY appointment, even with dentists and dermatologists and eye doctors, to start with a check in about how I'm managing my diabetes. I get my health care through a big organization with a central chart database, so every provider no matter what specialty sees ""diabetes"" before they even see my face. I had one obgyn say she would only manage my prenatal care if I agreed to an elective c-section, which is LUDICROUS even though pregnancy is the only time GCK-MODY might impact healthcare protocols.

When I try to explain about the condition, they might seem to listen to me, but then they'll conclude the conversation with a tip about limiting carbs and getting enough exercise, or a mention of what complications I can expect from poorly managed diabetes. It's depressing and irrelevant. 

So docs of Reddit, could you give me some magic words that will nudge medical professionals off the ""diabetes track"" and into care that's appropriate for me?

And by the way thank you so much for the hard work you do to keep people healthy. I really look up to medical professionals regardless of this complaint.",627,136,2020-05-14,pregnancy depression,415,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,1 year old sudden loss of vision,"On Thursday, my 15 month old’s babysitter noticed that she wasn’t making eye contact like normal. At home, I noticed the same thing. Normally, if I look at her and smile she smiles back. But it looked like she was looking right past me. Along with that, she was not tracking objects with her eyes.

I took her to the pediatrician on Friday who was concerned and wanted her to see an ophthalmologist right away. So we did that, she had a full eye exam with her eyes dilated and there was nothing wrong (like far sightedness or strabismus etc) with her eyes. The ophthalmologist was concerned too and called a neurologist who wanted us to go to the ER so we could be admitted into neurology over the weekend.

The ER did a lot of blood work, a spinal tap for fluid (I can’t remember the name- I’m sorry.) and the doctors there just generally said they were stumped.

We are on day 2 of being in the pediatric neurology unit. She’s having an EEG done for 24 hours and hopefully an MRI today. The neurologist says he’s fairly confident she isn’t having seizures but wants to cover everything.

I hope one or both of those things gives us an answer but in the mean time all I have to do is think. What could possibly have caused this loss of vision seemingly overnight? She responds to sounds but not objects. She’s had hundreds of lights (from nurses doctors etc) flashed right in her eyes and she does nothing like you’d expect. They shined a light in my eyes to show me how abnormal it was that she did nothing because I instinctively moved my eyes.

Also... no falls, no high fevers, no recent illness, her birth was normal, she’s developmentally normal.

Its not a measurement error. She measured 5'6"" or 167 cm several times, they have used a stadiometer.

AskDocs,"My PCP doctor believes I’m likely for a premature aging disorder, geneticist disagrees. Should I push for more?","
25 year old male. 

My doctors notes several ‘severe oddities’ for someone my age in my workup;

At 5 I was diagnosed with bilateral cataracts assumed congenital, no family history of this. 

At 14 I had a kidney stone

At 18 I had severe thinning of hair in the traditional horseshoe pattern. NOTE that while my paternal family does have MPB in the family it comes on usually late 30’s early 40’s. My mother’s side ALL the men including her father,  but one kept their hair their whole lives and the one has only a tiny amount of thinning. This was me at 20; https://imgur.com/a/sxyDcR9

I have ‘cherry angiomas’ on my scalp, something common in elderly but rare in young people even morseo on the scalp

I have macrocephaly meaning top 2% head size 

I take excellent care of my teeth and my dentist always compliments me by saying how clean they are but also says that they look like teeth they look that are as worn as they would expect in a 40 year old not early 20’s. He also said I have gum recession despite great dental care. 

Look I know all of these things can happen as isolated traits even the cataracts, I also know we all have oddities that are ‘rare’ in statistics somewhere but this seems like A-LOT of really off things with no family history. The genetics doc seemed to think because I’m otherwise healthy and active etc without issues there’s unlikely to be anything but my doctor didn’t seem happy with that. I guess any input is appreciated. I’m not expecting a diagnoses but this seems like a lot of coincidental occurrences doesn’t it?

EDIT: through insurance and work I get yearly blood CBC and metabolic tests. Always normal or close to it. 
I have seen an endocrinologist and I do have a tiny cyst on my thyroid but I understand that’s very common and otherwise have completely normal thyroid functioning. So healthy there. 

I have also seen neurology and dermatology as well as had an echo and Holter monitor (not due to issues just investigation) and all was normal. Every doc has pretty much said I show no signs of any health concerns. 

Only oddity in blood is low B12 

A BIG NOTE my cataracts were lamellar subtype, meaning that they are either caused by trauma or infection at birth or genetics however my type of cataracts are definitively different and easily told apart from the standard age related cataracts, meaning that them being related to an aging disorder is pretty much ruled out.

No other family history of much besides my father had a very severe case of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.",541,118,2020-08-07,prematurity,454,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Just Learned I'm Pregnant – At 30 - 36 Weeks!,"Hello! I learned last week that I (31 F) am not only pregnant, but 3rd trimester pregnant! I've seen 3 doctors and been given 3 different possible due dates. 

Some background info: I have had PCOS since puberty, so my periods have always been irregular. I have (had) been on birth control for the last 4 years or so. I was diagnosed with lupus in November 2019. All of these factors combined led me to misjudge, ignore, or misappropriate symptoms of pregnancy! In fact, what led me to see a doctor was that I felt a ""mass"" in my abdomen and I was concerned that it might be a large ovarian cyst, or possibly even a tumor. She sent me for a CT scan, but thankfully they did a weak x-ray first and we saw an unmistakable upside-down little skeleton inside of me!

My boyfriend and I are finally getting over the initial shock, but now that I know I have a lot of sadness. I've been pregnant this entire year and I did not know! Thankfully I neither drink nor smoke, but I have so much guilt about ""neglecting"" my baby, not to mention having x-rayed her!! (The radiologist assured me the amount was fine, especially because of how far along I am.)

The earliest estimation of my due date is August 21st (!!!), based off of ultrasound measurements, and the latest is in the beginning of October,  based off the last period I remember. I've read up on it, and late term ultrasound estimations can be off by up to 30 days if there are no others to compare them to! Being so far along, it seems impossible to narrow down this TWO MONTH window! 

We are preparing for the August date, just in case, (baby shower in two weeks, scrambling to turn BF's office into a nursery), but I'm praying to the universe that she stays in until at least late September.

It is extremely stressful and sad not to know when my baby is coming, how far along I am, and to have missed at least 6 months of joyful expectation! To be dealing with Covid-19 restrictions on top of all this...

It is extremely stressful and sad not to know when my baby is coming, how far along I am, and to have missed at least 6 months of joyful expectation! To be dealing with Covid-19 restrictions on top of all this... 

I would really appreciate any words of wisdom, advice, comments, help, anything. Thanks for your time!",539,179,2020-07-25,pregnancy stress,382,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,"My PCP doctor believes I’m likely for a premature aging disorder, geneticist disagrees. Should I push for more?","
25 year old male. 

My doctors notes several ‘severe oddities’ for someone my age in my workup;

At 5 I was diagnosed with bilateral cataracts assumed congenital, no family history of this. 

At 14 I had a kidney stone

At 18 I had severe thinning of hair in the traditional horseshoe pattern. NOTE that while my paternal family does have MPB in the family it comes on usually late 30’s early 40’s. My mother’s side ALL the men including her father,  but one kept their hair their whole lives and the one has only a tiny amount of thinning. This was me at 20; https://imgur.com/a/sxyDcR9

I have ‘cherry angiomas’ on my scalp, something common in elderly but rare in young people even morseo on the scalp

I have macrocephaly meaning top 2% head size 

I take excellent care of my teeth and my dentist always compliments me by saying how clean they are but also says that they look like teeth they look that are as worn as they would expect in a 40 year old not early 20’s. He also said I have gum recession despite great dental care. 

Look I know all of these things can happen as isolated traits even the cataracts, I also know we all have oddities that are ‘rare’ in statistics somewhere but this seems like A-LOT of really off things with no family history. The genetics doc seemed to think because I’m otherwise healthy and active etc without issues there’s unlikely to be anything but my doctor didn’t seem happy with that. I guess any input is appreciated. I’m not expecting a diagnoses but this seems like a lot of coincidental occurrences doesn’t it?

EDIT: through insurance and work I get yearly blood CBC and metabolic tests. Always normal or close to it. 
I have seen an endocrinologist and I do have a tiny cyst on my thyroid but I understand that’s very common and otherwise have completely normal thyroid functioning. So healthy there. 

I have also seen neurology and dermatology as well as had an echo and Holter monitor (not due to issues just investigation) and all was normal. Every doc has pretty much said I show no signs of any health concerns. 

Only oddity in blood is low B12 

A BIG NOTE my cataracts were lamellar subtype, meaning that they are either caused by trauma or infection at birth or genetics however my type of cataracts are definitively different and easily told apart from the standard age related cataracts, meaning that them being related to an aging disorder is pretty much ruled out.

No other family history of much besides my father had a very severe case of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.",537,118,2020-08-07,premature birth,454,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,Multiple Unidentified Masses In Infant’s Leg,"Female
D.O.B 02/02/2020 (19 weeks/5 months old)
26.5” currently (21” at birth)
15lbs6oz currently (8lbs11oz at birth)
White
Full-term/vaginal delivery 
Multiple masses spanning over entire left leg
Noticed and sought treatment April 29th

My daughter has multiple masses within her left leg. The size/pressure has caused her to lose the ability to move her foot. She has seen quite a few specialists that determined she had a vascular/lymphatic malformation with multiple macrocystic hygromas. We were referred to The Hemangioma and Vascular Malformation Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and were seen within a month. 
Nine days after her initial appointment she was scheduled for surgery. Her masses were to be drained and then sclerotherapy was to be performed. 
Roughly 45 minutes after entering the OR my fiancé and I were called to a small room to discuss revised treatment options with her radiologist and newly appointed general surgeon. Her mass was unable to be drained as intended because the contents were thicker than intended and contained tissue(s). 
The general surgeon went on to perform her surgery - removing approximately 200mL of fluids, inserted a drain into her calf, and collected samples for pathology. 
During her time in post-anesthesia recovery: her mass had “refilled” and was nearly the same size/fullness as it was prior to surgery; albeit the mass was not as firm. 
The following day her capillary refill rate and temperature improved in her foot. No notable improvements in her foot/ankle movement. However her hemoglobin levels were low prior to surgery, during anesthesia recovery, and dropped further post-op. After being monitored and given IV fluids we were released to go home. We were discharged with orders to visit a local children’s hospital for a CBC tomorrow (05/23) to rule out the need for transfusion. 
Today, (05/22) we received a call from the pathologist. We were told that the mass is not what she was initially diagnosed with: it is not a hermangioma/hygroma/lymphatic or vascular malformation/cyst. We were told that they aren’t certain what the mass is. We were also informed that cancer has not been ruled out. 
She will be seen this week for a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan, hopefully. 

I will include pre/post op photos and measurements. At this point I am just seeking some sort of direction, what we can possibly expect, what we need to be asking doctors, and if there is anything that anyone can do that isn’t currently being done. Myself and my fiancé want to do all we can but we are scared and at a loss currently. 
TIA.

EDIT: forgot to include that upon discovery (7 weeks ago) the largest mass (calf) resembled an insect bite. It was roughly the size of a ping pong/golf ball. It is now easily soft ball sized.

EDIT #2: I’m sure that anyone would be hesitant to even suggest a diagnosis. That said: I appreciate any and all input. If anything I’m looking for what it *could possibly* be so that I can mentally prepare myself.

BabyBumps,Hey all. Introduction - micro preemie,,404,29,2020-06-08,preemie,1,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,For moms worried about too much weight gain,"I just wanted to share my experience because I would have loved to hear from someone like me when I was still pregnant. In the last few years, I’ve become a plus sized girl. When I got pregnant, my doctor told me to try not to gain more than 20lbs max. I can honestly say I did my absolute best. I was eating healthy, tracking it, doing everything I could the first few months because I was terrified of something going wrong with this pregnancy. I gained no weight until the end of the second trimester, and that’s when the weight came in full force. 


I went from only 2lbs gain to 20lbs in no time flat. I stressed, I worried, I bought all the fresh veggies and fruits and threw away all the junk and the weight just kept piling on. I was eating only 1400 calories a day! I also became more and more hungry. After I reached 30lbs I sort of gave up trying, and I felt awful about it. I ate whatever I felt like. My Dr. was amazing and kept telling me to try and eat as healthy as I could but not to make myself crazy with the stress of it. By the end of my pregnancy, I gained 45lbs and felt like absolute ass for it. I cried so many nights thinking I was hurting my baby and myself and I would never get the weight off. 

Now sitting here 11 days postpartum, looking at my healthy little babe, I’m only 6lbs over my pre-pregnancy weight. We are breast feeding and I know that helps with weight loss, but I’m completely amazed how fast the weight came off. My kiddo was 7lbs 12oz when she was born and is eating very well, and I feel silly for all the self hate and stress I piled on myself during those last few months. 


I guess my advice is to listen to your Dr, eat as healthy as you can, but give yourself some credit and love, you’re growing another human. I wish I had spent some of the time just being amazed at what my body was doing rather than obsessing over my weight the entire time. Obviously, this will not be everyone’s experience, but be kind to yourself.",402,111,2020-12-30,stress during pregnancy,385,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,"Vomiting 3x/day 3-4 days a week since March. Unexplained, extreme weight gain. Period breaking through birth control for weeks on end. Wth is wrong with my body?","Female, 33yo, 5'5"" & 280lbs (150lbs two years ago).

On-going conditions/Medication:
- Bipolar (abilify, 2 years)
- Anxiety (lexapro, 3 years)
- Insomnia (trazodone, 3 years)
- GERD (pantiprazole, 3 months)
- Birth control (Apri, 1.5 years total but a 6 month break in the middle)

Issues: 
- BLEEDING: Two yearsish ago, I gained 100+ lbs in a year with no diet/exercise changes, and I had a heavy period for nearly 6 months straight. I went to a Planned Parenthood because I had no insurance then and they said its probably PCOS but did not do any testing so I have no idea how concrete that diagnosis is. I started birth control and the issue stopped for some time, but now I've been lightly bleeding (through my birth control) for about five weeks.
- VOMITING: Since March, I have been vomiting 3-4 days a week, at *least* 2-3x per day. This happens shortly after eating, no matter what I eat. I was started on Rx anti-acids which seemed to help briefly and are great for my heartburn but I'm still getting sick. Its increasing rapidly, I've been vomiting 2+ times daily for a week now. 
- DIARRHEA/LOOSE BMs: at least 3-4 days per week, 4+ BMs a day. It stops if I take imodium but then I'm constipated so i really hate relying on that so heavily. Its mostly shortly after eating, no matter what I eat,

I've had an upper endoscopy done but they said everything is normal. I was just told to lose weight. I've been trying to for months with a max 5lb change. I exercise several days per week for about thirty minutes per day. I eat a balanced, veggie heavy diet with low carbs and low fat. 

I don't know what to do anymore but I refuse to accept that being sick near constantly is ""normal""!

EDIT: I should mention, I have had bloodwork and fecal exams done and they ruled out Crohns/UC, bacterial infections, and parasitic infections. My thyroid is also normal.

EDIT 2: Added my low dose birth control to medications. My tests have also ruled out pregnancy and celiac. I have no abdominal pain.",396,153,2020-10-07,pregnancy anxiety,362,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,I am furious at my family.,"This is a throwaway account since my friends know my main one. We are expecting our first, and we were excited so we decided to tell our families a little early. It was convenient, we were all going to be on a group call anyway so it would be a fun way to surprise them without being suspicious. We explicitly told them not to tell anyone yet, as we are only at 10 weeks, and things can still happen. 

Not 24 hours later my dad has told his coworkers, my mom has called and told her friends, and my stepmom told her group of friends. We didn't tell them that ""hey don't tell anyone because we could still potentially have a miscarriage"" but just told them it's a family secret don't tell. That should have been enough. 

Anyway, got a text from one of my best friends this morning on ""congratulations, i heard y'all are expecting."" Not really how I wanted him to find out, through a friend of one of my parents, especially when we are still so early along. 

This is just a venting post, I'm so mad at my family that I can't trust them with something so simple. If we have another in the future I guess they will find out when the baby is born, because I'm definitely not trusting them to keep the secret.",343,99,2020-08-23,born early,230,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Positive Birth Story for pregnant ladies out there,"I have graduated at 39+6, baby boy was just 1 day short of the 40 weeks. My husband was joking that I was having all the conversations with my belly about showing up on time and not keep mommy waiting too long lol

It was a usual day for us, we went to Walmart around 3 PM to get more baby stuff ( masks and all with social distancing of course). I felt some cramping that made me sweat, I thought oh well it can’t be the baby yet. 

Once we got home around 8 Pm my cramps went from 3-4 to 8-9 pain wise. I started screaming scaring the living hell out of my partner. The hospital is right across the road for us so I get dressed and start waddling in the hospitals direction while breathing really hard and whimpering like crazy.

We made it to the hospital around 9 PM and got into maternity ward. The nurses said they would examine me and give me shot of Morphein and send me home due to COVID. 

In the examination room while I was waiting for the morphein pain killer, my contraction went from 8 to full 10. I was screaming like a mad woman and they finally showed up with the shot. The nurse checked my Cervix and it was 9 cm dilated, so they noped on the morpheine and transferred me to delivery room while I was screaming for epidural or anything. 

Around 11 PM I was hooked up to a laughing gas which made things a bit better and given an IV and fentanyl. The epidural was getting delayed and by the time anesthesiologist showed up my son’s head was already coming out. The doctor told me to push and after 3 pushes my baby boy came out screaming at 1 AM

I had a very minor tear and a few little stitches and was able to walk and take care of my sweetie right away :) 

Overall my labour took 5 hours with only 30 minutes of pushing and it’s my first child! Everyone out there kept telling me that my baby will be late and that it will be a super long excruciating labour as I’m a FTM. I’m here to tell you that it’s not true and it all between you and your baby :) 

We have a perfect baby boy who started sleeping through the night at 2.5 months and is a happy little guy no purple crying and any of those other things you get warned about :)

Hope this happy story helps to alleviate some of the anxieties out there as I was extremely scared to give birth and it turned out great!",342,36,2020-10-31,late delivery,453,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,I have/had an IUD pregnancy and need advice,"Update: hcg levels have dropped again to 67. I'm going back tomorrow to test again to ensure they keep falling now. Quite disappointed but guess it's not meant to be. Thank you to everyone for all your support and kind words. 



Hello, hoping someone can help put me out of my misery. My (33f) husband (46m) and I have two children and thought we were done. I have had the mirena IUD since our 2 year old was born. 

My last menstrual period was early-mid August, but a week after it ended I started spotting and have been since. Hubs and I had sex 28th August. This past Tuesday I woke with cramping that felt unusual, I thought something was wrong with my mirena but thought I would take a home pregnancy test to rule it out. Shock horror it was positive. Initially I was horrified,  thought my family was complete but have since come to believe if this ends up being viable we will be thrilled. 

Went to the hospital for bloods, hcg level was 99. Went back thursday and levels are 85. Which I think means this is unviable? I have to go back saturday for another test to see if they continue to fall. 

My question being, is this a definite miscarriage? Is a slight fall definitely a miscarriage? The spotty stopped yesterday and I feel fine otherwise. Is there a chance this could be visble or do i need to resign myself to this not happening? This is our last (surprise) shot as hubby just had a vasectomy a week ago (typical luck for us). 

Also will the iud need to be removed? 

And on the off chance this pregnancy continues, is removing the iud or leaving it in better medically? 

Thanks you if you've made it this far and for any advice you may have 😊",287,82,2020-09-18,born early,311,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,Mommy wars are stupid,"Making a separate post of the comment I posted on the formula feeding thread - because I feel this needs to be said.

All parents - but certainly childbearing and feeding parents - that’s mostly mothers - should organize as a political class. Our systems are so totally family unfriendly, that it’s absolutely counterproductive engaging in trivial judgmental ‘wars’ with each other instead of focussing our energies towards effecting systemic changes.

Mothers judging other mothers is a super wasteful use of our attentional and emotional resources. Getting hurt over ‘judgment’, calling other parents ‘toxic’, those are the petty battles. Just do what’s right for us, judgment be damned. So what if someone calls us a Bad Mom? Let’s do our best act and have confidence in our judgment, they don’t know what battles we’re going through.

For example, it you are in the US — and most posters on here probably are - your system makes you feel like you truly have a free choice between BF and FF and lets you fight it out over what’s ‘best’ - while actually not providing you with the resources to actually spend time figuring it out and making the best decision for you. 6 weeks or 12 weeks or whatever shitty leave you get is not good enough to establish a great breastfeeding relationship, especially if you have problems in the beginning. You should have access to LCs, mental health therapists, healthcare, nutritionists... whatever it is that helps you become better parents. Pumping at work should be a worst case scenario, not a routine that people should be expected to get used to to be more productive 🙄 

The same goes for all those parenting ‘wars’ - how the babies sleep, how they are fed, clothed, diapered and weaned.

I wish we’d have higher standards, and use our energies to demand better systemic improvements to benefit all parents. That’s - a minimum of a year paid leave for mothers or split between parents. When we have the paid time and bandwidth to spend with our kids, we can then decide with greatest latitude what is ‘best’ for our particular circumstances. Without that, we’re just so constrained by our circumstances that nothing is really objectively the ‘best’ and we are all just wasting our energies.

BabyBumps,Insurance companies that won’t let you order a pump until 30 days before your due date — you’re the worst!!,"I am fully insured through United. With my first baby, I could order my breast pump at any time once I had a pregnancy on my medical record, but I was with a different insurance company. United’s policy is that you can’t order more than 30 days before your due date and that, frankly, is bulllllllshit. 

I’m having my baby earlier than my due date due to it being a large baby, so that already cuts down my time. Even with a scheduled c section at 39 weeks on my records, United has told me they’ll deny my claim if I order early.

I know this isn’t a concern for all moms because of the variety of breastfeeding decisions, but my first relied heavily on pumped breast milk early on because of latching issues. It’s giving me so much stress to think my pump won’t arrive in time. 

Also, I’m filled with rage when I think about how this policy would impact moms of multiples and preemies — two groups who are likely to need pumps early on for the benefit of themselves and their babies if they want to pump or breastfeed. (Again, no judgment on breastfeeding vs. formula!!)

I had polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid), which is a classic side-effect of this syndrome, and caused my extremely premature labor. He had an omphalocele (intestines and liver were out in his umbilical sac because his abdominal wall didn't close - repaired at 8 months and now has an adorable constructed belly button), small ribcage, and just due to prematurity we dealt with: necrotizing enterocolitis, pulmonary hypertension, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, massive inguinal hernias, retinopathy of prematurity (he had laser surgery), kidney fungus (he had nephrostomy tubes filtering amphotericin b for 3 months), he was intubated for 6 months before receiving a trach (which caused subglottic stenosis), tracheomalacia, g-tube at 8 months, bowel resection due to the NEC (at 8 months... most babies don't survive that without immediate surgical intervention), and now hypertension. At 6 months, we had to transfer him 3 hours from home to a level 4 NICU for a good number of those surgeries... we lived there in Ronald McDonald House for 5 months before transferring him back to our hometown PICU. I've seen him turn purple more times than I can count, I've seen him receive chest compressions, he's been bagged absolute countless number of times, I've done emergency trach changes, and yet here we are... he's more stable than ever. We've been home for two weeks, no emergencies, just a happy baby. He has a trach, ventilator, and g-tube, and we have 24/7 nursing at home (supposed to, anyway... nights are not always covered).

BabyBumps,Why I'll never see another midwife,"My first child was born at 41 weeks. She was estimated to be 7 lbs and was born at 8lbs1oz. I had a natural unmedicated birth that ended in a 3rd degree tear and significant blood loss. It was horrific and traumatic for me. My recovery was significantly more difficult than any of my friends who had c sections. 

With this pregnancy, I have gestational diabetes. Baby has been consistently measuring large for gestational age. His size has been estimated 3x by ultrasound. His belly is measuring above the 99th percentile. I am terrified of delivering a large baby and have been begging for a c section.

My high risk doctor said I am not to go past 39 weeks because of the risk of my placenta failing. There are two midwives and two OBs at the regular practice I go to. One of the midwives told me that I absolutely could not have a c section unless the baby was measuring over 10 lbs. She also tried to convince me that I didn't have to listen to the high risk doctor and that I could go to 40 weeks. She didn't listen to any of my concerns.

On Monday at 36+6 I saw the second OB for the first time. At this point, baby is estimated at around 8 lbs. We went over the risks plus my fears and concerns. He recommended induction at 38+0 and felt it was the best option for me. He told me that I was free to wait until 39 weeks if I really wanted to and that he would recommend a c section at that point based on how my previous birth went, but he said that ultimately it was my decision. Now he is going to deliver my baby instead.

I saw the other midwife today, who I usually see, and she acted mad that the OB scheduled an induction for me at 38+0. She said she would have been ok with me going to 39 weeks. I told her that I was happy about the induction and explained why I thought it was a good idea. She still acted mad at him about it, said she would not have recommended that, and offered to reschedule my induction. I said no.

One of the midwives has completely ignored my concerns, the other has ignored my concerns and made potentially dangerous suggestions that go against what the high risk Dr said was necessary.

I will never again see another midwife. I'll be seeing this OB from here on out, including for my future annual visits. I have felt so ignored and like they didn't see me as an individual with individual medical history and needs.

I feel much safer and relieved now that I am having an early induction and am delivering with a dr who listens to me.",129,90,2020-07-17,gestational age,476,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,"Hopefully this helps anyone, preterm birth.","Hello,  while I’m currently not pregnant myself, I’ve seen A LOT of parents have worries (understandably) about preterm birth, survival or potential outcomes, so it feels right, being 22 now, to use my birth as a beacon of hope for parents in similar situations, as I see many survival stories, but none from adulthood/long term. 

I was born in 1998, at 24 weeks, weighing 1lb 5oz. When I was born, they thought I was dead. I had countless blood transfusions, bilateral grade 3 IVH (brain bleed), grade 3-4 are severe. Many times they tried to take me off of the ventilators so I could breathe, and I’d just end up crashing. My parents often walked in to them performing chest compressions. They told my parents that I’d be severely disabled, mentally retarded, unable to walk, talk, see or hear. They offered to take me off of life support. 

I’m here at 22 now, I have aspergers (which runs in my family) and ADD/anxiety (also genetic), and dyscalculia (maths dyslexia) That’s it. No movement issues at all, not even asthma. I’ve grown up around second hand smoke. Now, I know not every story is like mine, but the point is to never lose hope. In the eyes of the doctors, I shouldn’t be able to write any of this to you.

BabyBumps,Apparently I am being oversensitive & need to calm down - according to a man in my office.,"Okay, I need to rant really quick. I have this male coworker who thinks he knows everything. Since I announced I was pregnant (I am 18wks but just told work 2wks ago), he always has something to say. From""You shouldn't rub your belly because it will cause premature labor"" (Cue eye roll) or ""You really shouldn't have juice (I was drinking apple juice) because it is not good for the baby"" or, my favorite, ""Are you really eating again?"", as I am having some watermelon as a snack. 

Keep in mind, he is a 6'8 tall, 250lb MAN.....so yeah.

So today, I was talking to my coworker about some medical issue I THOUGHT I having, (turns out I am okay, but didn't know it at the time) &  while in her office and mid-sentence (almost in tears), he barges in, cuts me off & starts speaking to her about something else. When I said ""Okay, I guess I wasn't speaking..."" He said ""Oh you are always talking, stop being so oversensitive"". 

At that point, I walked out of the office. He said something while I was walking away then followed me to the kitchen, where I was attempting to compose myself, & he was saying in a joking tone how I am over sensitive. All his little comments over the past two weeks bubbled over & I just snapped & told him I was speaking to her about my medical issues, it was kind of important & I don't understand while he is always so rude to me - to that he repeated ""What medical issues, stop...you are so sensitive, calm down."" & walked out.

I am livid. I just know he is going to try & joke around later in the day about something to smooth things over, but this time, I am not going to allow it. 

WHY DO PEOPLE THINK IT IS OKAY TO SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THIS? 

This is going to be a long 6 months before maternity leave...Argh. Okay, rant over.

BabyBumps,Terrified FTM with expected super preemie,"TLDR: 27 weeks with an indefinite hospital stay and baby due to be delivered any time. 

I'm currently 27+6 and absolutely terrified. My pregnancy has brought on diabetes related kidney disease. Before pregnancy the kidneys were functioning in the high 90s and no concern at all. They've drastically gone downhill and are now functioning in the 20s.

I went to what I thought was just a routine appointment with a specialist about this last Tuesday and they discovered that my blood pressure had suddenly skyrocketed. I was given medication to bring it down but this didn't work and the doctor decided the best course of action would be to admit me.

I was told that I now also have pre eclampsia and will be staying in the hospital until the baby is born. The doctor said that mothers who are normal get to this stage and have to deliver within 7-14 days and expects me to deliver in less, when my body gives out. I've been given steroids to help develop baby's lungs. 

Baby was measuring slightly on the small side at around 800g on Wednesday and I'm so scared that I'm going to lose her. She was supposed to be my miracle after two losses this year. I'm doing everything I can to remain calm so my stress doesn't harm my BP but honestly it's a nightmare. I'm on a high observation ward where new mums are brought after having their lovely healthy baby and seeing them interacting and knowing that even if baby is delivered safely I won't have that with her as she'll be whisked away is just about killing me.

I don't know why I'm posting this, if I'm looking for advice or just needed to get this all off my chest but thank you so much if you managed to read the whole of my long ramble.",113,44,2020-12-28,preemie,312,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,We had an appointment today with the neonatologist at our NICU. Our baby has severe IUGR due to placental insufficiency. I thought I would share the questions we asked and the answers we were given incase it may help anyone else who is here preparing for a possible NICU stay.,"1. Gestational age VS gestational weight? Which is better as far as prognosis.

A: Gestational age is better, but low weight makes it more challenging. She doesn’t expect him to gain much more weight but she doesn’t really know. She has seen babies as small as 1 pound survive, she’s been a NICU doctor for 26 years. 

2. What would be a good goal weight/age to get to for the best prognosis?

A: A pound or a little more would be better than under a pound. 


3. What can we expect as far as ventilation, feedings, oxygen support, time in NICU, etc..?

A: Baby will likely need ventilation support, feedings will start very small and he will get a few drops of breast milk, if the feedings aren’t working they will switch him to intravenous feedings. Time in NICU will depend on how he is growing and any issues that arise and how well his lungs develop. 

4. What types of items would we need and which are provided? Clothes, formula, breast pumps, diapers, wipes? 

A: everything is provided, we can bring clothes when he gets a little bigger.

5. Are NICU babies in their own room like in an ICU or are they in a grouped area like in a nursery?

A: They are in pods of 3-4 babies

6. Are we allowed to stay? Are there visiting hours? Restrictions? 

A: Parents can visit 24/7, visitor restrictions due to Covid. 

7. If prognosis is very poor, he gets sicker than expected, and we feel complications will cause his quality of life to be very poor do we have the choice to end life saving measures in the NICU at any point? 

A: She was glad we asked this because it’s important to be realistic. They will do everything they can to help him but with any baby in the NICU there is a chance of something happening that would cause severe lifelong issues and poor quality of life, and if that happens then we as the parents have the right to end life saving measures. 

8. Are vaccines and the newborn screening for genetic issues such as sickle cell and cystic fibrosis still done on the same schedule as a full term baby? 

A: Vaccine schedule will be delayed but Newborn screening will occur on time, about 2-3 days after delivery.",84,22,2020-12-01,NICU stay,392,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,New pregnancy milestone: nearly breaking the toilet with a cement BM,"Fair warning, this is not a pretty story, if the title wasn’t a tip off. 

Last night around 8:45, after being constipated for 3 days (and taking 1 colace about 36 hours before - spoiler: it was not enough), I spent 20 minutes in the bathroom and had one of the most difficult BMs of my life, to say the least. If I can do that, childbirth should be nothing, right...?

Afterwards I went to cower on the couch, laying on my side to allow my backside to recover from that trauma. Little did I know...

About an hour later, 9:45, I returned to bathroom to get ready for bed. I opened the toilet lid to see what looked like some toilet paper that hadn’t gone down. I though, “no problem” and attempted to empty my bladder for the night (ha ha). When I went to flush however, it became clear that it was not just toilet paper - no, I had apparently butt-birthed a cement monster that absolutely refused to budge. 

I got out the plunger, to no avail. Our toilet has a weird bottom step so the plunger can’t make a seal. I tried to add hot water to the bowl - why? Desperate times, desperate measures? I kept trying to flush - the saving grace here was that the water was not overflowing. 

Eventually/slowly, all the TP went down, but the behemoth was still there, ignoring all my pleas for it to vacate the premises. As I continued to attempt the plunge and flush method, I imagined that it would just be our new pet and start pondering what we’d name it. 

I messaged my husband that I broke the toilet and we needed a new, bigger plunger and that I was moving permanently into the bathroom. He begged to help me but I refused - it’s not about the poop, or being embarrassed - I was just not about to be defeated by this thing. 

He advised me to get aggressive with the plunger, “like you’re stabbing a MF’er” you know, as you do. Which of course reminded me of the classic Reddit poop knife story... 

Husband had recently put an old, extra long shampoo pump into the trash (now I was grateful that I didn’t take it out and put it into the recycling). I grabbed that and started to use it to break up the lingerer, which took another 15 minutes and 6 more flushes to chip away at it enough for it to FINALLY go down the pipe. 

My husband again begged to help, I told him he could open the back door so I could immediately put the trash with the bastardized shampoo pump into the bin outside. And that he could sanitize the plunger and the entire bathroom in the morning. I finally emerged, triumphant, around 11pm (way past my bedtime).

After barely sleeping, haunted by my toilet nightmare, I have committed to reviewing my diet, eating more fiber and less mac and cheese and ice cream. And talking to my doctor about how much Colace I can safely take. And also buying a bigger plunger.",79,42,2020-12-15,pregnancy trauma,525,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,[Pediatric] my 13 month old started doing this spasm while eating. Normal or no? Should I try and see her doctor about it? [video link],"Sorry I’m advance for poor formatting, I’m on mobile.

— Now info possibly related to her problem she is totally obsessed with food and extremely impatient with it, so I feel like this is just caused from her frustration from impatiently awaiting the food. But this time she was eating herself, not me feeding her. She did it about three times during this meal and I finally managed to catch it on camera but she did it yesterday as well.

Should I be more concerned about these spasms?

EDIT: so I wanted to edit this with an update in case someone searches for something similar and comes across this post. So her doctor wanted to see her right away when I mentioned possible seizure (if you think your baby/toddler is having seizures you need to get them seen right away, Emergancy room in a good hospital and demand an EEG even!) luckily, once going to the doctor I had another longer and more detailed video than this video and the Dr. immediately told me she absolutely thinks this is just behavioral and that is because her eyes seem attentive and she doesn’t fall forward or cry and it is extremely short. she told me though that she has no issue with sending anything to a neurologist if something still seems off after today. Luckily she hasn’t done it again since the weekend. I feel extremely relieved now. Oh and she also said I can try and startle her while she does it and see if she reacts, because having a seizure, she wouldn’t be able to be startled or reactive to something quick like that. 

I’m so thankful for all the wonderful people who helped me on this post!",68,38,2020-06-27,premature baby,333,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Allow me to introduce ourselves,"Hi NICU mommas and daddies!

I am officially joining your ranks as of Tuesday. 

Back story: I was due July 8th with our sweet baby Olivia Joy. Last Friday, at 32 and 2, I had some vaginal bleeding. I had started BP meds on 5/12. I had had an OB appointment the same Friday morning and everything had looked good. When I got to triage, they determined the bleeding was nothing. But my BPS were off the charts and they had found protein in the urine. (Ah yes, we know where this is going - hello pre-eclampsia!) They told me that they wanted to monitor me for 24 hours and give me steroid shots to develop her lungs further. The next day they diagnosed and said to get comfy at the hospital and we were going to shoot for 37 weeks.  Monday, I had a scan and they decided Olivia needed to come sooner rather than later. She was measuring 3 pounds and 9 oz and in the 3rd percentile for her gestation and there was cord restriction. I was absolutely terrified and angry feeling like this was all my fault.  They induced me Monday afternoon. 

Tuesday, I labored all day. I had two failed epidurals and between Olivia distressing and me writhing in searing pain - I called for the c-section. It wasn’t worth it anymore. They got my husband suited up and took me back for the spinal tap (lol spoiler alert- it failed too. My spine is the worst). That meant, they were going to knock me out, which meant hubs couldn’t be in the room and see his daughter born. I sobbed as they laid me down. The day, HELL, week had already sucked enough. 

But then, at 7:02 pm, at 32 weeks and 6 days, Olivia Joy was born at 3 pounds and 3 ounces, 17.5 inches long and seriously, just  perfect. 

Since I was on magnesium sulfate, I wasn’t able to see her that night which broke every part of my soul. But I got to see and hold her the next day. And then began the NICU mom journey. 

She impressively was born and could sustain on room air. The CPAP was off before they left the OR. She is the embodiment of the Shakespeare quote,” Though she be but little, she is fierce.” 

She has been doing really well. They’re upping her feeds, she’s taking a pacifier, she’s starting NNS. I feel like she is an absolute rockstar for barely being a 33 weeker. She fluctuated below birth weight a bit this week but as of today is 3 pounds and 3.9 ounces. 

Today, I was discharged and I guess in my introduction, I ask for guidance on how not to fall apart each time you leave the hospital. It’s so hard to leave her. I have no idea when she will get out and all I can focus on is how I don’t get to take her with me. 

Anyway TL:DR. I have a barely 33 weeker, she is a rockstar but I am an emotional hot mess who is struggling to leave her baby after being discharged today and facing all the unknowns. 

Here’s a picture of my cutie 💗

NICUParents,Please know that the struggles you’re facing now will pass. You’re not alone.,"Hi everyone. I gave birth to my sweet baby boy on July 18th, 2019. He just turned 1. His birthday had sent me spiraling down memory lane. 

To all of you parents who are sitting in a rocking chair next to an isolette right now, feeing like time isn’t even moving anymore: it’s gets better. I cannot begin to imagine what it is like being the parent of a preemie in today’s world, as it is so vastly different from what it was a year ago when I was in your position. I know there are days where you hate everything and days where it feels like a dream. I know there are days where you pray to whatever god will listen, whether you believe in them or not. I know that the emotional toil that it takes to gets through every day can be crushing, but there are better days ahead. The day when you buckle your sweet baby into their car seat and walk out of those doors for the last time. The day when they start taking full feeds for bottle or breast. The days where you can pick them up without waiting for touch time. Those days will come. I don’t want to tell you that a year from now it will all be a distant memory because that didn’t hold true for me, but the experiences you’re going through now with your baby or babies will change you. It’ll bring out a fire inside of you like you’ve never known, and the only ones who truly know that feeling is the army of NICU parents behind you, supporting you however we can. 

To all of you parents approaching the first birthday: whatever feelings you’re feeling are valid. I myself have been a mess this month, reliving the memory of my weeks in antepartum and my sons birth. I know he is home and safe, but the grief cycle is real is and we’re all working past that sense of loss that I know a lot of us feel. While this is your baby’s first birthday, it really is a time to take care of yourself. Do what you need to to get through the day. If you’re happy, be happy. If you’re sad, be sad.

I joined here when my son was born and have posted a bit, mostly lurked, since. I started a virtual support group on Facebook for fellow preemie parents trying to navigate parenting a preemie, because it is so different than parenting full term, healthy babies. 

I wanted to share a photo of my son, Alexander. From 2 lbs to 20 lbs. He is amazing. He has some delays and we’re working on meeting milestones, but he is happy. He knows how to shake his head no when I try to give him something he doesn’t like. He laughs and laughs in the mornings when I go to get him from his crib. He so intently watches the world around him. He was worth every single moment of everything I went through.

NICUParents,Some perspective two years out,"Tonight I watched my husband tell my toddler ""Don't touch the buttons on the dishwasher!"" as he then scooped her into his arms and tickled her with his beard against her neck. And for a moment I felt a flashback to him holding her in the NICU, just 34+5, her little nasal feeding tube and various cords dangling everywhere, one FIFTH the size she is now. And I felt such immense gratitude. Gratitude that she's okay, and I'm okay, and we've got a chunky lil shorty who is sharp as a tack, babbling happily in English and Spanish, saying such clever things like ""La pelela es casa caca"" (the potty is poop house!)  Telling me that the very hungry caterpillar in her book  is ""grande y gorda como Mamá"" (big and fat like Mama) who happens to be pregnant with her sibling at the moment, a baby whom i like to joke is between 50 and 75 percent ""done on the inside"", depending on whether I deliver early again or full term this time. 

I know some situations are more complicated than others, and ours was a relatively short stay of just nine days in NICU, but the experience will stay with me for life. And I just want anyone else going through that unexpected journey at the moment to know that one day you'll have such a mundane moment that will bowl you over in such gratitude, and, in some ways, with enough time, you'll see that the weight was a gift.

Wishing you strength on your NICU journeys. ❤️",56,3,2020-10-21,full term birth,282,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,I never posted my birth story but there is something I wanted to warn you ladies about,"[Baby tax - 9 months out!](https://imgur.com/a/OFcU5wa)


So I had this little cutie back in February. I chose to be induced about a week before due date (gestational diabetes). Very slow dilating but strong contractions. And like with my first delivery, the epidural only numbed half my body. With my first, they simply replaced the epidural and it was fine after that. This time around, they apparently wanted to avoid having to replace it. So instead they injected other pain meds into my epidural. I'm pretty sure there were two different additional pain meds added and one was fentanyl. Still only numb on one side and feeling strong contractions, they then replaced the epidural almost immediately after pumping in all those extra pain meds. It helped the pain, but then I started to feel scary bad. My blood pressure was dropping super low so the nurse was pumping me with the fluids to bring it up. I had never felt so close to death. I felt like my body was shutting down; like I might just stop breathing at any moment. I was having ""the talk"" with myself mentally (you can't die, they need you! Stay awake!) It was terrifying. Slowly my blood pressure rose back up and other than shaking uncontrollably I was feeling better. Right before showtime the pain was back and although I was scared of side effects I agreed to more pain meds. It was fentanyl again, but this time I vomited almost immediately after. Then I had baby and felt everything! I screamed. I pooped. It was ugly and beautiful and I never felt more relief than I did holding him in my arms. I didn't get that experience with my first since he was 2 months premature and went straight to NICU. Anyway, just be careful with the pain meds. Don't suffer through the pain but don't let them overload you either. Best of luck to you all!",56,19,2020-11-29,premature birth,323,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,Mourning the third trimester I didn't have,"I delivered my son in August at 28 weeks. His original due date was Oct 28th. My delivery was entirely unexpected, I had had an easy and healthy pregnancy without a single sign that anything was wrong, until one day my boy just stopped moving. We went into L&D for an ultrasound and I was rushed into the OR, totally in shock and not understanding. 

So I made the mistake of revisiting my October BabyBumps group tonight and it was filled with people's positive birth stories with full-term or barely preemie babies, and it just filled me with so much sadness and I started sobbing. Every time I go to visit my son and have to see a proud happy mama being wheeled out of L&D with her nice healthy newborn, I cry. When I see pregnant women out in the grocery store...yep, that's right-- I cry.   

 I know it's no good to dwell on the could-have-beens but it's so hard not to. I can't help but think about how I'm ""supposed to be"" super pregnant right now, feeling my baby wiggle inside of me, looking for tips on getting him to drop...all that third trimester stuff. This was my first pregnancy and I was enjoying it, and it just ended 2/3 of the way through. I never even wore the majority of my maternity clothes. I never got to let my mom feel baby moving inside of me. My son is doing ok in the NICU and hopefully will be out shortly after his original due date. I love him so much and am so glad to have him....I just wish things had been different.",53,22,2020-10-10,full term birth,276,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Scared of giving birth knowing a lot of problems are ahead,"Hi new friends, I am 21 years old and 29 weeks pregnant with my little girl Lila. She is smaller than 3rd percentile, her intestines are outside her body, and one of her kidneys has cysts and has failed. The doctors said that, with each weekly appointment, they will be checking to see if they need to induce labor (because of her size), and they hope she can get to 32 weeks. Once she is born she will need surgery on her intestines almost immediately and I won't be able to see her for hours afterward. After surgery I won't be able to hold her for a while (the process of putting intestines back inside the body is kinda slow). 

Anyway, I am breathlessly sad that she is going to need me and I won't be able to hold her and let her know that I am there. I am scared that she will feel abandoned. And I have no idea how long the NICU stay will be. I was hoping that some of you guys could help me know what to expect so it doesn't feel like such a scary unknown.",52,11,2020-10-22,induced labor,192,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Worst doctors experience & emotional aftermath,"I went to a different OB than my regular one today due to them having better ultrasound equipment and my little girl being very stubborn. I was put into an 80° room and poked and prodded for over an hour and a half for the scan, which was fine but uncomfortable. The doctor seemed short but pleasant the whole time. 

As soon as we’re done, the doctor first makes a comment making fun of me for being sweaty. Then she starts going in on me about being overweight, and how I have sugar/high blood pressure. Which I do not, and she did not bother checking my labs or charts obviously as both have been tested and perfect. She then says it’s good that I was so sick in the first trimester and lost 40 lbs, and to keep it up. Then, she tells me that if my baby Is stillborn it’s my fault for being overweight and that I shouldn’t have gotten pregnant while overweight (I was told I was infertile, this was not a planned pregnancy) and that I better breastfeed to help me lose weight (I’m not, I have trauma regarding my breasts). She wraps up the conversation saying she hopes I keep this in mind before getting pregnant again. 

I had tears in my eyes, my husband is slack jawed at the audacity, and as soon as we got into the car I started bawling. I literally haven’t been able to stop crying and it’s been 5 hours. I’m hungry but I’m so disgusted with myself that my body is rejecting food. 

I’ve struggled with depression/anxiety this whole pregnancy and went through lots of trauma during it too. I’ve worked my ass off to try to have a healthy pregnancy, and btw my baby is PERFECT AND HEALTHY she even said so. I’m just so terrified of being an awful mom. Now I can’t shake the feeling that I’m already failing my baby and she’s gonna die because of me. 

I read the reviews on this office on google and they have 1 Star reviews for the same thing. They do this to all women, and they’re a high risk OB. If my normal OB (who is great) tries to send me there I will flat out refuse. 

Now I gotta try to recover the steps of my mental health. I had been doing better lately but feel like I’m at rock bottom again. I can’t get out of bed, I can’t eat, I can’t stop crying. 

I don’t know what to do. This has been the worst day of my pregnancy, during the worst year of my life.",46,20,2020-10-07,mental health during pregnancy,442,,,,,,,,,

Hello,

As the title states, wife is 1 week overdue. For some context, the baby was in breech a month ago, now our OBGYN said she can feel the head down, so she scheduled us for induction. The previous 2 weeks she conducted a membrane sweep.

&#x200B;

 We checked the hospital's reviews that we were scheduled to go to and they were awful. We called our OB about it and she said to go to our planned hospital through the ER saying ""the baby's activity had decreased"" and seeing if they would induce. We did that, and what they did discover that the baby was still in breech position and that we should have had a C section scheduled, the nurse told us they wouldn't induce because the baby's vitals were strong, and to call the OB the next day. I called the OB's emergency hotline and they didn't answer.

We need to get this baby out, it's a week and 2 days overdue and there are no signs of contractions. What should we do?

Edit: We told the OB we wanted a C section and we went to the hospital that she works at through the ER. At 8:06pm yesterday a healthy baby boy was delivered!!! Thank you all for your concern and advice.",41,23,2020-07-10,overdue,234,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,"Need to vent, but know ITA...","I’m a FTM due with a little baby girl at the end of November. Husband and I are over the moon, despite the difficulties of pregnancy during COVID, plus a scary false T21 positive on NIPT at 13 weeks. 

My sister-in-law (husband’s sis) was supposed to get married in May in Hawaii (we live in CA), but we all know how that turned out. I was supposed to be her MOH, and I was super pumped. 

Wedding has now been moved to... end of October. So, I will be 35 weeks and unable to fly out to Hawaii. Of course, I’m bummed. I’m so so happy for her, but I am sad and a little salty at this damn virus for messing everything up.  

The vent? My husband and his entire family (essentially my whole support system) will be gone. My mom lives far away and we have a tenuous relationship. Plus, my husband wants me to minimize my time with her, as she heightens my anxiety. Same thing with my aunt who lives in my area. So I will effectively be alone 4 weeks till my due date taking care of our 2 dogs (and I’m a bit worried the travelers will ask me to drive around and care for theirs as well). 

I am SO anxious about this. What if I go into premature labor? What if I end up being on bed rest or needing help? Meanwhile my husband and his family will be living it up in Hawaii at the Grand Wailea, sliding down water slides and going to luaus. I want them to have a good time and I don’t fault them, but I am SALTY. I requested (to my husband) that they don’t send me any pics of them all having fun, as it will likely only make me cry and feel lonely. I don’t mind wedding pics or videos, but vacation pics while I’m stuck at home?? No thanks. 

My husband is so upset at me for feeling this way. “Why do you have to look at it like that?? Why can’t you just be happy for everyone? You don’t HAVE to be upset about it.” I just want him to understand that I will be a little sad and lonely when my whole support system will be thousands of miles away when I am at the tail end of my pregnancy. 

Don’t get me wrong. I don’t begrudge my SIL, and I do want her to have the wedding of her dreams. I want my husband to be there for his little sister. But I am sad and scared and I will be a little salty that I have to be alone. I wish I could be a serene and selfless person who is only happy for them, but it’s really really hard. And now I feel like a spiteful bitch because of all this.

BabyBumps,Has anyone dealt with an extreme amount of stress / grief during early pregnancy?,"I will be 12 weeks pregnant tomorrow. A few weeks ago my MIL died after a long battle with cancer. It was awful, but we knew she was approaching the end of her life and she was very at peace with it so we were managing our grief pretty well. 

Last Sunday, my FIL wasn't answering his phone so we went over to his place to check on him, where we found him unresponsive. I did CPR but he was already dead. Suspected massive heart attack, but I know he really died of a broken heart. He died 17 days after his wife, meaning my husband and his sister lost both their parents less than three weeks apart.

My husband is devastated and my heart is absolutely broken for him. I adored his parents so I'm grieving them hard myself.

On top of all this, also during my first trimester: 


- My SIL (husband's sister), who was my 'pregnancy buddy' because she was 6 weeks ahead of me, had a miscarriage two days before her mom died. I've been grieving the loss of having our babies grow up 6 weeks apart 


- We discovered that my husband is a carrier for a very serious genetic condition. We found out last week that I'm NOT a carrier (small win!!) so the band will be fine on that front, but we've been stressing out about it for weeks


- My own mom (who has destroyed her pancreas with 20 years of heavy drinking) relapsed after 7 months sober the day of my 8-week ultrasound. I'm afraid she's going to drink herself to death. 


All of that baseline grief/worry probably isn't good for the baby, but I'm also concerned that the absolute trauma and horror of finding my dead FIL and having to perform CPR on him (I can still hear the sound of his ribs breaking under my hands) was enough of a shock to the system to hurt the baby.

Has anyone been through an absolutely horrible time during pregnancy and ended up with a happy, healthy baby at the end? I can find articles on the effects of general stress during pregnancy but this shit is next level.

And yes, I'll be looking for a grief counsellor for both myself and my husband this week. He's handling it as well as can be expected (and I think I'm doing pretty well too) but I have a history of depression and this feels like a recipe for PPD waiting to happen, so I want to get in front of it!",37,18,2020-08-17,pregnancy stress,429,,,,,,,,,

Thankfully it was a fast labor & he’s doing well but GOOD GOD. I only got to hold him for about 30 seconds before they took him away. Nothing is going the way I imagined. I cry every day. We live over an hour away & have to go home this Friday. I already feel like the worst mother for leaving him. Hubby keeps reminding me he’s in the best care possible but how do you guys deal with it all?? Has anyone else had to go home & visit when they can? We’re hoping to do visits every other day but it breaks my heart....",36,20,2020-07-13,preterm labor,154,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,6 months pregnant had an extreme fight with spouse,"-6 months pregnant
-living in Cali 
-160 pounds
-Caucasian 

Hello, I had an extreme fight with my spouse this morning. I ended up screaming top of my lungs and hyperventilating. I knew I had to remove myself from the situation so I left. The duration of me freaking out was probably 20 minutes. 

To explain why the fight happened is a long story but my spouse has become verbally abusive during my pregnancy. I know I have to address it. 

Will this cause a miscarriage or harm my baby? I can feel baby moving here and there after I removed myself from the situation. I am really scared I harmed my baby. 

Thank you",35,12,2020-11-02,stress during pregnancy,114,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Water broke at 27 weeks. Waiting to deliver preemie baby. What kinds of things do I need to prepare to bring a baby home from NICU when she’s ready?,My water broke and I started bleeding at 27 weeks. I’m in the hospital until I deliver.  The goal is to delay delivery until 34 weeks. What will I need for a preemie baby once she is ready to come home? What items are helpful? Are there specific diapers that work best? Bottles? Any preferred preemie clothing brands? This was a huge shock and I’m totally lost. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.,35,14,2020-09-17,preemie,73,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Rant/sorry,"Edit 3: Y'all have been incredible and I am so appreciative of all of you. To those who were hurt by my post - I am so sorry. It was never my intention. In a moment of weakness, I lashed out, and I am so sorry you were caught in the crossfire. To those who offered a different perspective - thank you for reminding me that no experience is the same, and that ""uneventful"" does not mean ""perfect."" To those who sat with me in the frustration and let me know it was okay to feel that way - thank you for being real.

Edit 2: thank you, everyone, for the responses. I have learned a lot and I am grateful for this supportive community. A couple things: 1. This was in no way meant to devalue or invalidate or diminish anyone's experience, and as one person pointed out, a short stay is not the same as having no problems. 2. There are always going to be insensitive people in the world who try to do exactly that. 3. We are incredibly blessed to have a great relationship to begin with - any instances of frustration at others' experiences is kept between ourselves, and we would never DREAM of calling someone out or anything. I just wanted to know that I was not the only person feeling that frustration. 4. I am so glad I joined this group - y'all are all incredibly special and wonderful people and I look forward to gaining more wisdom and perspective from people like you.

I know that the NICU experience is different for everyone, and I'm not here to gatekeep who can be considered a ""NICU parent"" because that's not my call.

But does anyone else get really frustrated by the ""[single-digit] days in the NICU and we're finally going home"" posts? Like, yes, I get it, you went to have your baby early and expected to go home with your baby shortly thereafter, and then were disappointed when you had to wait a week - and that's tough. But like...

My little girl was born 15 weeks early. She won't be coming home for another couple of MONTHS. And I live an hour and a half away. Part of me wants to yell ""GET A GRIP, you're going home after days, try weeks or months and then come talk to me.""

Anyone else with long-term NICU stays get that kind of frustration? Again, I'm not trying to downplay anyone's experience - that's not my place. Nor am I calling any one particular person out about this. I'm just tired, y'all.

Edit 1: thank you for all of the responses. I've read all your comments, but sleepy brain (thanks pumping schedule) says wait till later to respond. I'll at least say this - y'all are all incredible.",35,116,2020-08-15,born early,474,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,How do people hide/not know that they are pregnant??,"From week 5 on, I’ve been either gagging, throwing up, incapacitated from nausea, or nodding off. I’m now at week 11 and I’m concerned I will get fired and or my fiancé will just plain leave me. I feel as though I’ve suddenly contracted a severe illness that leaves me listless and bedridden with no energy to do anything except choke down saltines and whimper.

I’m so so so grateful to be able to work from home, to have a fiancé that cooks for me, to have conceived this masterful parasite that I assume is some kind of tiny Hulk?? 

But how does anyone ever manage to conceal their pregnancy? I’m so bloated sweaty and tired (also, constantly burping?), I truly can’t imagine walking around like everything is normal. I feel like even on the phone or video calls everyone is on to me. It’s still slightly too early to spill the beans, I can’t imagine needing to take this whole production out into the world.

NICUParents,Second time NICU parent. Baby boy was born at 37w+1 but is not feeding well or regulating his temperature. I just want answers. Why is our full term baby not thriving?,"I had just unsubscribed from this subreddit, thinking I’d never be back here again. But here we are. I don’t feel scared, just devastated and confused.

My daughter’s birth was traumatic, and she suffered a brain injury due to lack of oxygen. She was cooled for 72 hours and stayed in the NICU for 14 days. I was in the ICU for the first 7 of those days recovering from severe sepsis (I had chorioamnionitis resulting from an appendectomy at 34 weeks). So my husband had to experience the worst of her NICU stay. By the time I was discharged and able to visit her, she was off oxygen and almost out of the warmer. 

Now it’s my turn to be the main NICU parent, and it is grueling. It started off with a big scare at the pediatrician on day 3 of his life. He was being seen due to having lost 10% of his body weight. They checked his glucose and it was extremely low, so we walked over to the nursery immediately and got him admitted. Right off the bat he needed oxygen and an IV and his body temp was 93. It was so scary to watch this all happening so quickly.

Now he’s on day 5 of his life and still feeding him is like a race against time, as his awake periods are so short and his stamina is almost nothing. The nurse said he’s acting like a much more premature baby, even though he was technically full term. 

They thought maybe he had an infection, but so far all the tests are coming back negative. I’m just so confused as to why my perfect boy isn’t able to wake up and have lots of big meals and get big and strong. I know it’s only day 5, and lots of babies take a week to start putting weight back on. But most babies don’t need this much help. 

So I’m worried he has a huge developmental delay. Our daughter is in special ed due to a delay, possibly caused by her birth injury. I always thought our son would be given an easier start and not have to go through therapies and services and would be able to just be “normal”. But now I don’t know. I just want answers, I guess, and having a hard emotional day.",34,20,2020-05-21,full term birth,395,,,,,,,,,

I feel like in a weird way the bonding has shifted since she came home. Like I’m not as bonded. Is that just the sleep deprivation talking? I’ve not had much support from friends and family due to Covid restrictions and that really broke my heart. I have had a post partum doula come so I can sleep. My husband used up his paternity leave during the birth and right after so he can’t be home with me right now so it’s 90% all me.

I also have 5 other friends having babies and all of them have gone to term with their babies. I feel like I don’t know when my baby is going to be like theirs and so there is this odd dynamic of she older than all the other babies but behind them in development. 

I guess I just don’t know what to expect any more and I’m afraid to be happy because what if some wierd stress is right around the corner?

I’be also had a hard time physically recovering from pregnancy because of the stress of the pandemic and the NICU. My body feels way out of whack and I’m uncomfortable most days.

NICUParents,Feel like baby is languishing in NICU,"Hi all, long time lurker, first time poster. I feel like my 30 weeker is languishing in the NICU. We’re on Day 44. He’s been off the CPAP for about 2 weeks and is working on bottle/breast feeding. I’m in the NICU from roughly 8am to 7pm and breast feed twice a day (my supply is taking a hit from the prolonged stress I think. That and I can’t sleep- Im typing this at 4am). He still has an NG tube and has been progressing in his feeds, but it’s not linear at all- the first week he was POing 20 percent of his feeds, next week 40 percent, this week 50-70 percent. However this varies from day to day. I think the NG tube is probably contributing to his inability to finish his full feeds and events. He also just gets fatigued. He’s still having a lot of minor Brady’s and desats which he recovers from by himself, with some more “significant” ones thrown in. He did have a blood transfusion about two and a half weeks ago and his hemocrit is a little low but not at the point that they would transfuse again. 

Every day I am being told that he’s just “premature and needs to grow” and “every baby is different”. But I’m afraid I’m missing something and it’s causing his development to delay.

I’m at the end of my rope. I break down in tears multiple times a day. I’ve survived abuse, health crises, you name it, but this is breaking me. I’m crying as I type this. The NICU we’re at has good doctors and the nurses have been solid for the most part. I spend hours and hours reading about potential issues or ways to address them. The staff are responsive but I feel like they aren’t being proactive. And meanwhile time keeps rolling. It’s also not a great environment to be in day in and day out- it’s loud, overhead lights, I don’t have a lot of space to sit in, it’s incredibly hard to breastfeed. Yesterday I felt like I shouldn’t even go in for the next couple of days as maybe the nurses could get him to the point where he’s taking enough feeds by mouth so his NG tube could be pulled. But the idea of not seeing him for even a day makes me sick to my stomach. I need a “win” to keep going. Thanks for reading.",29,27,2020-07-16,premature baby,410,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,Gynecologists: is it standard procedure to pull down a woman’s cervix during labor?,"I had my baby a couple months ago and I was wondering if it’s standard procedure to pull on a woman’s cervix while she’s in labor? I was induced at 7am that day, the gyno came in 3 different times throughout the day to check on me. The first 2 times she couldn’t find my cervix and said it was pushed so far back, the third time she found it and PULLED IT DOWN. I screamed so loud. It was the worst pain I’ve ever been in in my life. It was worst than contractions, worst than the actual delivery. I get terrible flashbacks of that day and I’m scared to have any more kids because of it. 

I was speaking to an old friend earlier who works in the healthcare field and she told me that the gyno was really wrong for doing that and I should look into my rights.

Is she right? I really don’t know anything when it comes to that and I don’t know if she’s just saying that or if I could actually build a case around that. Just looking for a second opinion I guess.

BabyBumps,How careful are you being with COVID?,"Hi guys,

Like all of you, I'm trying to navigate these crazy quarantine times we're in with COVID-19.  Up until recently, we've been trying to social distance with our friends (who work in various public arenas, send their kids to day  care, etc.) by meeting outdoors and staying 6 feet apart. Now that it's getting cold, my husband and I are trying to figure out what's responsible as far as indoor gatherings go, which is up to 20x more risky as far as virus spread. 

Mostly our question is, do we ask everyone to wear a mask any time we see them indoors? It feels so awkward and also like it will lead to us not hanging out with people much this winter.

ANYWAY my question is, what are you doing with your closest friends? Masks at all times? No meetings at all? I need some guidance here. 

2 recent studies made us get a lot more serious about our distancing policies. The CDC showing COVID is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, miscarriage, and stillbirths. 

https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/covid-19-linked-to-preterm-deliveries-cdc-report-says/ar-BB197hDR?li=BBnb7Kz

Another study from JAMA done in London found that since covid, stillbirths have gone up 4x, even in babies with no birth defects. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768389

Not trying to scare anyone, just looking for a discussion on the recent studies and your thoughts moving forward into winter. Thanks! 🙂",26,34,2020-09-26,preterm birth,225,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,2nd time NICU parent,"My oldest son had a lymphatic malformation that was diagnosed in utero at 20 weeks. He was eventually delivered through an EXIT (intubated during delivery ) procedure at 35 weeks. He was in the NICU for 87 days before he was discharged with a tracheostomy and a feeding tube. He has had more surgeries than I can count.  He is now a teenager. He is going well, but will eventually need more orthodontic surgery. 

We were expecting a healthy baby boy last week. He was delivered at 37 weeks via c-section due to uterine scaring from my previous c-sections. I was not given steroids ahead of time. Despite being full term he suffered from respiratory distress syndrome (wimpy  white boy).  His lung partially collapsed, and he was air lifted to a hospital with a level 3 NICU. He is improving, and we are hoping to have him home for Christmas.  

COVID has complicated everything. The hospital only allows one parent at a time. There are no private restrooms, and no eating in the patient room. I'm 4 days postpartum, and I'm pumping. I can't drive yet, and people are constantly mask-less in the family waiting room. Even staff pull down their masks to talk on a regular basis. Not only are we concerned for our newborn, but our older son is on an immunosuppressant.

We got stuck at 9 cm. had an emergency c section and our boy was delivered at 12:30 Wednesday. Still positive and happy with how it went in the end x

I’m in the wide awake club. Had a gel induction at 2 pm yesterday (I’m 12 days over due day) Immediate contractions that got very strong very fast. Plans for a pool delivery were scrapped fairly quickly and I opted for an epidural. Best. Thing. Ever. I can feel everything ( like you can feel someone holding your had) but zero pain. Even the catheter going in. I can also move my legs, but no walking. But I don’t feel trapped and can try different positions when pushing time comes. After a breakdown due to being alone a lot at first, thanks anxiety, I’m now so chilled and happy.  Just waiting to be told I’m at 10 and it’s go time.

BabyBumps,Early labor is the worst tease (37+6 FTM),"Last Thursday I started having some contractions, very very slight, felt like a period cramp, only had 3 from Thursday until Sunday. Okay, cool, things are happening. 

I go to my appointment on Tuesday and my doctor says I’m 3 cm dilated and 60% effaced already!!! Yay! Things are happening! I’ve been spotting some old blood though since then which hasn’t been thrilling but otherwise feeling great. 

The rest of the day I felt a little weird and had a teeny bit of cramping, but yesterday morning I started having some contractions! Yay! I let my husband know to be on standby, and hop in the shower in case I start progressing faster. These were probably a 4/10, not bad. 

THEN EVERYTHING STOPPED. I GOT NOTHIN. 

Happened again at night, I lost a big chunk of mucus plug with some bright red blood in it after being on my yoga ball all day and going for a walk, and this time my back hurt SO BAD, hopped in the shower again and went to bed. 

NOW NOTHING.

NICUParents,NICU bound,"My wife is 28+5 and we have been told our baby is in the 1st percentile, weighing in at around 800g, with no amniotic fluid as highlighted at the 28 weeks scan (scan on week 23 was fine).

We're scared now because blood flow is good so the consultants are entertaining possible genetic/chromosomal issues.

The challenge we have is running the risk of inducing early delivery (and everything that comes with that) by testing for chromosomal abnormalities via invasive methods. What do we do? It's such a difficult decision to make because if we found that the baby had serious conditions that would limit quality of life we would have a difficult decision to make. If we don't, we don't.

**Update 3rd December**: we got viral tests back to confirm they aren't the cause of the small size. Following that we made the decision to undergo the CVS test. This is going to be the longest 2 weeks of our lives!",22,21,2020-11-27,early delivery,161,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,The hospital I've been going to is forcing all of the women to be induced at 39 weeks and I was wondering if this is normal?,"I'm currently 21 weeks pregnant and the hospital/OBGYN I've been seeing has made it a ""rule"" now that all women are to be induced at 39 weeks. I don't know if this is COVID related or if it has more to do with the fact that the OB department is severely lacking staff at this hospital and they just want things to be scheduled out. 



I'm not sure how I feel about this though regardless of what their reasoning is, I'm not super gung-ho on ""everything has to be natural"" philosophy but I do feel like it's just unnecessary and that a baby will make their arrival when they're ready. Unless I had some medical issue where they had to induce or went a week or more past my due date, I get it. But to just say ""you have no choice over how you birth"" seems really...wrong. By the time I'm full term I'll have an 18 month old and I'd rather labor at home for as long as possible so we're not gone from her very long and I have no idea what their covid response will be to having her come after the baby arrives. 


The next closest hospital is an hour away and I haven't called them yet to see what their policies are but I definitely plan on it. I just don't like them being so far either...I don't know I guess this is sort of a rant but what would your thoughts be on this and induction in general?",22,31,2020-08-20,full term birth,255,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,My full term baby developed breathing issues due to fluid in his lungs a few days after birth,"My baby was born 9/22 at 39 weeks 1 day.  He had a low heart rate and a low body temperature at birth, so he was taken to the NICU to be put under the warmer and to be evaluated for cardiac issues.  I have a genetic cardiac condition, so it was upsetting but not surprising to discover that he has it too.  He was put on proper medication and his heart rate went up and his body temperature became stable as well.  

We were preparing for him so be discharged when his oxygen saturation started taking alarming dips.  They did a chest X-ray on him and discovered that he had fluid in his lungs.  He was put on oxygen and will now need to stay a few extra days to clear out his lungs and get weaned off of oxygen.

I’ve heard of TTN, but from what I understand, it presents itself almost immediately after birth.  The doctors don’t fully understand why his issue didn’t start until about 3 days after birth.  I’m so grateful that we were already in the right place for him to get treatment when they caught it and that he was not discharged too soon, but I can’t help but worry about him.  The doctors haven’t actually used the term TTN to describe his condition, so there may be something different going on.

BabyBumps,"Unsupportive, uninterested husband","Hello everyone. This is my first time posting on this sub. I’m a first time mom (26F) who is 23 weeks pregnant with my first baby due in September! I’m really excited about the baby and my pregnancy but I don’t think my husband (32M) feels the same and I was hoping to get some advice/support. 



Ever since I’ve gotten pregnant, he seems to have lost interest in me / the baby. We haven’t done anything “date-like” for months and haven’t had any physical intimacy since February. He doesn’t make an effort to spend time with me or even talk to me despite my bringing it to his attention. I’ve asked him many times if we can hang out and spend time together and I just get excuses (I’m busy, I’m tired, after my test we will hang out etc.). What bugs me is that he spends hours talking to his mom and brother on the phone and he spends sooo much time watching YouTube videos or reading stuff online related to technology and his other hobbies. Despite this, he hasn’t done much research on baby-related things and has made minimal effort to emotionally support me during my pregnancy.  He’s felt the baby kick 3 times and I have to insist he comes and feels my belly and once he feels the baby move he goes away and does something else. He hasn’t made much effort to make sure I’m doing ok and am not lonely even though I specifically moved in with him so he wouldn’t miss pregnancy milestones and so I could have support during the stay at home directive. I lived alone near the University I attend prior to moving in with him so being able to spend time with another person during the stay at home directive was supposed to help me not be lonely and stir crazy.



He knows it’s a concern of mine because I keep bringing it up and I’ve cried a bunch of times over feeling lonely. I’m at a loss of what to do since bringing it up doesn’t help. With the stay at home order still in place in our state, I can’t see my friends. My family lives a flight away so I can’t see them either. I’ve been doing my best to keep in touch with people virtually but it’s not the same as spending time together in real life. 



Has anyone else gone through a similar situation? How did you deal with it / cope? Would you recommend I join some new mom groups on Facebook to find more support?

NICUParents,UPDATE POST: Our IUGR Peanut,"Hello all,

Posted about 6 months ago that we found out about our little peanut's IUGR diagnosis at 24+6.

So, a quick rundown: wife went into full on preeclampsia 6 weeks later, BP peaked at 190/110 and she was admitted for the week prior to birth. Her condition reached critical mass and at the end of January, our little one made her grand entrance via emergency C-section, weighing in at only 1lb 14 oz.

Baby quickly established herself as top dog on the NICU, with everyone involved in her care remarking at how feisty and full of life she was, even at such a premature age.

We were absolutely thrilled to find out her growth restriction was ""asymmetric"" and that her brain and other vital organs were where they should be developmentally. In addition, none of the other abnormalities or deficiencies we had feared for based upon initial findings were present. Besides being tiny, she is perfectly healthy aside from a little reflux. We are immeasurably blessed.

After 83 grueling days, our little one came home. She's been home almost 3 months and is now over 10 lbs. She is still on the small side for her weight, but her development and milestones are in line with her age. She loves laughing, smiling, and playing with her toys. She has begun to find her voice and her stubborn personality continues to shine through. 😉

I haven't commented here much (only lurked) since that original post, but I'm thankful for all of the positivity and support here.

To the parents facing this now: you are strong and you are awesome, and so is your baby. Not everyone gets the unique privilege of being a NICU parent. This trial will be testing, but it will eventually end, and your baby WILL come home. I'm so proud to be a NICU dad, and the growth I experienced both personally and with my wife as a couple has been invaluable.

Stay strong. ✌",20,1,2020-07-09,premature birth,329,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Appropriate growth curves?,"What growth curves did your pediatrician follow after you left the NICU? Our pediatrician was tracking our 26 weeker on a normal full term baby curve based on his adjusted age and he was doing fine. Then today she showed us a different curve, one that is specific to premature babies born at various completed gestational months and his percentiles have suddenly increased. Basically the difference between the two is that this one tracks him against other preterm male babies. Technically he should be on a curve that starts at -3 months (born 3 months before due date), but the one she had started at -2 months. Presumably this curve merges with the full term baby curve at some point?",19,13,2020-06-08,gestational age,120,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,"I would like to know, from experienced moms how much more painful was being induced vs going into labor naturally?","Basically the above. I'm 40+3 and baby is showing no signs of going anywhere. I'm sure my doctor is going to schedule an induction date tomorrow, i'm a FTM so I have no idea what to expect. Honestly everything involved just sounds more painful than it should. I would love to hear your comparisons if you have had it happen both ways.

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your responses, I read them all this morning before my appointment and didn't get a chance to respond to everyone. We are having a scheduled C-Section. My doctor said that I am not dilating, contracting or showing any signs of intending to actually have a baby (oh my that would happen to me ha ha), he isn't dropping or cooperating on his side, and he, while being head down, is facing the wrong way. She said that at this point she feels the Section would be safer for him than struggling for several days to get me/him ready and in position to deliver.",18,20,2020-06-23,induced labor,170,,,,,,,,,
PregnancyUK,Waiting rooms,"Well, I arrived for my 2.45 consultant appointment; had my blood pressure taken; gave them some pee; and then sat down in the waiting room (which is FULL of women today). It's now roughly 3.45 and still waiting. 

The propaganda screen is on. 

Pick your poison, are you:

sleeping wrong?

feeding wrong?

eating wrong?

living wrong?

leaving your DIY too late?

The list is almost endless. Oh, and there's an advert about how two MEN decided that stretch marks were an unacceptable side effect of pregnancy, so they fixed it! Form an orderly queue to worship them, ladies, and to buy their expensive miracle band! And don't forget the day gel and night cream. As if it would work without those equally expensive additions!

I. Am. So. BORED!!!!!!!!!!!

Edit: I eventually found a nurse to ask & it turned out they had managed to skip my turn and put everyone else ahead of me. After being assured I was definitely next, I STILL ended up waiting till around 5pm to be seen. 

At that point, she berated me for coming in at all, instead of having a phone consultation. I tried to explain that I hadn't seen anyone since 12 weeks, so I wanted to see someone in person. Foolishly thought she might ask SOMETHING or ANYTHING about me or the baby/pregnancy so far. She did not. Asked me what kind of birth I wanted. I said preferably VBAC. She handed me a load of literature on elective c-sections and explained when the surgery would happen, if I chose to go that route.

Also! Got berated by TWO different people for not having my blue card?! I wasn't seen at 16 weeks, so I was never given a fucking blue card or polywallet!!! 

Came out totally deflated and desperately trying not to cry. And considering they found blood AND ketones in my pee sample, it seems fairly reasonable that I went down there in person?!

AskDocs,"Our unborn daughter 24 weeks has been diagnosed with CDH (congenital diaphragmatic hernie) on the left side, with liver, stomach, bowel and some gut up in her chest pushing the heart and lungs to the right side. U.K . Any advice would be greatly appreciated we are very scared.","My wife (F27) is 24 weeks pregnant with our second pregnancy (miscarriage at Christmas for unknown reasons). 

The 20 week scan revelled that the liver, stomach, bowel and some gut are sitting in her chest, I won’t go into detail of explaining what CDH is as I’m sure you’re aware and mobile device format is horrible.

They believe the hole is on the left side and have been unable to see the lungs as she’s always in an awkward position (little wriggler)

We decided to go ahead with the amniocentesis and the results came back normal on both. 

Everything is perfectly normal and healthy just that we can’t see the lungs yet and can’t accurately measure the waist due to the stomach being in the wrong place.

Our team has told us it is on the more severe side but still a 50/50 chance as there isn’t much telling until she arrives.

We are very upset but trying to remain calm and positive, my wife is the most amazing, brave, beautiful soul so I am seeking some extra advice from across the globe, in the U.K we have limited research and studies. 

Our options are ECMO if she manages to respond well to the respirator and her lungs work with taking in oxygen and breathing out CM until she is strong enough for surgery to bring the organs down and place a patch of the required.

We also have an alternative procedure with balloons in the lungs before pregnancy to help her to swallow and build up strength, but comes with risk of premature labour which is not ideal as she needs to remain there to give her the best chance. 

Another problem that comes with that is our specialist teams around the country aren’t trained in how to remove the balloons and sometimes they become matted(this is what we are told) as the procedure is done privately not NHS

If I have missed anything I will edit everything is very foggy atm but we have got this and so much support from the wonderful team at the hospital.

AskDocs,Calling all pediatricians in all specialties!!!,"13 almost 14 month female current weight 23lbs height 31inches. I realize not all of these details may be relevant but at this point I don't know. Does anyone have any idea? I have posted about this before and got an answer but I just need other opinions.


Pregnancy 

Smoked cigarettes and quit by the end of first trimester

Medications taken: buspirone,Zofran, occasional tylenol, and unisom for nausea 

19 weeks had stomach flu

20 weeks fell

23 weeks car accident

High blood pressure last month of pregnancy. Not pre-eclampsia 


Labor and Delivery 

Induced at 39 weeks 4 days with cytotec and pitocin (elective induction/ was not informed of dangers of induction and was told it was as safe as spontaneous labor) 

Fetal heart rate had numerous and drastic decelerations throughout labor and undetected during delivery

Scalp monitor was placed and found no heartbeat

No epidural and Unassisted delivery

Violet's health history 

Born 5lbs 14oz, 19.75 inches, head circumference 13 inches.

Good APGAR score (8 I think)

Lethargic after a couple hours, low sugar, low temp, high bilirubin 

Spent time under warmer, given formula

Released next day/ no NICU time

Dairy and soy sensitivity that she may have now outgrown

Torticollis diagnosis at 7 weeks that was resolved with physical therapy 

Plagiocephaly that we got a helmet for but also mostly resolved with little to almost no helmet use

Frequent choking starting second night home in sleep. Was told by pediatrician it is normal and to keep a bulb aspirator next to her in case of choking

Choking worsens with feeding and we think it is because of a fast and forceful let down

Before 2 months has a few projectile vomiting episodes and frequent spit up

At about 3  months we are referred to a gastroenterologist who orders a swallow study

Swallow study shows no aspiration and that she has reflux but she still has very frequent choking with wet breath sounds (swallow study took less than 2 minutes and the radiologist complained about having to be there)

We started her on famotidine which seemed to help at first but quickly stopped helping. We upped the dose as directed but saw little improvement 

Starting at 6 months she has seizure like movements that we recorded and brought to pediatrician.

Referred to neurologist 

Did 48 hour EEG that showed no seizure activity

We got no official diagnosis but they guessed sandifer syndrome 

Eventually stopped these movements 

Since she was still frequently choking during and after eating, drinking, and during her sleep her gastroenterologist suggested an EGD and PH probe

Everything from these came back completely normal (which means no reflux)

We have now been referred to pulmonary doctor. Not sure why.

Current symptoms 

Chokes on most liquids but not as much while nursing

Chokes on a lot of foods

Wakes from sleep choking and gasping after making loud gulping sounds. Like she is trying to swallow but cannot 

Chokes at random times while awake and not eating or drinking 

When drinking from a bottle (which isn't often bow as she is 13 months) she audibly breathes loudly and takes frequent breaks to catch her breath

Snores sometimes 

Edit: Are there specific questions I should be asking or test I should request? Should I take her to a different kind of doctor and if so what? (ENT is already on our radar) Besides this she is right where she should be developmentally.

Edit again: she also has hiccups constantly",18,40,2020-11-21,induced labor,577,,,,,,,,,

It's a long and not so pleasant story but we re both recovering well now. 

Labour started with irregular contractions on Monday the 2nd of November and I rang the birth centre to be told to wait until they were more regular, eventually went in and I was struggling with the pain to be told I was only 1cm. They checked my blood pressure and it was a bit high but got it down so was allowed to go home.

Got to 4.30 am on Wednesday and my front waters had gone so off we went to the birth centre and I wasn't much further along but my blood pressure was too high, so I had 3 hours on the maternity ward alone to monitor me and baby before my husband was allowed to visit. 
The plan was then I d get induced by pessary  if I got to 24 hours without much progression. Problem was the delivery suite was dangerously busy so those 24 hours came and went with no pessary and all this time I was on and off the monitors so couldn't leave my bed much.
I eventually insisted on being checked in the early hours of Friday morning to be told I was 3cm and wouldn't get a pessary after all and was on the top of the list to go to delivery suite, it got to 4pm and finally got to go to delivery suite.
The midwife then broke my hind waters which still hadn't gone but I hadn't progressed much from that so they gave me an hour and then I got put on the drip which meant staying on the bed got monitoring.
 I then had gas and air and dont remember much of the next 6 hours until there were 3 midwifes and my husband coaching me to push, 75 minutes later after a tear and an episeotomy baby Jack was born at 11:05pm and was 9lb 15oz. 

Unfortunately his breathing wasn't great and turns out he had sepsis so he got taken to nicu quickly after a quick bottle whilst I got stiched up. After antibiotics and a short stint with an NG tube, you would never know what happened and he came to the ward with me after 3 nights. 
And then I ended up with sepsis myself so had to be isolated for a few hours whilst they rushed my covid test to be sure it wasn't that and also have an iron deficiency so have two infusions for that on top of the strong antibiotics.

It wasnt the experience we wanted at all and it was clear the staff were very overworked so a few things didn't go as they should but after some time processing it I m grateful that we re both alive and for the midwifes talking me down when I was in tears alone threatening to leave the hospital.",17,3,2020-11-19,NICU stay,527,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,Grief and stress through pregnancy (family related),"I've had a difficult pregnancy so far, following a loss last year at 7 weeks. I've had a few bouts of spotting and at every point have prepared myself for the worst. I've been a ball of nerves and just this afternoon, had a wonderful 16 week scan where our beautiful baby did every text book move. Sucked it's thumb, covered its face, stretched, rolled over - we heard the heartbeat and the sonographer said everything looked great.

I got home and received a call from my mother, telling me my father has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and has 3-6 months left.

I am in shock. I don't really know how to feel. I assume I'll react properly over the next few days, when it all sinks in. I just keep getting a bit weepy. I'm worried about my father, my mother, everything. 

In addition, I'm so worried about the impact this could have on the baby. I'm terrified of going into premature labour or something else will happen as a result.

Realistically I know what the answer is, but I really need some reassurance right now. Has anybody dealt with anything similar? Can extreme stress cause issues with baby?",17,17,2020-09-28,pregnancy stress,201,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately his breathing wasn't great and turns out he had sepsis so he got taken to nicu quickly after a quick bottle whilst I got stiched up. After antibiotics and a short stint with an NG tube, you would never know what happened and he came to the ward with me after 3 nights. 
And then I ended up with sepsis myself so had to be isolated for a few hours whilst they rushed my covid test to be sure it wasn't that and also have an iron deficiency so have two infusions for that on top of the strong antibiotics.

BabyBumps,Pregnancy depression,"I’m 25 weeks and have started having massive episodes of depression. Crying for hours about very minor things or nothing at all. I don’t necessarily feel suicidal but just feel no purpose or motivation and feel overwhelmed constantly. I have a history of anxiety but not so much depression except for after my first pregnancy. 

I feel so guilty for feeling this way when I’m blessed with a healthy pregnancy. It makes me beat myself up more. I’m physically miserable and drained...but no more than I have been this whole time. The feeling like I have so much longer to go just makes me feel hopeless. 

Boyfriend tries to understand but he’s not an emotional person as it is so it’s hard for him. 

All the doctors offices are closed until Monday so I guess I’m stuck through the weekend regardless. I’m just not sure if I should call my primary or OB or a try to look into therapy. My OB honestly doesn’t give me the warm fuzzies when we talked about my anxiety so I’m a little worried about this subject with her. 

I guess any advice or similar experiences would be helpful or maybe I just needed to vent. :/",17,14,2020-05-02,pregnancy depression,203,,,,,,,,,

PregnancyUK,Spent most of my midwife appointment in tears due to the ridiculousness of how badly pre and post-natal services are being handled.,"EDIT - From responses it seems that my issues are localised to my own county. I don't want to alarm anyone with this rant ❤️

I'm so sorry, this is way more of a rant than I wanted but jesus I needed to get it off my chest after my appointment this morning. 

My midwife, bless her, was apologetic and understanding, but couldn't offer any advice and just kept saying 'I know, it's terrible. I've got so many other ladies in the same position'.

So they're no longer doing anything with regards to 'big babies'. Whether that's a local trust thing or nationwide, I don't know. But if you have GD and your baby is soaring up the percentiles? Good luck in delivering that huge baby at full term. Narrow hips or a history of struggling to deliver a previously large child? Yeah. You'll just have to have a c-section, you won't be given an option to be induced early for a chance of a vaginal birth.

In my case.. High risk because of a major arterial bleed? An artery that has been reccomended shouldnt be under the pressure of birthing a child larger than 8lbs? WHELP. Guess we'll just have to test the waters and hope it doesn't burst during childbirth! Or I'll have a c-section. That's already very high risk because of major abdominal surgery performed in order to fix aforementioned arterial bleed. Highly advised against by multiple obgyn and surgical teams. 

Guys I am PISSED. My obstetrics team isn't getting back to me until the 28th of January.. Bang on 37 weeks. I have no birth plan, no guidance, no reassurances that they even know how to approach my birth considering the very strict rules they were given by my surgical team for my first pregnancy.


As a side note, she asked me how my physio was going. This was the first point I burst into tears because I have severe SPD and I had one appointment 24 weeks in and was diagnosed so late they couldn't do anything to improve the pain - just slow the rate it worsens. Well, my follow up appointment was cancelled and I was offered phonecalls. Haven't had a single one since. 

Oh, and they've all but shut down all the post natal midwife services because they don't have the staff. So those checkups you get in the days after you give birth? Noooope.

NICUParents,NICU/birth PTSD?,"Hi all. I am wondering if it is possible to get PTSD from a tramautic/early birth and nicu stay. A little info: I gave birth at 28+2 due to severe pre-eclampsia. There were complications during delivery and I was under general anesthesia. Baby had to be resuscitated but ultimately did OK. She spent 70 days in the nicu, all the while I was listening to alarms conserned about her breathing. Finally got her home two weeks ago. I'm obsessed with her breathing and always think she's going to stop. I have had a repeating nightmare that prevents me from sleeping. Basically the dream is that she is in the bed with me and I lose her in the blankets and she suffocates. I have woken up screaming. (FYI she sleeps in the crib or bassinet never in our bed). I'm wondering if this could be something serious like ptsd or ppd. Should I see a Healthcare professional? Any advice is welcome. Thanks.",16,15,2020-09-28,early delivery,162,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Denied VBAC,"I had my daughter at 26 weeks due to complications from severe preeclampsia. She was IUGR and spent 137 days in the NICU. I was told by all the docs that I should wait to get pregnant again until my daughter was 18 months. They said to lose the weight. They said to get my BP down. I did ALL those things. 

Two weeks ago I found out I was pregnant. I had my first appt today and was told that I am not a good candidate for a VBAC because of the J incision that was made with my daughter....I am so completely, utterly devastated . I cannot describe how upset I am. It took everything in me to not fall out in the doctor's office. 

I feel like I have failed as a woman and a mother. I am ashamed that my body could not figure out how to work properly. I feel like I have failed my daughter by not being able to give birth to her vaginally or at full term. All I wanted was to be able to do it right...to redeem myself...and I was told no. I am so heartbroken.

I know ultimately that it is because they want me and my unborn baby to be safe...I know I am being 100% selfish. I am even thinking about going against my best interest and just asking them to 'let me try'. 

Have any of you experienced something like this? What are your stories? Please...I need some advice...and badly.",16,20,2020-11-11,full term birth,254,,,,,,,,,

PregnancyUK,"NHS birth story, vaginal birth with a drip induction","Reading some peoples birth stories where it didn't quite go to plan helped me when I was pregnant so I thought I d share mine a little late, it's still a bit traumatic for me but maybe this will help other mums
It's a long and not so pleasant story but we re both recovering well now. 

Labour started with irregular contractions on Monday the 2nd of November and I rang the birth centre to be told to wait until they were more regular, eventually went in and I was struggling with the pain to be told I was only 1cm. They checked my blood pressure and it was a bit high but got it down so was allowed to go home.

Got to 4.30 am on Wednesday and my front waters had gone so off we went to the birth centre and I wasn't much further along but my blood pressure was too high, so I had 3 hours on the maternity ward alone to monitor me and baby before my husband was allowed to visit. 
The plan was then I d get induced by pessary  if I got to 24 hours without much progression. Problem was the delivery suite was dangerously busy so those 24 hours came and went with no pessary and all this time I was on and off the monitors so couldn't leave my bed much.
I eventually insisted on being checked in the early hours of Friday morning to be told I was 3cm and wouldn't get a pessary after all and was on the top of the list to go to delivery suite, it got to 4pm and finally got to go to delivery suite.
The midwife then broke my hind waters which still hadn't gone but I hadn't progressed much from that so they gave me an hour and then I got put on the drip which meant staying on the bed got monitoring.
 I then had gas and air and dont remember much of the next 6 hours until there were 3 midwifes and my husband coaching me to push, 75 minutes later after a tear and an episeotomy baby Jack was born at 11:05pm and was 9lb 15oz.

PregnancyUK,Waiting rooms,"Well, I arrived for my 2.45 consultant appointment; had my blood pressure taken; gave them some pee; and then sat down in the waiting room (which is FULL of women today). It's now roughly 3.45 and still waiting. 

The propaganda screen is on. 

Pick your poison, are you:

sleeping wrong?

feeding wrong?

eating wrong?

living wrong?

leaving your DIY too late?

The list is almost endless. Oh, and there's an advert about how two MEN decided that stretch marks were an unacceptable side effect of pregnancy, so they fixed it! Form an orderly queue to worship them, ladies, and to buy their expensive miracle band! And don't forget the day gel and night cream. As if it would work without those equally expensive additions!

I. Am. So. BORED!!!!!!!!!!!

Edit: I eventually found a nurse to ask & it turned out they had managed to skip my turn and put everyone else ahead of me. After being assured I was definitely next, I STILL ended up waiting till around 5pm to be seen. 

At that point, she berated me for coming in at all, instead of having a phone consultation. I tried to explain that I hadn't seen anyone since 12 weeks, so I wanted to see someone in person. Foolishly thought she might ask SOMETHING or ANYTHING about me or the baby/pregnancy so far. She did not. Asked me what kind of birth I wanted. I said preferably VBAC. She handed me a load of literature on elective c-sections and explained when the surgery would happen, if I chose to go that route.

Also! Got berated by TWO different people for not having my blue card?! I wasn't seen at 16 weeks, so I was never given a fucking blue card or polywallet!!! 

Came out totally deflated and desperately trying not to cry. And considering they found blood AND ketones in my pee sample, it seems fairly reasonable that I went down there in person?!

AskDocs,Bleeding for a month - 22F,"

Hey..I’m 22F, 110 lbs, 5 ft 2, i take the mini pill and 150 mg of lamotrigine daily (bipolar disorder). I’d really like to know what could be wrong with me? I have been bleeding for a month straight now. The bleeding started as lighter than usual, it was pinkish, then it turned bright red, then brown, then back to bright red, brown again, and now it’s brighter red again. It’s been 31 days that this has been going on. I saw a doctor through my university a couple weeks ago and they tested me for STDs, those tests were negative. Took a home pregnancy test and also got tested during that appointment, both negative. She told me to wait it out and said she thinks it’s probably not anything serious. She told me to contact her in early January if I’m still bleeding and she might have to refer me to a specialist. I decided to set up an appointment with a gynecologist on my own, but there were no appointments until the second week of January. I don’t have big clots or anything, but the bleeding just doesn’t seem to be getting lighter, sometimes it feels like it’s getting slightly heavier (compared to my regular period the flow seems light-regular, it’s not the amount of blood that’s scaring me, it’s how long it’s been going on). What could be wrong with me?

I’m not having any extreme pains. Maybe light-mild cramping every now and then, but it isn’t constant. Had a migraine the other day which I sometimes get before the start of my period. This all started around the time I was supposed to get my period, and according to my period tracking app..right now is around the time I’d be getting my period again. But there was no break in the bleeding in between. 

I take the mini pill!!! Progesterone only! I started this pill THREE years ago and have been taking it daily ever since.

BabyBumps,How do you deal with possible depression over an unintended pregnancy?,"Before I say anything, just be aware that yes, I AM safe and in contact with my doctors about everything!

So, I might be pregnant. While I've always wanted to be a mom, now is just not the right time. 20 years old, about to move into my first apartment, new job, it's all very stressful. I am pro-choice and pro adoption, but trust me when I say that those are not options for me. When I get my blood test on Monday, if it's positive, I'm raising a baby.

I have depression though, and this pregnancy scare has seen an...unfortunate spike. Especially in suicidal thoughts. What if my partner leaves me and I'm left with a baby by myself? I have an IUD--is this pregnancy ectopic? How would I feel if I miscarried? Can I handle being a mother?

The suicidal thoughts have passed for now, but I fear that a positive test might bring them back. Everybody talks about postpartum depression, but what about depression during the pregnancy? How do you handle it, especially if it's caused by the pregnancy itself?

Edit: blood test was negative! Thank you for the advice, stories, and comfort you all provided me.

NICUParents,"3 weeks in the NICU, born at 28+3. Worried about growth trajectory","My son was born through spontaneous preterm labor 3 weeks ago on 8/26 at 28+3.

i got pissed off and felt defeated. i’m tired of fucking dealing with this. i don’t know why my body just won’t fucking work.

when i realized it was false labor again, i told everyone to stay home & not come by. what the fuck is the point of them coming by? especially when i’m pissed off & MAJORLY upset (this pretty much cements that i’m going to be needing to be induced- that’s a post for a different day though).

i come from a really tight family. my mom is my best friend and my sisters + brothers are the only people i consistently talk to everyday (obviously besides my husband lol).

i told my mom to tell everyone not to come by anymore. it’s not real labor, there is no reason for them to stop by. i’m in pain and the pain isn’t doing shit fuck to get my baby here. i slept for four hours, broken up by having to get out of the bed to pee three different times.

they showed the fuck up anyways. i told them they weren’t respecting my fucking boundaries & there was no reason for them to be here. i’ve been in false labor for 11 hours, i haven’t slept, i’m cranky, i’m devastated- i need to be left ALONE. & you wanna know what these fuckers had the audacity to say?! “sorry we care” —shut the fuck up if y’all actually gave a fuck about me / my well being / my mental health, then you would RESPECT MY GODDAMN BOUNDARIES. i said don’t fucking come over, so when you show up on my fucking doorstep anyways- adamant that i’m in labor, & then basically tell me i don’t know anything about what’s going on in MY body- i’m gonna get pissed the mother fuck off. i told them they can find out when the baby is here through facebook since they don’t want to respect my boundaries & then BLAME me when i’m not down for pleasantries.

& now everyone is looking at me like i’m the psycho bitch because i freaked the mother fuck out. they’re all mad at me now.

fuck everything about today. & fuck my body for going into false labor TWICE, once while overdue. this shit makes me wanna drink a gallon of fucking castor oil.

NICUParents,"28 weeker was close to going home, now back in intensive care for bloody stool and I’m terrified","My 28-weeker is 70 days old and had made great progress towards discharge. On Monday they discovered blood in his stool and since then he’s been moved back to intensive care, taken off feeds and has an IV and incubator again. We don’t know whether it’s a food allergy or NEC (an infection); the last x ray showed inconclusive results and wasn’t an improvement over the last one, so he’s on antibiotics while they continue to evaluate.

I’m so terrified. I already felt re-traumatized walking back into the intensive care pod and seeing my baby back in a box with a million tubes and wires. When I see NEC mentioned in preemie/NICU communities it’s always so scary and serious. The doctors say they really have no way of knowing how any of this will progress or turn out. They say it’s reassuring that he’s large and has had good vitals and bloodwork results, but that isn’t a guarantee that things won’t get worse.

AskDocs,Long term Covid symptoms,"28f 130lbs no medication, occasionally vape thc, use cbd oil for anxiety, drink socially.
medical history- 3 pregnancies, all vaginal deliveries 


In late February/early March my entire family got really sick.
Nasty cough, fever, fatigue. My eldest child needed to go to urgent care because he had hallucinations from low oxygen, he tested negative for the flu. Every time I took a breath it felt like it was restricted. Every time I blew my nose there was a small tinge of blood. I was exhausted just walking room to room. I don't have insurance and tend to ignore medical issues as it is, I wasn't near death so I didn't seek medical help, just waited for it to pass, after a few weeks it did.
Also around this time all the skin peeled off the bottom of our toes. And my hair began falling out in handfuls. 

Now it's 6 months later and within these 6 months life has been stressful as all hell what with lockdowns and lost jobs and everything else going on. So I've been ignoring the things I've been experiencing and attributing them to the stress.

Over these 6 months I have still had bouts of extreme fatigue. My hair has not stopped falling out, every time I comb it handfuls come out. I have blatantly obvious bald spots at these point and I get sharp pains in my chest. I began to find it hard to think and remember things, and stumble over my words a lot when talking.

I have recently read that these are symptoms common in some people who have had Covid and I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do about them.
I recently began taking collagen to hopefully help with the hair loss. But will it even help if its post covid symptoms? 
How long will this last... it's been going on for half a year already?

I should have health insurance in the next month or so, is this even worth bringing up to a doctor.
Last time I took my oldest to urgent care I asked about an antibody test and the doctor agreed it sounded like we had covid, but said an antibody test wouldn't be reliable as it had been over 3 months.

I feel like I sound crazy, but is there anything I can or should do?",15,1,2020-08-17,late delivery,393,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,I hope you find comfort in this. From an ex preemie.,"Hi, I’m a micropreemie survivor from 1998. I want to give parents some kinda image of a potential future, some hint of hope, for their children. I see many posts about survivors of preterm birth, but nothing about adults, so it occurred to me that in this awful year, I could do something good. 

I was born in 1998, at 24 weeks, weighing 1lb 5oz. When I was born, they thought I was dead. I had countless blood transfusions, bilateral grade 3 IVH (brain bleed), grade 3-4 are severe. Many times they tried to take me off of the ventilators so I could breathe, and I’d just end up crashing. My parents often walked in to them performing chest compressions. They told my parents that I’d be severely disabled, mentally retarded, unable to walk, talk, see or hear. They offered to take me off of life support. 

I’m here at 22 now, I have aspergers (which runs in my family) and ADD/anxiety (also genetic), and dyscalculia (maths dyslexia) That’s it. No movement issues at all, not even asthma.

NICUParents,"3 weeks in the NICU, born at 28+3. Worried about growth trajectory","My son was born through spontaneous preterm labor 3 weeks ago on 8/26 at 28+3.  He's very healthy as far as being premature goes, and was at 2 lb 9 oz when and 15 inches when he was born.  He finally started climbing above his birth weight about 10 days in, and is now at 3 lb 1 oz, but is struggling with episodes of apnea.

I am a bit concerned about his growth though - over the last 3 weeks he gets measured on length and head circumference every Sunday, but his head circumference has only gone up 1 cm from 26 to 27 cm, and his length has gone from 37 to 38 cm, which is still at 15 inches.

NICUParents,I can't do it,"I've gone to see my baby girl every day since she was born last week (11 weeks early) and I just... don't know how much longer I can do it. I feel like I'm barely functioning as a person. 

My boyfriend died of cancer shortly before I found out I was pregnant, and he was the only person I had left in the world. I struggled this whole pregnancy and I really thought that her being born at the end of it was going to be the thing that made things better and, well. 

I'm depressed. I feel worse than I did when I went into inpatient when I was pregnant with her. The idea of having to get out of bed (that could be the sentence in and of itself tbh) and go to see her attached to a million tubes and wires is fucking horrible. I can't hold her, and my body is so fucking useless I can't even pump milk for her. 

I can't do this. and expressing that thought makes me feel like I may as well just give her up to parents who will love her properly because it clearly indicates that I suck as a parent.",15,7,2020-11-04,pregnancy depression,202,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Long term Covid symptoms,"28f 130lbs no medication, occasionally vape thc, use cbd oil for anxiety, drink socially.
medical history- 3 pregnancies, all vaginal deliveries 


In late February/early March my entire family got really sick.
Nasty cough, fever, fatigue. My eldest child needed to go to urgent care because he had hallucinations from low oxygen, he tested negative for the flu. Every time I took a breath it felt like it was restricted. Every time I blew my nose there was a small tinge of blood. I was exhausted just walking room to room. I don't have insurance and tend to ignore medical issues as it is, I wasn't near death so I didn't seek medical help, just waited for it to pass, after a few weeks it did.
Also around this time all the skin peeled off the bottom of our toes. And my hair began falling out in handfuls. 

Now it's 6 months later and within these 6 months life has been stressful as all hell what with lockdowns and lost jobs and everything else going on. So I've been ignoring the things I've been experiencing and attributing them to the stress.

Over these 6 months I have still had bouts of extreme fatigue. My hair has not stopped falling out, every time I comb it handfuls come out. I have blatantly obvious bald spots at these point and I get sharp pains in my chest. I began to find it hard to think and remember things, and stumble over my words a lot when talking.

I have recently read that these are symptoms common in some people who have had Covid and I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do about them.
I recently began taking collagen to hopefully help with the hair loss. But will it even help if its post covid symptoms? 
How long will this last... it's been going on for half a year already?

I should have health insurance in the next month or so, is this even worth bringing up to a doctor.
Last time I took my oldest to urgent care I asked about an antibody test and the doctor agreed it sounded like we had covid, but said an antibody test wouldn't be reliable as it had been over 3 months.

I feel like I sound crazy, but is there anything I can or should do?",14,1,2020-08-17,early delivery,393,,,,,,,,,

PregnancyUK,Any other mums going back to work with their partner taking childcare responsibilities?,"Firstly sorry for the formatting, I'm on my phone.

I'm (31) 19+2 and FTM. I've always been very aspirational and career focused since I can remember and I earn significantly more than my husband.

My husband (36) is actually going to be made redundant next year, likely around our due date. We've known since last December so this hasn't come as a surprise. He doesn't enjoy his job at all and isn't career minded. 

We've decided that I'll be taking the minimum maternity I can (it's currently 9 weeks at full pay) using annual leave to top up a little and create a phased return. My husband will be staying at home from birth/redundancy (whichever comes first) with an expectation he won't work for around a year. I'm also incredibly lucky in that I work for a very flexible company and will be working from home the majority of the time next year. 

Financially this protects us as I will have full pay maternity for the time off and then return to work full time. My partners redundancy is generous and will be enough to cover some debts and provide a monthly top-up to my wage for about a year. He will likely start to look for new roles around the 10 month mark and may return to work part time in the first instance. 

My partner is really excited to be a stay at home dad and it seems to be a great option for him. I think he also needs some emotional distance from work so he can figure out what he wants to do next. I'm under no illusion that this will be hard for myself to not fulfil that role but I'm really comfortable and happy with how our little family is shaping up and how we'll work together in a new way to manage. 

I have been feeling quite alone in this as I don't know any couple who've done something similar with the mum returning to work, but I know there's plenty out there. My company have said they've only had 1 other request for shared maternity in 4 years. 

Was just looking to see if there was anyone in this sub in a similar position and what your expectations are/any advice for planning etc?",14,12,2020-12-09,full term birth,381,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Rant/advice/support: Trying to maintain a healthy diet while pregnant during a pandemic,"Before the lockdown, I was doing really well with the diet as in eating decent home cooked meals, smoothies in the mornings, fruit serving throughout the day, occasional indulgences at office birthdays or whatever, pizza on the weekend and very limited unhealthy snacks at home which was the norm. Come social isolation, it has been super hard. During our weekly grocery orders, we order as much fruit as possible but ensuring not to over order so that it doesn't go bad and we don't want to stockpile and empty out grocery shelves. Also, grocery stores are unable to fulfil everything we order so for instance, they ran out of yoghurt last time or roasted almonds.

This has led to me just grabbing whatever is sitting next to me when I get hungry. My husband has been buying more junk food (and I can't stop him either as we are all trying to cope with this situation as best as possible). Normally I have a LOT of self control but now I will grab three oreo cookies when I am hungry just because I don't have healthy snacks handy (there is a health food store seconds away from my house but I rather not to step foot inside any store either). That in and of itself wont be as bad if I wasn't reaching for a Twix bar two hours later and then Ruffles all dressed two hours after that.

I have tried making quinoa salad, or avacado toast but sometimes you just run out and not sure what to do during these crazy hunger pangs. Last week has been espesially rough since my work had a bunch of lay offs and a bunch of coworkers I was close with were let go so my eating has been has been all over the place.

My dinners are still normal, we will have usual stuff like meat, pasta, rice, beans etc. with a green salad and for breakfast I will have a smoothie. It is just the in-between that is driving me crazy and making me feel I am not doing the best for the kid. It sucks because I am not some health nut but I was confident about my diet before this the lock down but now I am not so sure.

Overall it is really confusing if this is because of the pandemic or regular pregnancy behavior? Also an  FTM here.

EDIT: I do work out atleast 30 minutes every day

TLDR; Coronavirus has thrown my eating habits out of the window. Being an FTM, I am not sure if it is the pandemic or pregnancy? My question: is anyone else going through this roller coaster of diet uncertainity? Can anyone advise any other healthy-ish things to have handy? Someone had suggested halo top icecream? Is that a good one to have around.",13,19,2020-05-02,coping during pregnancy,474,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Question about maternity leave/FMLA for parents during extended NICU stays,"Hi all, I hope this is ok for me to post here. I am almost 25wks with B/G, di/di twins. Our girl twin was recently diagnosed with severe IUGR, around 1st percentile currently, and we are currently preparing ourselves for delivery some time in the next 4-7 weeks depending on how the next few weeks go.

My boss wanted me to reach out to HR about making sure my maternity leave/paperwork is taken care of and I started thinking....  I had initially planned to take the 6wks paid from my employer and then do an additional 6 weeks of FMLA to stay with the babies until about 12 weeks. However, now that we are facing an extended NICU stay, I am wondering how to configure this so I don't take a ton of leave while they are still in the NICU. I want to have time off of work when they come *home*, not while they are still in the hospital. 

How did all of you deal with this kind of situation and should I suggest anything to HR? I assume I would have to take my 6wks paid leave and then maybe I can take 6wks of FMLA leave whenever they actually get to come home, but I am new to all of this so I don't know if that's doable!

BabyBumps,Taking antidepressants before delivery,"Hi all,

A few weeks ago I posted about having some prenatal anxiety and depression and got some really wonderful and supportive responses, so thank you all for that! I've brought it up to my midwife and she gave me a prescription for Zoloft and referred me to a perinatal/women's mental health specialist which I'm looking forward to.

My question to you is this-- have any of you started taking an antidepressant during pregnancy/shortly before delivery, and what was your experience like? I'm just a few weeks away from my due date (though I suspect I'll deliver sooner than that-- baby is measuring big and my first was 2 weeks early) so my midwife suggested I start taking the Zoloft now so that by the time I deliver it will be fully in my system and help me pp. What's giving me pause is that my midwife said that whenever a mom is taking an antidepressant during pregnancy that a pediatrician is always invited to the delivery because sometimes baby doesn't ""perform"" the way they should fresh out of the womb. Meaning taking a little longer to start breathing/crying, lower APGAR score, etc. Has anyone had any experience with this?

Thank you!",13,25,2020-08-21,mental health during pregnancy,202,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,My baby will be born at 36 weeks or less. Any advice is helpful!,"So I have ICP and I’m currently 33 weeks pregnant. Also known as Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy. It’s known to cause stillborns and major issues in babies the closer they get to their due date. It’s pretty much a issue with my liver where bile is going into my bloodstream and can hurt my baby boy. I had the same condition with my 1st son but little was known about it and my previous OBGYN never took it seriously and my son almost died in labor because I went overdue. Thankfully he is fine. 

So because of this condition I have to get blood work and NSTs done twice a week and if my bile levels are above a certain amount they will take baby the day they get the bloodwork back or for sure at 36 weeks. I’m nervous since I’ve never had a premie baby before. Is there anything I should be buying? Do I buy special premie clothes or items anyone recommend? Is there anything I should prepare for? With all the restrictions going on will me and my husband be able to see our baby together? Is there anyway he can go home if he is a certain birth weight? He’s already measuring 4.5 pounds.

BabyBumps,Sent preemie diapers as a gift,"So a couple weeks ago we got a pack of preemie diapers in the mail. No note and not from my registry. We were confused but I just figured I signed up for some type of free gift. Turns out, my sister in law set them. I'm 24 weeks and havent had any issues so far. Baby is measuring on target. It made me feel icky that she sent these. Why would I need preemie diapers unless something went wrong? She said that we will need them because the only way to get them in the hospital is from the NICU. Am I wrong to think that the only reason i would need them is if my baby needed to be in the NICU? I know it's not a big deal and she was trying to be helpful, but it rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel like she was counting on my baby coming early and being small.

BabyBumps,How to cope during early pregnancy,"Hello all,

So, I am VERY early on in my pregnancy (somewhere in the neighborhood of 5-6 weeks). In all my prep for baby, I did not anticipate how anxiety fueled I would feel at the very beginning. I always assumed that the stressful part was waiting to find out of you were indeed pregnant. I didn't realize that once you actually are pregnant, it is so up in the air the first few weeks and GOODNESS is it making me worried and panicky. 

I had some bleeding right around the time of my missed period, and I actually thought I had my period. Turns out, it was spotting. It was pretty light but I did spot last Friday afternoon/evening and then a bit again Sunday and Monday morning. Spotting was light and only noticeable when wiping. Then this week, I've had some light cramping. Though I've noticed cramping on both sides, I am noticing it more frequently on the left side. 

I have an early ultrasound set up for next Thursday. My doctor wanted to follow-up since I did have some spotting. 

I am mostly wondering: 1) what spotting/cramping was like for other people, 2) how in the world do people make it through the very beginning when it feels so potentially fleeting and up in the air?!!

Thanks, Mamas.

BabyBumps,Can we talk about depression and anxiety during pregnancy?,"I've had severe anxiety and depression for well over a decade now. I used to have frequent panic attacks, bad enough that sometimes they would trigger seizures, but thankfully those have slacked off a bit. My depression, however.. here lately it seems like I have more bad days than good. Yeah, I'm excited for my baby. But I'm having such a hard time being excited about much else when I constantly feel like absolute shit. 

My anxiety is bad too, but not bad enough for full-blown panic attacks. At least not like, regularly. I had a panic attack in Walmart about a week ago and it hit me so suddenly that my boyfriend had to help me out of the store and into the car. I'm so scared that something is going to happen to this baby, that I'm scared to do anything. I go to work (when I'm actually feeling up to it, I spend most of my time hovering over a toilet bowl so my boss has been really lenient with my schedule) but even when I'm at work I barely do anything except ring people up because sometimes I'm flat out afraid to move. 

I had a miscarriage two years ago and it was so traumatizing.. I'd taken a test that turned out positive and then the next day I started bleeding... The hospital I went to made me sit there for 6 hours before the doc came in, said ""you're having a spontaneous abortion, here's a pamphlet of some FAQs and here's your discharge papers."" No sense of care or compassion, just cold articulation that left me numb until I got home and actually passed my baby... And then my world just fell apart. 

With this pregnancy... I'm terrified that the same thing will happen. I've had two doctors appointments so far, and we got to hear the heartbeat at the second one and that made me feel a little better, but I'm still just fucking terrified of being pregnant. Babies I can handle. I've babysat dozens of kids of all ages, from birth to 12 years old. I know how to take care of babies.. but I don't know how to be pregnant. I don't know how to convince myself that it's okay to be pregnant again. My anxiety keeps telling me that something is going to go horribly wrong again, and my depression takes that thought and runs wild with it. I'm having suicidal ideations. No, I'm not a danger to myself. I would never hurt myself as long as my baby is okay.. but if something were to happen to my baby, I honestly don't know if I would make it through that shit again. I barely survived the first time.. the only thing that saved me was my best friend refusing to leave my side for the first two weeks. He slept in my bedroom floor, made sure I ate, and generally just took care of me while I was too heartbroken to take care of myself. I know I have a support system should anything like that happen again, but.. how the hell do I stop worrying about something that may end up not even happening?",11,12,2020-07-28,pregnancy depression,535,,,,,,,,,

I'm in my mid 20s and very unhappy in my career as a software developer. Although the pay is great, I can't see myself doing it long-term and my mental health is suffering.

However, I'm so unhappy in my job so I would like to make this switch NOW. Thus, to get my toes in the water for teaching, we are considering me quitting my job, taking a few teaching classes in the fall, and start a bit of substitute teaching.

NICUParents,Not coping well and feeling guilty about it,"Just a vent - have no one really to sound off on. I’m one of the first in my friend groups to have a baby, and the ones who did had perfect pregnancies and no complications with their delivery. And my husband is doing so well with handling everything, I wish I could do the same.

But as the title says. Baby was born at 32+2. Pregnancy was going well until 23+5 when I was diagnosed with a short cervix (7-8 mm) after two weeks of cramping. Was hospitalized twice due to concern for preterm labor.

I remember telling my husband that we needed to be prepared to have a preemie. I joined this subreddit around then. Told myself I’d be happy if we made it to 32 weeks. But after those two hospitalizations things were going fairly well. No more cramping/contractions and I was secretly hoping we’d “make it”.

Diagnosed with IUGR at 28 weeks and hospitalized again at 30 weeks after fainting and him having multiple decelerations on the NST when I went in. Started having twice weekly BPPs and dopplers were a little funky but nothing bad, just weird. And his BPPs were always great and he moved a ton.

Anyway long story short had an emergency CS at 32+2 that was quite traumatic. And he’s been doing quite well since then. He was intubated briefly then on CPAP for 2 days. Now we’re at day 10 in the NICU and I’m so over it. I’m tired of leaving my son in the hospital. I hate seeing the NG in him. The leads. Part of me doesn’t want to go see him anymore because it hurts so much just seeing him there and of course leaving is the worse. But when I’m not at the hospital by his side I feel so anxious and can’t focus on anything else really. 

But I feel so guilty. Because he’s doing great and I know all things considered he could be worse off. Like this is only day 10. What about the micropreemies who are on ventilators for a long time? Or the term babies who need surgeries. He literally just needs to learn how to eat. So I feel super guilty that we “have it good” so to speak and I can’t be grateful that he’s doing well. 

And my husband is so level headed about it, but sometimes I feel like he’s minimizing my experience/feelings by saying “oh he’s doing well” or “oh he’s being cared for by experts”.

And to make it worse my maternity leave started and I don’t even have a baby at home. And by the time he is home it will be at least half over. But again feel guilty because some people don’t even get a maternity leave. 

I guess this is just a dilemma of allowing myself to feel sad even though “it could be worse”. I know it gets better but I’m feeling so impatient.",10,10,2020-08-03,preterm labor,495,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Do you feel normal at all during pregnancy?,"Hey all! FTM here. Currently 6+5 and in the full sweep of symptoms. The nausea, exhaustion, irritability, some vomiting. I know they say the first trimester is usually the hardest and it takes a lot of adjusting which I completely understand. My question is, am I going to feel “normal” at all through the next 9 months? Do we just wake up one day and feel good? Or is there just a new normal and you have to wait until you’re not pregnant anymore to go back to feeling like yourself?

AskDocs,30 weeks pregnant and throwing up at night only,"Female, white, normal BMI, no medications, only conditions are pregnant (third trimester) and mild gestational diabetes, age 30, duration 2 days 

Last night and the night before, I threw up after some reflux/burping type symptoms. During the day after throwing up, I’m not too interested in food but I’m able to keep food and water down fine and I don’t feel sick, just a little worn down from previous throwing up. I did NOT have morning sickness earlier in my pregnancy this is new. I assumed it was maybe acid reflux so last night I took a Pepcid, however today I now have extremely liquidy diarrhea. 

I’m extremely confused because if this was stomach bug or food poisoning, wouldn’t I be throwing up more often, not just at night? I don’t have a fever and my blood pressure is normal. I am very scared and have no idea what is going on but my OB won’t let me go in because of covid concerns, even though she doesn’t think I have it.

BabyBumps,Mental Health and Pregnancy,"Maaaan this has been a rough ride, folks.

I have been dealing with body dysmorphia since my teens, I can pinpoint the start of it all but ultimately the problem lies with me and my self-hatred.

Tack on some good ol’ anxiety and a little dose of depression and we have a lovely cocktail of YIKES.

Adverse to even advil or tylenol for headaches and pains, I had been dealing with the hateful, racing, and dark thoughts with medicinal marijuana and what a WONDER it was! I could focus on my at-home work in the evenings without intrusion, my normal triggers were a blip on the radar - easily passed over and forgotten. 

However, now being pregnant marijuana is not an option. It was extremely easy to “just stop”, but it has gotten increasingly hard to just “deal with” my intrusive, hateful thoughts. Especially now that my weight has increased and the bloat has killed my figure. I fart all the time, I feel gross, I look gross. Combine this with being out of work with little-to-no financial assistance available (being self employed) for almost 6 months so far this year...It has been A TIME.

Yes I talk to a therapist, but I wonder if any other people out there are dealing with some serious mental health struggles during their pregnancy as well?

What are you working on? Meditation, mindfulness, avoiding triggers, and watching “happy” media have only been getting me so far. I still hate myself hahahaha!!",10,17,2020-12-22,mental health during pregnancy,248,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Stories of preterm labor?,"Yesterday morning, I woke up out of my sleep just feeling bleh. Which is odd for me because the only thing that can wake me up is my husband leaving for work or the urge to pee. I could sleep through a natural disaster, otherwise. Over the next hour, I started to feel more ill and then started to get cramps. Cramps turned to tightening in my stomach. Tightening turned to painful contractions (every few minutes) with accompanying back pain. I had this for hours until it wore down. Called L&D hours later as I still had tightening, but they did not recommend coming in as it had slowed. 

My stomach from lowest point up to a bit above my belly button was hard as a rock. I had one more episode of contractions during the night, but it was not as painful. I had a bit of mucus come out with the TINIEST bit of blood in it. Lots of pressure when walking.  I had sharp pains and cramps this morning. Now I am 2 hours in to steady contractions again. I think hubs is going to force me to go in at this point even if they don't recommend coming in when I call. Has anybody had an experience even remotely similar and what was the outcome?

AskDocs,35F Painful ovarian cysts and constant increasing watery discharge,"Hi, 
I’ve posted before with related questions having to do with symptoms over the last year or so involving intermittent and sometimes severe pain, pressure, and fatigue. 

My post history has pretty exhaustive information in it about all that, but I’m currently experiencing a huge increase in one of the symptoms and need to ask advice. 

About a month ago I was diagnosed with a large-ish left ovarian cyst and moderate fluid retention in my abdomen through intravaginal ultrasound and told it is most likely a simple cyst and prescribed watchful waiting. I have an ultrasound and appointment scheduled for October 14th. 

One of the symptoms has been an increase in watery discharge, and while I’ve felt it’s been increasing, overnight it has gotten much worse. It feels similarly to when I was pregnant and my water broke. I woke up thinking I’d been bleeding, but instead it’s a constant leak of clear watery discharge with minimal odor. 


I’m just wondering if I need to speak to my doctor about this or wait for the appointment. 

I have a nexplanon birth control implant that is due out in April, not pregnant, and I’m average to underweight except for some gain in my abdomen in the last year. 
Had one full term birth and vaginal delivery three years ago and recent clean Pap smears but a history of severe cervical dysplasia and pain with sex. I also had a bartholin cyst marsupialization two weeks ago that has seemed to be healing well.

BabyBumps,"Advice on anxiety, depression and pregnancy?","Hey there babybumpers! I'm here looking for some advice....

My best friend (36f) is about half way through her pregnancy. For years she has struggled with debilitating chronic depression and anxiety. She was on SSRIs for the last few years, which helped her a lot, but now she's pregnant for the first time and weaned herself off the meds. However, it has meant that her depression and anxiety has come back full swing, along with a kind of aggression that she didn't have before. She said her heart rate is going wild, she is struggling with breathing and she can't sleep due to the anxiety. She is also under a lot of work pressure, and working late hours and weekends.  I'm really struggling to support her, as no matter my approach, she is taking things in the worst possible light and pushing people away, including me, her husband and her family. She told me the other week that although she had no intention of harming herself, she didn't want to live any more. However, from what I see, she is self-harming in a way by overworking, not eating healthily, and spending all her free time watching tv and not engaging with people.

I'm really, really concerned about her, but I don't know what to do or how to help her. I'm worried about what will happen if she gets post-partum depression – will that be the same as her ongoing depression or will it be compounded? The ways the I have always supported her in the past just seem to aggravate her now, which I guess is related to the pregnancy hormones, but I'm not sure.

If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it. Even if it's that I should just leave her to her devices until she's ready to be in touch again...

Thank you!",10,10,2020-09-28,pregnancy depression,308,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,New and needing support.,"Hopefully it's okay to post, because I'm not technically a NICU parent yet.

I ended up in L&D triage last week at 31w2d with a small gush of fluid mixed with blood. It happened again during their inspection of my cervix and they admitted me for the night. Couldn't get confirmation if it was amniotic fluid because the blood was in the way. Moved up to L&D and had more bloody fluid, the Dr estimated about 55 to 100 ccs. Had my first steriod shot that night, started IV fluids and antibiotics. They kept me in L&D for a day, monitoring and measuring baby (fluid levels looked normal compared to previous growth scans, BabyGirl was estimated at 3lb14oz) and then the next day moved me to antepartum until delivery. The suspected diagnosis is PPROM with partial placental abruption.

So here we are at 32w2d. Our goal is to get BabyGirl to 35weeks. I think mentally I've been doing okay but it's an up and down game and I'm hoping someone else here has been there. Some days are great, she does well on monitoring and we just sit. One day she was tachy and we spent 16 hours on the monitor. Some times I use the bathroom and it's clean and clear and then every once in a while there is a small blood clot, or the discharge is darker pink and brown.  Today during both of her monitoring sessions she had a couple of decelerations- that's never happened before and it freaked me out but the Drs who looked it over kept us on a little longer and then we were okayed to go off.

I guess, long story short, is it would be so helpful to know I'm not alone in my experiences with this. To know this can end well. BabyGirl is my 4th bio baby, I had no issues with my first, my second I had a suspected partial abruption at 41 weeks, and my third baby was stillborn at 31 weeks most likely due to placental insufficiency and high blood pressure.

NICUParents,New NICU mom,"After a healthy pregnancy and giving birth on my due date, I am now a NICU mom. A somewhat traumatic birth, that ended up with my baby girl having birth asphyxiation and a many complications to come with it. She had to be resuscitated when she arrived in the NICU. They told us she most likely wouldn’t make it. 

It has now been a week and she is still fighting. She has a brain enema, but the swelling has gone down. She completed hypothermia treatment. She also had a bleed in her liver that has now stopped, but does have a pulmonary bleed that they are treating with different medicines. She originally could not void, but is now pooping and urinating on her own, though she is not urinating as much as she should. She is on a ventilator and sedated. They said her brain and heart function is really good though.

This past week has been really rough. I only have my husband for any support in person as we live in a different country than our families and friends. There is a communication barrier between us and doctors and nurses since the translator isn’t always available. We also can only see her for 5 minutes every once in awhile due to COVID. 

I am struggling because I don’t know many people with kids who have been in the NICU. The few who have been has been due to their children being premature. She is also still considered in critical condition so I am unsure how to feel.

NICUParents,Early steroid shots for lungs?,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for advice or experience if anyone has it regarding betamethasone shots for lungs development. 

I'm at risk for early labor with a history of loss at 22 weeks from cervical insufficiency. I'm 24 weeks in this pregnancy, and being closely monitored by a MFM. They gave me my first shot yesterday at my appointment, and I go back today for the second. 

So far labor doesn't look close, and I was a bit blindsided yesterday since I thought they were going to hold out on the shots unless something looked like it was dramatically changing. My cervix had shortened a bit from the prior week, but was still over 3.5 cm. I couldn't sleep and went down the rabbit hole of drug side effects and now I'm worried that if I do make it 2 more weeks gestation out of micro premie range it won't be enough, or it could have side effects. 

Has anyone had any experience with getting the shot and not going into labor within 7 days? Or needing a second round? It's really hard to find any information besides journals that recommend it at 30+ weeks, but we don't always get to pick those conditions do we. 

Thanks for reading, sorry it's a novel.


Edit: Thank you everyone for taking the time and being so kind to answer all of my worries. I ended up with both shots 24 hrs apart, and he passed his NST after some cold juice. Cervix is still holding up, and no contractions in sight.  🤞It keeps going this way and he stays put until I get firmly in the 3rd trimester.

BabyBumps,Does depression affect a baby during pregnancy?,"TLDR: Feeling depressed. I know I can be a great mom, but am worried my depression will pass to/affect my child. And if so, in what ways? I am 5 months pregnant. 


—-
I (29) was depressed a majority of my life, for reasons (mostly bad skin, but also sexual abuse) beyond my control. As a result, I grew up really quiet/shy, and still deal with anxiety in all social situations. I self-studied psychology, happiness, & health...and only by luck overcame my issues - it took years. I was around 24 when I finally “healed” from feeling suicidal (since 9 years old). It also helped that my skin cleared up in my early twenties and people were more receptive to me. 

I feel all that work to be a more confident, positive person is disappearing quickly. 

First, it was due to my ex cheating (he clearly is obsessed with the looks of this woman)/abusing me around the time he got me pregnant. I left and know he isn’t the one for me, but it still hurts. I didn’t press charges and don’t know if I still could/should. 

Then yesterday I found old letters I wrote about being bullied. I don’t even recall being bullied (did I block it out of my memory?). I just remember being socially isolated from peers and knowing why that was being the only one in school with severe skin issues. I was very young, around 9. 

I am scared my child will fall into the depression that plagued my life. One point in my life I didn’t even want children only because I never wanted them to feel what I felt. What if their skin takes after mine?

I keep crying since finding those letters. I just don’t know how to organically gain the confidence to move forward. 

If things did not fall out with my ex, I feel I would have been my happy self that I worked so hard to become, and even happier that I was expecting a much wanted child with someone I loved and “loved” me. I would have been normal.",9,8,2020-08-30,pregnancy depression,351,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,First baby was overdue and induced; do some people just naturally gestate for 43 weeks?,"Hey everyone. I’m at 38+6 today. No signs of labor yet. Feeling uncomfortable but I could handle another couple of weeks. 

My main worry here is that I have planned (and paid) for a home birth and will have to go to hospital for an induction if I hit 42 weeks. My midwife can’t deliver my baby at home and there’s only one person allowed in the delivery room so she won’t be able to be there at all, even as a doula. 

My daughter was born at 41+5. She was induced, and I wasn’t at all dilated or effaced when I went to the hospital. From what I’ve been able to gather, it looks like second babies usually come a little earlier than first babies, but usually not by much and definitely not always. 

I’m worried because I don’t know how long I would have gone with my first if I hadn’t been induced. I feel like I might just have one of those bodies that stays pregnant naturally for 43-44 weeks.

AskDocs,Are medications intended to be administered via intramuscular injection ineffective if not injected deep enough?,"23F, 169cm, 105lbs, biracial

I've been taking a prescription as an intramuscular injection for a few years and I didn't have any trouble at first, but I lost a lot of weight in that time which has made injections difficult. Generally I use a 1"" needle, though I can no longer get the full needle in without causing significant pain. Recently when I bought needles I bought some that are 1.5"" long. It's hard to tell, but I try to get the needle at least one third of the way in. Since losing weight I have often had issues with some of the medicine I inject coming out of the injection site before I get a bandage on and I have had bleeding from the injection site nearly every time.

I decided tonight to look into whether I might not be doing my injections deep enough, but I couldn't find much information other than that an average person needs a 1"" needle and that women have thicker skin than men in most areas of the body. While I was looking up information I saw something that said tingling, draining, and warmth at the injection site are all reasons for a person to call a doctor immediately, but those are common side effects for me. I'm a bit confused about that. 

I'm planning to switch to a different method of delivery for this medication next time I need a refill since I've been having issues with anxiety surrounding injections lately, but I want to know if I'm doing it right because I will likely return to doing injections in the future when my mental health improves.

What I'm most worried about is how deep I'm actually supposed to insert the needle since I'm significantly underweight and whether my medication has likely been less effective if I have not been injecting it deep enough. I did read that muscle tissue can hold more fluid than subcutaneous tissue which I believe should help clear this up. I take 1ml of this medication weekly. The medication is suspended in either safflower oil or sesame oil (sometimes the pharmacy switches, I'm sure that doesn't matter) with benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate. Each milliliter contain 10mg of the medication. Since I have been having anxiety issues I've been paying more attention to how much of the medication I have injected while I'm doing the injection. I've noticed that pain from the injection generally starts when I reach around 0.5ml injected. I never really thought of it before, but I imagine the pain might be a result of overfilling the tissue I'm injecting into. I did read that arm muscles, due to being smaller, can generally hold up to 1ml of medicine, so I assume that if I were injecting into my thigh muscle, as I'm supposed to, and not the subcutaneous tissue that I would be able to inject a full dose without significant discomfort like I used to. I don't know that for certain though. I do fit into size 00 pants, so I probably can't base my expectations on what an average person could expect.

If anybody has any insight which might help me do my remaining injections better I would really appreciate it.",9,5,2020-11-02,late delivery,540,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,Child’s behavior,"My daughter is just barely 6. 

We met her 2 weeks before her 3rd birthday. She had been in foster care since she was 8 months old after an alleged sexual assault by her bio father. Bio mom has schizophrenia and bipolar she’s also a drug addict and admitted to using during pregnancy. 

She only lived in one other foster home than ours. 

We adopted her when she was almost 4. 

My husband lost his high paying job and had to take a few different jobs that pay a lot less. He’s in school and working full time for a national coffee chain. 

We also adopted our foster son who we have had since birth and his mother asked us to adopt another of her kids a son that we also took home from the hospital. The week he came home we found out we were pregnant (after four years of trying) and it was twins. I developed HG and became unable to care for myself or the kids so my parents would come everyday to help us. During all of this we found out one of the twins had Trisomy 18 and he died. I carried his body and his twin sister until she was born at 35 weeks. Due to all this drama we sold our hone and moved in with my parents. 

So I’m summary we have four living kids. She’s been through hell. 

She’s always had some difficult issues and we even had her tested for seizures. It was negative. 

The issues we have are: 
Impulse control 
Tics
Urinating on herself and even doing it to get back at me or her daddy when she’s in trouble. 
Listening issues which we are having surgery to help with on Thursday. 
Food hoarding, stealing and binging. 
She doesn’t sleep. She’s up and down all night long. 
Inappropriate emotional responses. 
She looses control and has a full meltdown over VERY minor things. For example she was getting a haircut and the stylist brushed her neck with the comb. She became inconsolable because she thought the stylist had sliced her neck. 
Struggles with learning.
Is emotionally more immature than her peers.
Chews everything. 
Breaks everything. 
No volume control. 
Doesn’t listen to directions and argues back with everything. 
Plays dangerously with siblings to the point she can’t be alone with them. 
Lies. 
Never accepts blame. 
Uncontrollable temper tantrums. 

But she’s also very sweet and has an amazing heart. 

Her pediatrician put her on focalin 5mg. I asked for an OT evaluation and she said not yet. 

I guess my question is, does this sound like more than ADHD? 
If so what could it be? 

Sorry for the novel and thank you to anyone who reads this. 

Also, my youngest son age 1.5 has dysphasia and SPD so we have everyone on a sensory diet. We have sensory toys, limited toys, schedule and plenary of outside exercise and this is all still happening.",8,16,2020-06-09,pregnancy trauma,491,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,New NICU mom and very sad.,"How do you cope? Anytime I think of him and being away from him (I was just discharged) All I can do is cry. 

I had Killian at exactly 38 weeks, May 12th. It was a planned c-section, and at delivery we learned his lungs were underdeveloped due to my GD. He is on CPAP, for fast breathing. He is breathing room air now, but he’s still having the occasional episode so they don’t want to take him off of the CPAP. I’m very grateful for them obviously but I am so damn sad. I barely got to hold him, and when I did it was right out of my c-section and I was really really sick from the anesthesia. He’s also receiving phototherapy right now, his jaundice levels are only 10.6 which aren’t horrible, but I was told they peak on the 3rd day, which would be tomorrow so they’re being proactive and I love that. 

I just really miss him. I have a three year old, so the only time I can go to the NICU is when we have a sitter. We have an amazing support system and help, but they have jobs too. 

How do you stop from crying all the time? How can you relax and try to heal when all you can do is think about going and sitting with them?",8,6,2020-05-14,c-section delivery,227,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Not coping well and feeling guilty about it,"Just a vent - have no one really to sound off on. I’m one of the first in my friend groups to have a baby, and the ones who did had perfect pregnancies and no complications with their delivery. And my husband is doing so well with handling everything, I wish I could do the same.

But as the title says. Baby was born at 32+2. Pregnancy was going well until 23+5 when I was diagnosed with a short cervix (7-8 mm) after two weeks of cramping. Was hospitalized twice due to concern for preterm labor.

I remember telling my husband that we needed to be prepared to have a preemie. I joined this subreddit around then. Told myself I’d be happy if we made it to 32 weeks. But after those two hospitalizations things were going fairly well. No more cramping/contractions and I was secretly hoping we’d “make it”.

Diagnosed with IUGR at 28 weeks and hospitalized again at 30 weeks after fainting and him having multiple decelerations on the NST when I went in. Started having twice weekly BPPs and dopplers were a little funky but nothing bad, just weird. And his BPPs were always great and he moved a ton.

Anyway long story short had an emergency CS at 32+2 that was quite traumatic. And he’s been doing quite well since then. He was intubated briefly then on CPAP for 2 days. Now we’re at day 10 in the NICU and I’m so over it. I’m tired of leaving my son in the hospital. I hate seeing the NG in him. The leads. Part of me doesn’t want to go see him anymore because it hurts so much just seeing him there and of course leaving is the worse. But when I’m not at the hospital by his side I feel so anxious and can’t focus on anything else really. 

But I feel so guilty. Because he’s doing great and I know all things considered he could be worse off. Like this is only day 10. What about the micropreemies who are on ventilators for a long time? Or the term babies who need surgeries. He literally just needs to learn how to eat. So I feel super guilty that we “have it good” so to speak and I can’t be grateful that he’s doing well. 

And my husband is so level headed about it, but sometimes I feel like he’s minimizing my experience/feelings by saying “oh he’s doing well” or “oh he’s being cared for by experts”.

And to make it worse my maternity leave started and I don’t even have a baby at home. And by the time he is home it will be at least half over. But again feel guilty because some people don’t even get a maternity leave. 

I guess this is just a dilemma of allowing myself to feel sad even though “it could be worse”. I know it gets better but I’m feeling so impatient.",8,10,2020-08-03,preterm birth,495,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Having trouble focusing/prepping due to stress/PPD,"So we're 3.5 weeks into our NICU stay, little dude came at 28 weeks so we've still got a decent stay ahead of us. The delivery was an emergency c-section that was a huge, huge surprise-- my pregnancy was perfectly healthy and really quite low-key until, in the blink of an eye, it wasn't. A lot of the delivery is still a confusing mystery to me. 

So I basically missed out on my third trimester, the time that I'd intended to spend setting up the house and reading, doing my best to prep for a newborn. And now my attention span and sense of purpose are just shot. I can't focus long enough to read any baby books. I can't seem to get around to doing any prep around the house without being overwhelmed by sadness and a sense that ""this isn't how it was supposed to be"". Our NICU only allows 1 visitor every 24 hours so my husband and I alternate days to visit. This means that every other day I have the house to myself and no obligations, and could totally be really productive...if I could get myself out of bed and stop crying for a few minutes. 

My son's prognosis is generally good, he has various struggles every day but his care team hasn't shown any doubts that he'll eventually be coming home with us, happy and healthy. So I still need to do all that third trimester prep, I'm just....I'm really struggling with it. I've started on a psychiatric drug for my depression and am working with a therapist; some days are better than others. Most days, my biggest triumph is managing to pump for close to the recommended amount of time. 

How do you move past the sadness, and regret, and regain that sense of pregnant excitement/anticipation for baby prep?

NICUParents,"At what age can I expect my baby to become more alert, awake, and responsive to his surroundings? Is this typical?","My baby was born at 28+4 weeks via emergency c-section due to severe early onset intrauterine growth restriction after heart decelerations were detected on the fetal monitor. He came out weighing 1lb 0.2oz and was 10 inches long. It was a placental issue, all chromosomal issues were ruled out. So far he’s had a few issues with his blood work, some jaundice, and had to be intubated for the first few days on low vent settings and low oxygen requirements. He has a PDA and some brady events where he desats but he recovers quickly with stimulation. Blood gases look good, no brain bleeds, no infections, and is gaining weight despite not quite tolerating full feeds yet and only his trophic feedings so far. 

My question is at what age did your baby finally become more alert and aware of your presence? My little guy is 3 weeks old today (almost 32 weeks CGA) and it seems like he just sleeps all the time. Even when he wakes up he opens his eyes and looks at me but doesn’t seem to acknowledge I’m there and it’s hard to even tell if he’s awake or just opening his eyes in his sleep. 

My other son was born at 37 weeks and came out very alert and wide awake, so only a 5 week age difference. 

Is this normal for micro preemie babies or could this be a sign that he has some degree of cognitive issues? When can I expect him to be more aware and acknowledge my presence? At what corrected gestational age did your baby cry regularly and want to be held?",8,11,2020-12-30,gestational age,273,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,IUGR - experiences and 2nd pregnancies?,"My guy was born at 34+1 due to IUGR and gestational hypertension and spent 3 and a half weeks in the NICU.  In the NICU he mainly worked on eating and growing out of Bradys.  His stay was pretty straightforward with no major complications. 

I was hoping that others would share their experiences with IUGR. 

I was diagnosed IUGR at 26 weeks and then at 34 weeks was diagnosed with gestational hypertension at my weekly BPP/NST. From there I was sent to triage and then delivery where I delivered via c-section due to baby’s heart rate dropping during contractions.  

Since then my BP is under control and little guy is doing awesome.  He is gaining weight and crushing milestones.  We are very happy.  

When I was diagnosed with IUGR at 26 weeks it seemed like there was very little information about it other than in the few (very scary) research articles.  

There was also a very strange week where the doctors weren’t sure if he had dwarfism or IUGR.  

If you had an IUGR baby would you be able to give some feedback about your outcome?  I am especially interested in how a 2nd pregnancy turned out.  From what I’ve read it seems very likely for this all to happen again.",8,12,2020-10-24,c-section delivery,211,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,SSRI withdrawal when not withdrawing - the other brain zaps,"37F, anxiety and panic disorder,  5'5, overweight, meds side effects

Sertraline - 150mg x 2/day
Wellbutrin - 300mg/day
Pariet (reflux medication) - 20mg/day

I don't smoke, do drugs and drink a few times a year in very limited quantities (I worry about the drug interactions with alcohol)

Weirdly, I logged on to ask about these withdrawal symptoms and saw another post called brain zaps describing something different. I didn't want to commandeer their post, so wanted to start a new one. 

I'm having withdrawal symptoms from Sertraline but I've been on it for ~3 years and haven't changed my dose recently. I've been on Wellbutrin for 1.5-2 years, can't remember exactly. 

I'm having terrible headaches and brain zaps every day, worst in the evening, and it's really starting to bother me. I haven't changed my dose recently and take it regularly (I understand the symptoms if I miss a dose but this is happening when I'm on schedule). 
I also have bad night sweats and sexual side effects but those I can cope with if it means no panic attacks. 

This was happening a while back (maybe 6 months ago and had been ongoing for about 6 months before that) and my doctor increased my dose and then later had me split it so I take 150mg in the am and 150mg at night. The thought was that I was going into withdrawal between doses. For about 6 weeks, it was much better but they've been back for nearly a month now. 
I also take Wellbutrin. It was supposed to help combat some of the Sertraline side effects. I'm not sure if it did or not. 

I was on Effexor years ago and coming off was AWFUL. I was in a really solid place mental health wise and it started a downward crash that would take years to get past. 
After cycling through about seven different medications with a real ""guesser"" of a psychiatrist, I got pregnant and just stuck with one that was ineffective but apparently safe for pregnancy. After baby was born, I was referred to a psychiatrist for pregnant and postpartum moms. My anxiety was a MESS. She put me on the Sertraline and it really helped. That was 3 years ago.

I wouldn't say my anxiety is fully under control but it's a million times better than it was. I'm really scared to go off of it and spiral down again but these side effects are making me miserable. 


Has anyone had any success in making the brain zaps and headaches go away while still on the medication? 
Could it be the Wellbutrin as well? 
A friend suggested trying CBD oil but that feels like playing with fire in case it just makes it worse. 

I mentioned it to my GP and he had never heard of brain zaps and they're so hard to describe. 

I don't know what to do. Any advice would be amazing.",7,6,2020-05-13,mental health during pregnancy,490,,,,,,,,,

I had a bilateral tubal ligation five years ago following my second c-section and am getting the Mirena IUD on Wednesday to (hopefully) ameliorate lifelong heavy periods that have me in adult diapers four days out of the month.  When I talked to my OB-GYN on October 1st, she told me to get a pregnancy test from the hospital lab the day before the procedure (as well as to abstain from sex for two weeks before, two weeks after).  I asked if it was necessary, since I'd had the tubal, and she said it was.  Fine.

Last week, I called the doctor's office to ask about the cytotec that I was supposed to insert the night before.  I spoke to the nurse practitioner, and asked about the lab form for the pregnancy test.  She said it was unnecessary, since I'd had the tubal.  I asked again, saying that Doctor XXXXX had told me to get the test, and she got annoyed and said that it wasn't necessary.  I was irritated about being told two different things by different people and took detailed notes of the conversation (a similar failure to communicate happened before, when I got a blood pregnancy test for an endometrial biopsy, and was told later it was unnecessary).

My nightmare is that I will get there on Wednesday and not be allowed to get the IUD.  I am desperate to get this done and I've had to schedule it two months in advance.  My husband took the day off from work so he could watch the kids while I go.  I need to get this done.

I want to call again, tomorrow, but I'm afraid of speaking to the same nurse and being ""that patient.""

AskDocs,"A general question, or “to call the nurses line or not call the nurses line?”","Is it annoying when patients call you with questions? If you have one of those late-night exchanges, do you ever roll your eyes at patients who call only to have nothing actually wrong with them?

My basis for this question: I’ve had two high risk pregnancies, called my OB late at night with the first baby because I couldn’t breathe/thought I was dying only for it to be heartburn. Looking back on my second pregnancy, there were probably a few times I should have called the exchange/nurses line, and maybe my preeclampsia would have been diagnosed earlier. But I was too nervous about looking like an idiot if it ended up being nothing, and basically convinced myself everything was normal when it wasn’t. 

Flip side, now I have two children and between the two year old who can’t stop hurting himself/cut his finger and it got infected/had a wild allergic reaction to bug bites, and the borderline-preemie newborn with colic and a weird belly button, it seems like I’ve been into the office at least once a week for things I feel I should have been able to handle on my own. Basically have the nurses number on speed dial because the kids are too young to actually tell me what’s wrong with them and I worry about it.

NICUParents,Reflux tips,"Hello, my little girl was born at 32 and is now 36 gestational age. From talking to the nurses and reading posts on this sub I think she struggles with reflux. She’s spit up a few times, but mainly she gets hiccups, grunts, distended belly, arches her back, and has oxygen saturation dips. She gets fortified breast milk and will be on Neosure when discharged. But I’ve read posts on this sub that lead me to believe those can aggravate a babies stomach. The doctors haven’t told me to try any dietary changes for my breast milk (like cut out diary). The doctors and nurses aren’t that concerned with her symptoms, but I hate to see her uncomfortable. Any tips for reducing reflux in the NICU and when she’s home?

I keep her upright for 30 minutes after feedings when I am there. The nurses put her bed up at an angle. They have advised against an angled pillow after discharge because of SIDS risk.",7,5,2020-11-17,gestational age,165,,,,,,,,,

Should I just resign and focus on my mental health?
Is having a baby generally expensive? Most of my friends in England are single because according to them having babies in general is hard... They would rather have pets to be fair.

Please any tips or advice will help. I just want to make sure that all these worries I have are just in my head. 😭 Thank you x",7,21,2020-12-30,PTSD pregnancy,285,,,,,,,,,
PregnancyUK,Sad - TW (neighbors still birth),"A girl on my street gave birth to her 22week baby girl this morning. She (the baby) had loads of health problems and was still born. I am absolutely devastated for her and wish I could do something to help, even though nothing will. I'm scared to go see her as I'm starting to show and I don't want her to be sad or angry because of my pregnancy. 

There's no real meaning to this I'm just so sad for her and scared for me now that I needed to get it out. I was talking to my husband about it but he asked me to stop. It was making him feel anxious and he knows there's no control over what happens. I've never seen him look so scared. Meh hopefully a good cry and I'll feel a bit less emotional.",7,3,2020-09-24,emotional health,141,,,,,,,,,

Ive never been much of an anxious person but for some reason ever since ive found out im pregnant ive had 4 panic attacks. Just major anxiety that gets triggered very easily. It keeps me up at night, it kills my appetite, i cant sit still....

has anyone ever experienced this during their pregnancy?

NICUParents,NICU Bag,"I’m 27 weeks pregnant. I was hospitalized last week for preterm labor. I’m fully effaced at this point and a couple cms dilated. I’ll give birth to our son any hour/day now.

Our hospital does not have rooms for NICU babies or families. Nine isolettes share a large room with a nurses station. Each isolette gets one recliner for family. Due to the COVID virus only one parent can be in the NICU with the baby at a time. My husband and I are going to do our best to trade-off shifts. 

My original diaper bag is obviously a joke now as that’s for a newborn baby. What did you all have in your bags that you kept with you at the NICU? Breast pump supplies, notebook for doctor notes, cellphone chargers, and books to read to the baby seem like a given. What else would you all recommend?",7,11,2020-07-13,preterm birth,149,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Inexplicable fluid in abdomen,"I'm sitting here with my wife turning to the internet to see if there is someone out there who might know something.  Let me start with saying that she has given my permission to post and ask for advice and is sitting next to me as we speak.

Here is the down and dirty.  Female, 35 years old, 5'5"", 116 lbs after last paracentesis, fluid is accumulating in her abdomen and we don't know where it is coming from.  She has had a 5 paracenteses performed with the most recent one being today where they removed 2.2 liters of fluid.  The others have ranged anywhere from 800 milliliters up to 4 liters.  She is currently taking 200 mg progestin with the idea of the cause possibly being endometriosis.  She has been taking it for about 3 months and it doesn't seem to be helping.  Blood has been tested...no cancer markers, nothing wrong with the liver, hormones seem to be fine.  We have been dealing with this for roughly 4-5 years and trying to find an answer with no help from any doctor we have talked to.

A little more background...born premature and had necrotizing enterocolitis a few weeks after birth resulting in a bowl perforation and some portion of the colon removed to fix it.  Everything seemed fine until roughly 2011 where she went in for a laparoscopy to see if she had endometriosis and see if they could see anything that might be causing fluid accumulation (this was around the time they first noticed the fluid in smaller amounts).  Long story short, they botched the laparoscopy...couldn't get in with the camera and injured her bowls which resulted in peritonitis.  2013 they took a sample of the fluid and claimed it was just normal cell fluid.  Fast forward to 2017, we start to see an extended abdomen and large amounts of fluid retention.  First paracentesis is in 2018 and they removed roughly 1 liter.  Next one is a year and half years later and they removed 4 liters. Four months later they removed 900 mililiters and five months later (the one today) was 2.2 liters. (Forgive me if my timeline is off but its pretty close). 

The fluid is a dark brown/reddish color.  It's not thick or turbid.  (think a browner tinted red wine).  Anyway, we have seen OB, GYN, Liver specialists/Hepatologists, General Surgeons, Cardiologists, General Practitioners,  Oncologists (even ovarian cancer specialists)...the list goes on in both Germany and the United States.

We have no idea what is causing this fluid to build up and it is starting to wear down all aspects of our lives.  She is in pain with no energy.  Doctors can't figure it out and with the amount of internal scarring in her abdomen, they aren't comfortable doing any surgery to find out (neither is she or I for that matter).  Ultimately, we are just hoping that someone might have seen or heard of a case like this and would have some information to offer since we can't seem to make any headway with it.

Also, I would like to apologize for the long post and I will be available to answer any other questions you might have.  Feel free to private message me or just drop a comment.  Thank you all for your time",6,14,2020-06-12,premature birth,549,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Boundaries for boundary stomping MIL?,"My husband and I trying and recently had a conversation about if we get pregnant and who would be in the room for the actual birth. I don’t want anyone to even know I’m at the hospital until after we are home and comfortable except for husband and my family. He agreed, but mentioned how badly his parents will take this, especially if my mom gets to be in the room. For their other grandchildren they were in the room through the birth or waiting in the waiting room overnight and then stayed with the new parents to “help” (but really just hold baby instead of clean/cook). I’ve seen how my MIL’s countless boundary stomps go unchecked by my sisters-in-law and worry how things might escalate with the golden child (my husband). They range from small comments when she doesn’t agree with something to invasions of privacy to full blown not listening to the parents rules and doing whatever she wants with zero consequences. Neither sister stands up to her. My husband doesn’t really either unless he absolutely has to- he normally just leaves the room or hangs up the phone. If it is important, he stands his ground, but then feels guilty after. 


While it is a little premature, I’ve started a list of boundaries to talk about with my husband so we are on the same page. I’m worried if we don’t talk early enough, things will progress and I’ll have little backup if things get heated. I’m wondering if anyone could share advice or add things I might now even be thinking of. So far my list is:


-Anyone who wants to be around future baby must be up to date on vaccinations(my in laws are vaccinated, but embrace the ideas behind anti-vax - so I’m concerned about boosters) 


-No sharing photos of personal information on social media (my MIL shares EVERYTHING on FB and will vague post about anything that upsets her, making herself the hero/victim of whatever situation) 


-No one will be at the hospital or staying with us. We can have visitors for short spurts a few (days? Weeks?) after birth. 


-No unmonitored time (aka they will never be alone with any kids of ours) - this was my husband’s request before we even got married and I second it. I have no idea how we communicate that without all of my in-laws blowing up at us and making me out to be the bad guy. They think they are the perfect family and the best grandparents ever, so telling them otherwise would be devastating for them. 


If you set any hard rules like this, how did you communicate boundaries with your in-laws? I know the excitement comes from a place of love and I want to embrace that. I also want to keep future baby safe. Our last attempt at communicating boundaries around the holidays went horribly, with my MIL screaming insults at us and crying that we’ve ruined holidays forever and that her son might as well be dead because he doesn’t love her or his sisters. My husband just shut down during the convo and we did what we wanted (though he felt extremely guilty) and after a month of guilting the fight was rugswept by my in-laws. The process was unproductive to say the least. I definitely need advice on this. Thanks for any help!",6,18,2020-05-27,premature birth,565,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Pregnancy after premature birth (incompetent cervix/PPROM) and progesterone supplementation as a preventative measure. Any moms with experience?,"Four and a half years ago I gave birth to my son at 31 weeks. My water had broken and within an hour I was at the hospital. A cervical check revealed that my cervix was pretty much fully effaced and I was 1cm dilated. I gave birth 13 hours later.

I am now expecting baby #2 and will be meeting with an OB in two days (I'll be close to 16 weeks pregnant), and I was wondering if I should insist on taking progesterone (through either vaginal suppositories or the 17P shots). I previously met with this OB (two years ago) and he only mentioned monitoring my cervix thickness through transvaginal ultrasounds for future pregnancies and using progesterone if there was evidence of thinning. However, I've recently looked up some articles and it seems like progesterone is often recommended as a preventative measure after having a premature delivery to decrease the risk of another preemie (rather than just waiting for evidence of the cervix starting to thin).

I was just wondering what other moms in a similar situation have experienced and what was recommended to them. Also, for those who supplemented, did you take progesterone vaginally or through shots?",6,8,2020-06-16,prematurity,200,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Overly fearing a miscarriage with 0 chill,"Possible triggers: cancer
Recently I have felt completely out of control hormonal. I am almost 9 weeks and suffer from extreme PTSD as a cancer survivor. I also suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. As a result of my medical history I have completely convinced myself there is no way my pregnancy will go smoothly. 

I have experienced occurrences of spotting since 7 weeks. Never longer than an hour at a time and only usually when I wipe after using the restroom. Generally the “blood/sporting” doesn’t even reach my pad. I have no cramping or other symptoms aside from pretty rough nausea and very sore boobs. Essentially no reason to expect anything bad. 

ALSO should add, at 7 week check up (because I panicked about spotting) I saw my baby bean, heard it’s heart and everything size wise is on track. When I say no reason to worry I really mean that. 

But there is just this overly powerful voice in my head demanding I listen to it and worry about losing my baby. I fear letting people down. I fear not wanting to try again if I do lose the baby. I’m mortified today specifically after a rough night of no sleep and lots of work/moving related stress. 

I guess I’m just looking for some words of encouragement. Natural methods for relaxing as: my bath tub is broken, I’m a (clean for 4 weeks now) pothead, with work coming up (special ed teacher all virtual this year), and a move being made complex by a shitty seller who thinks she can breach contract and force a later move in date. The anxiety has me at the end of my rope and I’m ALREADY taking anxiety meds (baby safe). 

Any ideas friends?

NICUParents,Cost of NICU stay and Insurance Coverage,"Hello everyone,

I know that this subreddit is for the support for the parents whose babies are in the NICU. Much strength to you guys who were going through tough times and I hope the situation gets better for everyone experiencing this.

We are having twins (MCDA) and the due date is in October. But I just wanted to prepare if we are anticipating few weeks of stay in the NICU. I am concerned mostly about the cost for the NICU stay and the insurance coverage. In general, how much will be the cost for the NICU stay per day and how much the insurance will be able to cover the cost. I talked to my insurance company (UHC) and they told me that there will be a charge of $500/day for the inpatient stay. And I am pretty sure we will hit our out of pocket max ($7.5k for individual and $15k for family) if we are staying in NICU even for atleast couple of weeks.

What will be the better option in terms of insurance and how can I prepare myself to financially manage if there is a NICU stay for few weeks/months?

AskDocs,34 weeks pregnant and baby weighs 2lbs.,"My sister is 34 weeks pregnant and the baby weighed just under two lbs last week (at 33 +1).  My sis sees her two doctors (OB/GYN and MFM) twice a week.  The baby had stalled in growth for a while (I am not sure how long) around the same time that my sister was discovered to have some blood clotting disorders.  She has been on blood thinners since about week 22.  Her OBGYN told us this week that the baby will not reach 4lbs before birth (sometime in the next 6 weeks)and will stay in the NICU until she does reach 4 lbs and can eat on her own.  Her original due date was Dec. 16.  Modified due date was Dec 27.  We were told this week she will not go past Dec 20.  Sis has opted to have a c-section whenever the doctors or her body decides it is time.

I can only find info on babies born that small at 24-26 weeks.  i can't find anything about a baby being that small at this gestational age. the baby has gained 10oz in the past month.  My sister's nurse told her today that this is a miracle baby.  I don't think they ever said as much but it is starting to be clear that the doctors and nurses did not expect the baby to survive this long.

My sister is single, 22, 5'1"".  she weighed about 100lbs but now weighs 124lbs.  she did smoke, drink and do drugs (weed, cocaine, meth) previously but I don't think she has done much more than weed in the 6 months before she got pregnant.  She has always had problems with eating and nausea and now has been diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and some other blood clotting disorders that we had no idea about.  the baby has checked out normal for chromosomal and genetic abnormalities.  No amniocentesis was done. her amniotic fluid values have been between 6 and 8.  baby did have some heart issues (two stenoses and a psuedo hole) but at the most recent ultrasounds the problems seem to have resolved.

what can we expect after the baby is born?  how likely are serious problems?",6,5,2020-11-06,NICU stay,364,,,,,,,,,

PregnancyUK,Moving hospital in late pregnancy?,"Hiya, looking for some advice from others who have done this previously! 
I'm 25 weeks and currently living in England. Due mid March with my first. 
We'd wanted to move to Wales this year but, due to Covid, my husband was unable to get a job transfer over there.
Now, a few spaces for transfer have just opened up and, whatever happens, we can't afford to turn the opportunity down. This would possibly mean him moving over there mid/late Feb.

If this happens, I might have to move my maternity care from where we are in England, to the nearest hospital in mid Wales - and it would be very late in my pregnancy!

BabyBumps,How are you coping with covid-19 changes and pregnancy?,"So this is probably going to be a long rant, but I’ve been feeling so hopeless lately and I’m sure I’m not the only one. How are you all coping and living your lives in the midst of all of this?

I’m 24 weeks and due in late September. My husband is active duty military and this is our first baby. I’m so excited for this baby, we’ve been trying for years, and I lost my last pregnancy. I’m so thankful to be expecting this little boy and that he is healthy and active so far.

Being pregnant during all of this just really sucks. So I’m going to complain to the internet because I feel like a jerk when I do it to my friends and family. I just heard my baby’s heartbeat for the FIRST TIME  yesterday because all of my appointments since I was 9 weeks have been over the phone. My husband wasn’t allowed to that appointment and won’t be to any in the foreseeable future. He is also beyond paranoid and has a fit if I even go to the grocery store, so I’ve been essentially isolated since early March (my job moved to 100% remote work in March). I’m dying for a prenatal massage or a prenatal yoga class or something to help with my old back injury flaring up. None of the maternity clothes I’ve ordered online fit right. Literally no one has seen me pregnant at all since we announced except online-and virtual hangouts are getting so old. My birthday is in a few weeks and I have no idea how to safely celebrate and I just have this feeling that I’m going to be isolated for a really long time, especially once the baby comes. When I found out I was pregnant I had planned on traveling to my hometown in July for a baby shower which probably won’t happen now. I guess I had a lot of expectations for this pregnancy because we tried so long for it, and it just hasn’t been what I expected at all.

These are all such first world problems and I feel so dumb complaining about them at all when people are dying. I know why all of this is necessary and I’m trying so hard to be careful for my sake, my baby’s sake, and the sake of people around me. But I guess all the hormones have me especially emotional today and I wanted to see how everyone else is coping. It doesn’t help that I live in a very popular tourist destination that has completely reopened so we are flooded with vacationers who don’t mask or social distance at all, and most people we know don’t really do much to prevent infection. Everyone here has pretty much gone back to normal almost 100% and I’m just afraid to do that? But I guess I feel jealous of their lack of fucks to give. 

How isolated have you been? Is it messing with you mentally? Am I just being melodramatic and selfish? I’ve been so positive to everyone I talk to, and tried so hard to be upbeat and excited when I talk to them, but I’m feeling more hopeless every day that this is just the beginning.",6,12,2020-06-07,coping during pregnancy,546,,,,,,,,,

I am pregnant the second time. 7 weeks, so it is still early.
Now I am concerned that I could suffer early delivery again like I did during the first time.

Background:
My first pregnancy in 2016 was with di-di twins. 
I was doing good in the beginning, no servere morning sickness, all values good.
In week 29 my gyn discovered that my cervix had shortend to 14mm (if I recall correctly) and I had early contractions.
I was admitted to the hospital immediately, put on best rest, received meds to stop the labor (tokolyse, if this is an english term at all?). I also received antibiotics as there seems to have been an infection.
Well, from week 30 on my amniotic fluid got lower and lower.There was probably a leakage in one of the sacks. 
Also, my cervix just ""vanished"" over the time. It was down to 4mm.
At 32 wks the twins were delivered via c-section.

The hospital told me I had a cervix insufficiency.


How likely is it that this will happen again this time? Was it just bad luck, or because of twins? 
Should I mentally prepare myself for long bed rest and a NICU stay?


I will obvl discuss this with my doc, but the next appointment is in 3 weeks and I am just nervous and worried.

We got it home built it, and were immediately concerned about the car seat for a preemie. It has almost no support/pillows for head and neck other than a thin white insert that you can in the images.

Did we make a mistake here? The store offered to do an exchange but I'm unsure what would be a good replacement.

We're looking at the following since it has some more support but unsure if it's worth the price increase ($CAD):

AskDocs,Swollen lymph node right groin,"30F, 5'7"", 140lbs, white, intermittent right groin lymph node swollen and painful for the past 7 years, no other medical issues, no medications, no smoking, no drinking, no recreational drug use.

The lymph node had been hurting intermittently for the past few years. More pronounced when I get sick (cold, UTI, etc). I went to see PCP and had work up done - labs drawn included thyroid panel, A1c, complete metabolic panel, complete CBC with hematopath consultation and smear. All labs came back negative for anything, including the smear. A ultrasound of the right groin was ordered and it just so happened that it was swollen when it was done, the result was: 3 swollen lymph nodes in right groin, the biggest 2.1cm. PCP sent me for general surgery consult. I was 7 months pregnant at this time, so surgeon suggested to wait until delivery and then to come back to discuss a possible biopsy. He didnt sound too eager to do it (basically said if you want), and said may have lymphadema if you do decide to do it. This was during the early outbreak of covid when they were not doing elective surgeries. I have not done the biopsy yet.

If it was cancerous, wouldn't it have shown on the CBC smear? If it is not cancerous, what else could it be? Same lymph node, same spot for 7+ years. More importantly, how can it be treated?",5,1,2020-09-24,early delivery,239,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Making the decision while high risk.,"So, my husband and I are discussing whether to ttc. One problem in the decision is that I am pretty high risk. And not just one factor in it but several. I am obese, have pcos and prediabetic insulin resistance, but the biggest issue I gather is from a blood disorder called factor v leiden. My gyn said it causes miscarriages, preterm babies, blood clots, and pre-eclampsia. I'm at especially high risk for pre-eclampsia because I had it with my previous pregnancy. My endo says despite the pcos I am ovulating and should be able to get pregnant, however for me the decision is difficult largely due to pregnancy risks. I'm not really asking for advice, my husband and I will be working on the decision in counseling, just wondering if anyone here knew they were high risk beforehand while considering ttc, and how did that decision making process go for you?",5,18,2020-09-26,preterm birth,152,,,,,,,,,

PregnancyUK,Has anyone got any experience of perinatal mental health teams?,"TW: depression, suicidal ideation and thoughts of not wanting to continue with my pregnancy

May be a bit of a deep topic but an important one none the less. 

I have chronic mental health conditions. Severe depression, anxiety and potential PTSD. A lot of trauma in my past around my relationship with my own mother. 

It took me a very long time to manage my mental health prior to becoming pregnant. Lots of trial and error with meds and finding the right counsellor. 

Right before lockdown I finally saw a NHS psychologist (I feel I should play the lottery because I think it would have been easier to win at at that than actually have input from the NHS mental health service!) And I was diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder prior to lockdown too. Been waiting for some specific psychodynamic counselling since. I'll probably still be waiting for it a loong time too.

I am now pregnant and this baby is very much wanted and loved and planned for but I am struggling again and feeling so vulnerable and having conflicting thoughts.

I made the decision to come off my medication for less risk to the baby, so going through withdrawal for that on top of new symptoms and hormones that I have no patience for (you may think it silly but I will have panic attacks if it takes me 20 minutes longer than normal to sleep so this nausea and bloating is driving me insane). I've not had any counselling since lockdown either as my counsellor stopped seeing people due to risk and doesn't do telephone appointments so there's that too. 

The past two nights I have gotten so low that I had feelings of not wanting to be here. Of thinking I can't do this. Of spiralling and trying to think of any negative there could be. I even googled process of how to get an abortion and told my partner I think I have to do that because I can't cope anymore. When I get like this I have severe panic attacks where I hyperventilate and it takes my partner a long long time to calm me down.

I feel so so ashamed and so worried my baby may sense that I even contemplated those thoughts even though I know that's not possible at this point as I am only 4w3d. I feel shameful to admit this on here. 

I DO want my baby and I love my baby so much already. I just feel a lot of struggle managing at the moment and getting through this pregnancy. I also know that I would be a high risk of postnatal depression considering my history.

I am aware that there is a thing called a perinatal mental health service. But my experience of being fobbed off with the NHS MH service makes me feel unsure of what to expect. 

If people who have had experience of it and don't mind sharing what was it like? What do they actually do to support you?",5,5,2020-10-11,pregnancy trauma,506,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,NICU Bag,"I’m 27 weeks pregnant. I was hospitalized last week for preterm labor. I’m fully effaced at this point and a couple cms dilated. I’ll give birth to our son any hour/day now.

Our hospital does not have rooms for NICU babies or families. Nine isolettes share a large room with a nurses station. Each isolette gets one recliner for family. Due to the COVID virus only one parent can be in the NICU with the baby at a time. My husband and I are going to do our best to trade-off shifts. 

My original diaper bag is obviously a joke now as that’s for a newborn baby. What did you all have in your bags that you kept with you at the NICU? Breast pump supplies, notebook for doctor notes, cellphone chargers, and books to read to the baby seem like a given. What else would you all recommend?",5,11,2020-07-13,preterm labor,149,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Pregnancy after premature birth (incompetent cervix/PPROM) and progesterone supplementation as a preventative measure. Any moms with experience?,"Four and a half years ago I gave birth to my son at 31 weeks. My water had broken and within an hour I was at the hospital. A cervical check revealed that my cervix was pretty much fully effaced and I was 1cm dilated. I gave birth 13 hours later.

I am now expecting baby #2 and will be meeting with an OB in two days (I'll be close to 16 weeks pregnant), and I was wondering if I should insist on taking progesterone (through either vaginal suppositories or the 17P shots). I previously met with this OB (two years ago) and he only mentioned monitoring my cervix thickness through transvaginal ultrasounds for future pregnancies and using progesterone if there was evidence of thinning. However, I've recently looked up some articles and it seems like progesterone is often recommended as a preventative measure after having a premature delivery to decrease the risk of another preemie (rather than just waiting for evidence of the cervix starting to thin).

I was just wondering what other moms in a similar situation have experienced and what was recommended to them. Also, for those who supplemented, did you take progesterone vaginally or through shots?",5,8,2020-06-16,premature birth,200,,,,,,,,,
PregnancyUK,Don't really feel like I am getting care with my midwives,"I am trying to look on the positive side now that I am 36+4 and edging towards the end of pregnancy, but I just feel like I'm not really getting care. I don't feel like the midwives listen to me and they are constantly talking over me when I raise questions or ask for information. 

I found out today that things have been documented in my notes that are untrue. for example, apparently I was told at 16 weeks to take iron tablets. No I wasn't, and I specifically asked as I have a history of low iron. My 16 week phone call appointment was horrific. I told the midwife at my appointment that today, and she was not interested in hearing why.

I don't know if my expectations are out of sync of the pandemic has impacted the type of care being provided. Each appointment seems like a tick box exercise and nothing more. I would have thought now is the time to really take care of one another.

AskDocs,34 weeks pregnant and baby weighs 2lbs.,"My sister is 34 weeks pregnant and the baby weighed just under two lbs last week (at 33 +1).  My sis sees her two doctors (OB/GYN and MFM) twice a week.  The baby had stalled in growth for a while (I am not sure how long) around the same time that my sister was discovered to have some blood clotting disorders.  She has been on blood thinners since about week 22.  Her OBGYN told us this week that the baby will not reach 4lbs before birth (sometime in the next 6 weeks)and will stay in the NICU until she does reach 4 lbs and can eat on her own.  Her original due date was Dec. 16.  Modified due date was Dec 27.  We were told this week she will not go past Dec 20.  Sis has opted to have a c-section whenever the doctors or her body decides it is time.

I can only find info on babies born that small at 24-26 weeks.  i can't find anything about a baby being that small at this gestational age. the baby has gained 10oz in the past month.  My sister's nurse told her today that this is a miracle baby.  I don't think they ever said as much but it is starting to be clear that the doctors and nurses did not expect the baby to survive this long.

My sister is single, 22, 5'1"".  she weighed about 100lbs but now weighs 124lbs.  she did smoke, drink and do drugs (weed, cocaine, meth) previously but I don't think she has done much more than weed in the 6 months before she got pregnant.  She has always had problems with eating and nausea and now has been diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and some other blood clotting disorders that we had no idea about.  the baby has checked out normal for chromosomal and genetic abnormalities.  No amniocentesis was done. her amniotic fluid values have been between 6 and 8.  baby did have some heart issues (two stenoses and a psuedo hole) but at the most recent ultrasounds the problems seem to have resolved.

what can we expect after the baby is born?  how likely are serious problems?",5,5,2020-11-06,gestational age,364,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Difficulty coping,"Hello, I’m new here. My little man was born on the 31st of July, 9 weeks early, due to severe polyhydramnios. He was finally discharged last week. My partner and I had issues with the nursing staff, and their ability to follow our care plan. We were blamed for what they called a communication break down, despite being there literally every day and constantly making our plan known. 

It got to the point where I was ready to have him transferred. And suddenly he’s ready for discharge two days later? Which I found highly suspicious, but we decided to keep him there instead of transferring, as he had been doing well and we figured we were ready to finally be done with the NICU.

Now my son is home and it’s hitting me hard just how unprepared I am. We didn’t spend much time practicing bottle feeding because I wanted to breastfeed. The lactation consultant never once mentioned that he was tongue tied and that all he was doing was essentially just chewing my nipple and nothing productive or nutritive, she said that he was doing good and just needed more practice. He was starved whenever I tried breastfeeding, and guzzling bottles down when feeding was left to the nurses, though none of this was communicated until I asked about doing the 72 hour, breastfeeding only period, the hospital was supposed to offer before a bottle was ever even offered.

He can’t sleep without a video I found of the NICU monitors playing. I can’t stand the video, I feel like I’m still just at his bedside back at the hospital, but he starts crying if I pause it, so it’s been playing 24/7. My partner can ignore the video playing in the background and doesn’t understand why it bothers me so much. 

I try to talk with my partner, but he just dismisses what I say, won’t accept that my pregnancy and care has been traumatic. All I hear is how the most important thing is that my son is home and healthy, and I agree. But why can’t I acknowledge that things were less then ideal and they were traumatic? Why can’t I mourn the loss of a normal pregnancy, a normal delivery, not getting to hold my son right away?",5,8,2020-10-04,early delivery,383,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Pregnant and struggling with my mental health?,"Ive recently found out im pregnant and i am currently 9 weeks. Me any my boyfriend are over the moon and couldn't be happier about this.
I am very happy with my life right now and I have everything ive ever wanted or needed.

However, since becoming pregnant its like my brain is unravelling my entire past. Every deep dark memory ive got, even from around 11 years ago or more.

I had a bad few years when i was a teen, involved in a bad crowd and did very silly things, had some scary experiences and been treated extremely badly numerous times in past relationships. 

Its getting to the point now where most of the days im completely sinking into my own mind and can't talk to anybody and it consumes my whole day and sometimes makes me feel sick, anxious and gives me a whooshing feeling in my stomach. 
Sometimes i just break down crying because it gets too much for my brain to handle. It doesnt help that i work from home and im sat on my own through the day. 

Ive frantically googled my symptoms, to see if anybody at all has experienced the same thing. I found one article where a woman briefly mentioned that ""Pregnancy forces you to face any long-held, deep-seated issues you've been hiding in your life,"" but this is the only relatable thing i have found.
It's really getting to me now because its stopping me from enjoying my pregnancy and focusing on staying sound minded and healthy. Ill stop myself from obsessively going over one memory to the point i get so tired of it that i no longer care, but then a new memory will crop up and alarm me. 

These memories are times i have never thought about until now, things id completely forgotten about until now and have absolutley no relevance to my life anymore because i got myself out of all that a very long time ago and i am now doing really well.

I am just hoping to find anyone who might be able to explain why im feeling this way and how long it may last?",4,3,2020-12-19,mental health during pregnancy,362,,,,,,,,,

For months I said I should pick a backup person and he said no because he’ll be there. And now I’m just panicking in a hospital crying. To top it all off he’s just messaged to say he had to put one of his pet birds down and went into extreme detail. I’m a sobbing mess, I’m scared, and honestly at this point I don’t know what to do. I do wish he was here but I don’t really want to talk to him any more.

Update: 
I’m not sure if anyone will read this but I wanted to say thank you, you’re encouragement helped a lot. I was moved to the labour ward this morning after a panic attack. I didn’t think I could do it and was going to wait but the midwife told me it would decrease my daughters chances, so I womaned up and went in. I was still freaking out and managed to sort a back up person after the long attempt to get a cannula in my arm (it did take multiple tries and I’m not gonna lie there was a lot of blood). After that my waters were broken and I started having contractions. The machine that registered them was not picking them up but I was in so much pain I was screaming. I was offered an epidural and I did want one however they couldn’t pick up her heart beat anymore and had to put a monitor near her head. Just before this with each contraction I started pretty much screaming “I need a shit”. They went to put the monitor on and realised I could start pushing. From then it was about 20 minutes of pushing. The whole process only took an hour. I didn’t get any drugs in the end because the gas and air didn’t agree with me and the others they had prepped too late. I couldn’t have done it without the amazing team of midwives and I’m kind of thankful for not having a person I knew there, it proved to me that I could do anything.

PregnancyUK,Previous cannabis use,"Before I found out I was pregnant, I would smoke cannabis once or twice a week, on the weekend to help with anxiety and my runaway thinking brain. I don't drink, I hate alcohol.

As soon as I found out I was pregnant, I stopped smoking and have not touched anything since (23+2).

We both work full time, I've got a professional job, we are just in the process of buying a new house and I have supportive family all around me.

My first urine test was positive and because of that my midwife told me she would have to refer me to Social Services. I haven't been told whether my other tests since were positive or not, but they wouldn't have been as I haven't touched anything, and I pee every time I have an appointment so someone would've said something by now I'm sure.

Anyway, I just wondered what would happen next? 

Will Social Services call me, or want to see me in person?

If my tests are all negative between now and baby birth, would they continue wanting to speak to me?

It feels a bit ridiculous that they only know because I told her, and I only smoked on a semi regular basis and am not addicted, and I've known parents do way worse before finding out they're pregnant... cannabis is legal for medical reasons and there is something called a CanCard out now whereby the police aren't able to take away your cannabis if you have any, so it seems very conflicting how they treat people.

Anyone been in this situation before who doesn't feel comfortable commenting, send me a message please 🙂",4,29,2020-12-26,full term birth,278,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,Freaking out - Paxil,"Hi y’all. I had my first prenatal appointment today (via phone) and I’m freaking out. I’m on Paxil for PTSD, and apparently that’s the one SSRI that increases the risk of heart defects in babies. Obviously she called in an alternative SSRI, and I will never take Paxil again, but I’m still worried.

Another thing thats bothering me is she’s dating my pregnancy at 10 weeks. I just got my first squinter a week ago, and I’d been testing daily! My last period was on 2/19, so that’s how she’s dating the pregnancy, but I was getting negatives for all of March and April until the 26th. Could I have been pregnant for 2 months while getting BFNs?!? If so, isn’t that worse for my baby bc I’ve been unknowingly taking Paxil, a harmful drug, for 2 months while pregnant???

Any words of wisdom would be helpful. I’m just so worried for this little bean :(",4,8,2020-05-05,PTSD pregnancy,156,,,,,,,,,

I am pregnant the second time. 7 weeks, so it is still early.
Now I am concerned that I could suffer early delivery again like I did during the first time.

Background:
My first pregnancy in 2016 was with di-di twins. 
I was doing good in the beginning, no servere morning sickness, all values good.
In week 29 my gyn discovered that my cervix had shortend to 14mm (if I recall correctly) and I had early contractions.
I was admitted to the hospital immediately, put on best rest, received meds to stop the labor (tokolyse, if this is an english term at all?). I also received antibiotics as there seems to have been an infection.
Well, from week 30 on my amniotic fluid got lower and lower.There was probably a leakage in one of the sacks. 
Also, my cervix just ""vanished"" over the time. It was down to 4mm.
At 32 wks the twins were delivered via c-section.

The hospital told me I had a cervix insufficiency.


How likely is it that this will happen again this time? Was it just bad luck, or because of twins? 
Should I mentally prepare myself for long bed rest and a NICU stay?


I will obvl discuss this with my doc, but the next appointment is in 3 weeks and I am just nervous and worried.

AskDocs,"Reaction to epidural during labor (Horner syndrome), is this common and likelihood of recurrence?","31 year old female, currently 24 weeks pregnant with second child. 5’2 130 lbs with history of scoliosis. 

I am currently pregnant with my second child and plan on a scheduled c section since my last birth in 2016 ended up a c section. I was originally induced and opted for an epidural during my labor. The epidural was placed by a resident with his attending guiding him. He told me he hit CSF and it was possible I would experience a headache from it (I never did). Not even 15 minutes later my eye began to droop and I developed patches of numbness on my breasts. Called in the nurse who then called anesthesiology to explain my symptoms, and within minutes the head of anesthesiology, the attending and the resident were back in the room. I was told I developed a reaction called “Horner syndrome” likely because I was given a bolus of meds in the epidural and had a reaction. They told me that I was fine since I was not in respiratory distress and made it seem like this was NBD and even common? Like “oh you’re fine just horners syndrome, no more bolus though!” But it was kind of scary and I thought I was having a stroke. Then to find out I could have had respiratory distress from this was scary too. The drooping and numbness resolved within hours and I was fine. I wound up with a c section due to failure to progress, and while being prepped in the OR I told them I could feel everything on my left side. The OR anesthesiologist then sat me up to look at my epidural and told me it was completely coiled, placed badly, that I have bad scoliosis and the other option was to do a spinal and if that didn’t work I’d need general. Luckily the spinal worked. 

Anyway my question is now that I am being scheduled for a repeat c section is it likely this is going to happen again? Is Horner syndrome from an epidural really that common because my OB nurse told me she’d never seen it before and I haven’t found much in doing my own research on the topic.",4,3,2020-08-03,induced labor,372,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Birth: Pain Between Contractions,"I (28F) gave birth to my daughter in December 2018, so she's almost 1 and 1/2. I still occasionally have panic attacks when I think about her birth, particularly the pain during the last two hours of pushing.

The context: My water broke spontaneously, but after 10 hours of intense labor, I was still just at 2cm. They then injected me with something to induce me, and things progressed more quickly. Also, my daughter was ""sunny side up"" and a month early. I had a failed epidural, and wasn't offered anything else for pain.

It took two hours of pushing to get her out. The worst part was this HORRIBLE pain between contractions: it felt like my back was being split open and my legs torn off. The pain would start as one contraction was ending, and end as soon as the next one began. Because the contractions were the ""resting"" time for me, I was falling asleep and hallucinating while pushing, then the pain would come back. I could have never imagined enduring and surviving such pain.

I thought I would ask here, because I haven't been able to find a mention of anything online, and my friend who's a midwife (with her Master's) hadn't heard of anything like this.

PregnancyUK,Has anyone got any experience of perinatal mental health teams?,"TW: depression, suicidal ideation and thoughts of not wanting to continue with my pregnancy

May be a bit of a deep topic but an important one none the less. 

I have chronic mental health conditions. Severe depression, anxiety and potential PTSD. A lot of trauma in my past around my relationship with my own mother. 

It took me a very long time to manage my mental health prior to becoming pregnant. Lots of trial and error with meds and finding the right counsellor. 

Right before lockdown I finally saw a NHS psychologist (I feel I should play the lottery because I think it would have been easier to win at at that than actually have input from the NHS mental health service!) And I was diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder prior to lockdown too. Been waiting for some specific psychodynamic counselling since. I'll probably still be waiting for it a loong time too.

I am now pregnant and this baby is very much wanted and loved and planned for but I am struggling again and feeling so vulnerable and having conflicting thoughts.

I made the decision to come off my medication for less risk to the baby, so going through withdrawal for that on top of new symptoms and hormones that I have no patience for (you may think it silly but I will have panic attacks if it takes me 20 minutes longer than normal to sleep so this nausea and bloating is driving me insane). I've not had any counselling since lockdown either as my counsellor stopped seeing people due to risk and doesn't do telephone appointments so there's that too. 

The past two nights I have gotten so low that I had feelings of not wanting to be here. Of thinking I can't do this. Of spiralling and trying to think of any negative there could be. I even googled process of how to get an abortion and told my partner I think I have to do that because I can't cope anymore. When I get like this I have severe panic attacks where I hyperventilate and it takes my partner a long long time to calm me down.

I feel so so ashamed and so worried my baby may sense that I even contemplated those thoughts even though I know that's not possible at this point as I am only 4w3d. I feel shameful to admit this on here. 

I DO want my baby and I love my baby so much already. I just feel a lot of struggle managing at the moment and getting through this pregnancy. I also know that I would be a high risk of postnatal depression considering my history.

I am aware that there is a thing called a perinatal mental health service. But my experience of being fobbed off with the NHS MH service makes me feel unsure of what to expect.

AskDocs,Thoracic Aoritc Aneurysm: How terrified should I actually be?,"So last month I almost died from diabetic ketoacidosis. Before that I didn't even know I was diabetic. Still waiting on test results to rule out T2 vs LADA.  In the process of doing a CT scan during that whole thing they accidentally found a 4.5cm aneurism on my ascending aorta. I'm not sure if it's relevant or not but I had a stress test and echocardiogram almost exactly a year prior with no note of any such thing (I'm not sure if that's something you'd actually detect with an echocardiogram though?) 

The notes from the hospital say there is no significant stenosis and my arteries are parent. But I did have severe pre-eclampsia and HELLP with my daughter 5 years ago. My blood pressure never really went back to normal after that and I've been on meds since (although for a period at first I was not very good about them). 

One thing I noticed when I was in the ICU was that my BP was actually quite low. I kept asking them if they had given me my BP meds because it was sort of alarming to me. Usually if I don't take my meds it will shoot up. They hadn't and they just kept shrugging it off like it was irrelevant (maybe it was but it bothered me and no one ever gave me an explanation for it)

I also had what I thought per my now former family doctor was asthma or a type of reactive airway disease. I get these bouts where my chest or lungs kind of squeeze and then I cough and it squeezes more, round we go. Sometines it down we come with an obvious URI but other times it's been mid summer and I don't have any other symptoms of a chest cold. This happened actually right before I ended up in the hospital and I was given a 10 day course of prednisone (something that I've had many times before) which is probably what really took my blood sugar over the edge. The attending in the hospital (who was a pulmonologist apparently) was very clear I don't have and he said my symptoms were caused by postnasal drip and GERD. I do have a postnasal drip but I've never really had heartburn in my life before the ketoacidosis outside of pregnancy. 

I have an appointment with a cardiologist coming up in November. That's a pretty fast turnaround for a specialist around here but it's an eternity for me. I'm really stressed out about it (which doesn't help I'm sure) I'm a single mom of the most amazing 5 year old girl in the universe and I don't want to drop dead. Dr. Google only makes me more anxious. 

I'm almost 43. I'm 5'4"" and now about 190lbs. I dropped about 50 lbs in the maybe 2-3 months right before I wound up in the hospital (probably should have been a clue something was wrong). My blood sugar is now perfect and well controlled with insulin and diet. Besides the preeclampsia the only other thing I can think of that could be relevant is a history of anxiety disorders (which is probably obvious lol).

So I'm currently 37+5 and I'm trying to decide if I want to Induce or not. For some backstory, I went into preterm labor at 34 weeks, 50% effaced and 2 cm dilated. We expected me to go into labor by now, but I haven't. 

My husband just started a new DoD job and hasn't been on long enough to take paternity leave, however he can go into ""the hole.""

As a civilian, he earns 2.5 days of leave per month, so if he took two weeks it would take a few months to make up. HOWEVER, with the current pandemic he is working two weeks on two weeks off. During his two weeks off, he's on administrative leave and still earns a paycheck and leave time without taking personal leave. 

If I talk to my OB about induction this week, I could Induce at 39 weeks and husband would get two weeks off.

They never massaged my stomach after birth, even with the PPH. They served food with mold all over it. I gave birth a year ago and I’m still sad about my experience.

AskDocs,Hydrocephalus,"Also posted in  r/Medical

I (40F) have congenital hydrocephalus. My last shunt revision was in 1994! I was discharged as a paediatric patient and never had a new neurosurgeon after that.

In 2018 I was suffering migraines and sent for a CT which came back clear. It turns out I was in early stages of pregnancy and developed gestational diabetes early on and needed insulin. The diabetes disappeared after the birth. The diabetes and pregnancy seemed to account for my symptoms as I felt better after I was on insulin and the birth. I delivered via elective c-section as they felt that was safer than labouring or pushing for hours.

However, I am still having headaches and migraines, especially lately. I strongly feel I need an MRI and feel I need a new shunt. I'm not sure if it's a blockage but could I have a cyst or perhaps an infection? Are VP shunts meant to last a lifetime? I just don't feel right. I have written to the hospital I was originally treated in but the notes I received are incomplete. I only know it's a Delta shunt but nothing more. It isn't a programmable shunt, as far as I know. But until doctors know more, they refuse to do an MRI in case it is dangerous? or intervenes with my shunt type. I feel very abandoned and helpless.

I'm not in US. Anyone any advice or experience. My GP did send a referral to a neurosurgeon but due to COVID 19 I'm still waiting. I feel cognitively something isn't right. It's taking an age to type this.",3,1,2020-06-08,gestational age,269,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Cardiac surgery and feeding issues,"I know I post way too much here by now but I have a few feeding questions and any input would be greatly appreciated. I have a 43 week old (born at 39 weeks so technically not a preemie but small for gestational age) who recently had heart surgery a little over 3 weeks back. He has taken a good amount of formula and donor milk through a bottle before surgery but now he takes 99% of his feeds through the ng tube. I call and ask every day how his feeds are progressing but I have the feeling its just easier for the nurses to leave him on the ng feeds then it is to work with a fussy baby to take his feeds through a bottle but that really, really scares me because while he has made some progress in his feeding so far (he didn't used to be able to take bolus feeds but now he keeps them down) I'm worried I might have to take him home with either the ng tube or a gtube.

Its hard for me to be there for him because me and my husband share a car and he works most of the day but I'm going to try and stay longer to supervise his feeding and try the bottle feeding myself (He only takes just under 10 mls sadly) because I'm more willing to work through his fussiness because he's my child and I'm his only real advocate. I can't stand the thought of him lying there with an ng tube damaging his intestines knowing that if I were there maybe he would eat more. Every time I've held him so far he seemed to move closer to my breast, I know his ability to suck and swallow is there and I've even seen drink a bottle before with no issue. Can anyone give me advice on what to do? Techniques to try? What I should ask of the nurses? Will I have to accept the reality that he will need to come home with the tube?

I am on a low dose of Effexor and it's done so much for my mental health and wellbeing. My own mother has a history of postpartum depression and I believe I may be predisposed to the same experience. 

We're planning on conceiving in the next couple of years and I am interested in learning of other women's experiences  (whether you weaned off or stayed on,  and what the experience was like).

Edit: wow thank you so much everyone for sharing your experiences and stories. 

I'm feeling a lot more relieved knowing that staying on the medication is an option.

NICUParents,Fortifier woes!,"Can anyone give me your tips for getting your baby to take fortified milk that they don’t like?

Some backstory:

My 28-weeker came home a few weeks ago. We were told to fortify half his feeds (so, 4 bottles a day) to 24 calories. He had some weight loss in the NICU from being on IVs during an episode of bloody stools, so he’s still gaining “catch up” weight.

He’s got a dairy allergy, so we’re using Elecare. He hates it. He doesn’t like the taste, it makes him horrifically gassy, his poops are watery and stress him to the point of giving him bloody stool. We tried Alimentum, and he didn’t like that either.

We did a trial run with just nursing for five days, and he was like a different baby. Less gas, settling at night. But, he didn’t gain enough - only 3 ounces in 5 days. The doctor wants him to jump weight percentiles to catch up on a weight loss he had while still in the NICU.

We’ve tried feeding him in a bouncer seat to distract him a little, which seems to work the best. Anything else is an hour of spluttering, choking, crying, spitting, to get down *maybe* 40mL. We were told to try for 60 at a minimum per fortified feeding, but he just shuts down and won’t do it. Even if he’s hungry.

Any suggestions/tips? Editing to add, his current gestational age is 43 weeks. So I think he’s a little too young to try something like oatmeal, although the doctor suggested I could do that in another month.",3,3,2020-07-01,gestational age,268,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Missing period but no chance of being pregnant?,"I’m 18F, 5’2”, somewhere between 8st 9lb & 8st 12lb, white. I don’t smoke, I drink occasionally but not very often and I don’t drink large amounts. I don’t use any recreational drugs.
Current medications (all prescribed): oxycodone 2.5ml (i take it when pain is insanely bad), nefopam 60mg, amitriptyline 50mg, sertraline 150mg, melatonin 4mg, propranolol 80mg modified release & 40mg immediate release, fludrocortisone 0.1mg, norethisterine 0.35mg & naproxen 500mg (i don’t take naproxen very regularly).
Diagnosed medical issues: scoliosis, a syrinx in my spinal cord, spondylolisthesis, degenerative L5-S1 disc, sinus tachycardia, chronic hypotension, vasodepressor syncope & depression. I will soon be having genetic testing for ehlers danlos syndrome.

Anyway, onto my problem. So obviously from the info above I take norethisterine, which is a ‘mini pill’, basically the birth control pill without oestrogen. I’ve been taking it for a long time and I’m on it to help with my periods because before they were extremely heavy and would often last longer than average. I know that something this pill can do is stop periods entirely, but i must’ve been on this pill for over a year now and I would still bleed monthly, just not for as long and they would be a bit less heavy. This was the norm until recently, I know that i’m way overdue for my period but there hasn’t been anything of the sort for probably 1.5-2 months now. Ive had spot breakouts which i generally get around the time of my period but haven’t bled at all. I haven’t been sexually active for over a year if that information is helpful. I’m not sure whether i should be concerned about it or if it’s just the result of the norethisterine, it just seems odd because the pill has never stopped my periods fully in the year i’ve been taking it.

AskDocs,Frequent bruising from unknown origins,"Female, 30, 5’6”, 118lbs, light smoker, occasional drinker. Medications are Sertraline 100mg, Adderall 30mg XR and 20mg IR 1-2x a day prn. I also take a prenatal vitamin, magnesium 250mg, and iron 60mg daily.


As long as I can remember I’ve always bruised super easily. My legs and arms were/are constantly covered in bruises. I’m a stay at home mom so I don’t do much, especially with COVID, so I don’t see how these  recent bruises could be from trauma. 

During my pregnancy, I was anemic so I was instructed to take an iron supplement daily. I had CBC’s done pretty regularly, and after taking an iron supplement without it improving my HCT, I was then instructed to take iron twice a day. My HCT was still going down. The last CBC I had done was a day after my c-section, and I was still anemic (no doctor told me about this, I just saw it from looking at my lab work through my patient portal). I was never instructed to follow up, and being a brand new parent, I didn’t even think of it. I also know being anemic isn’t very uncommon during pregnancy. Before my pregnancy I never got lab work done regularly, but I did a few times throughout the years and my HCT was always WNL. Not sure if any of this is even relevant.

I haven’t been to a PCP in 10+ years, and finally have an appointment to get myself established next month. What type of testing should I bring up? I also have some symptoms of ehlers danlos classical type. My symptoms are hyper elastic skin, very soft velvety skin, and hyper-extendable joints without dislocating, just to name a few. My joints are often achey and have crepitus, but it’s not debilitating and NSAIDS help. I also have scoliosis with a 23 degree angle in my lumbar spine. I haven’t followed up with my scoliosis since my teenage years.

 (Beside some seafood reaction and mild come and go eczema, never have any other allergy or problems)

So it started out in early June (second trimester), I noticed some rash going on underneath my breast and few days later some pustules formed around the area (I found myself more sweaty there) . Then the next few days it spreads to around the belly. It's not itchy nor burning, just very gross looking. [1](http://imgur.com/a/WtZTbwJ) [2](http://imgur.com/a/yFHwarx)

My ob gave me some anti fungal cream which kind of stopped it from spreading, however a 2 weeks later it came back again and spreading slowing to thighs and arms, especially underneath the breast. It's a bit itchy but I can manage myself not to scratch it.

The same time some little red bumps showed up on my arms that's super itchy. But after I tried my best not to scratch it, it just became normal except leaving a rough surface. [3](http://imgur.com/a/n1qaaLv)

I went to the dermatologist and she did a skin biopsy on my thigh (which was at first itchy and then suddenly lot of pustules formed within a day or two) [4](http://imgur.com/a/YZ1U1bm) It is "" mixes infiltrate with papillary dermal edema, spongiosis, and subcorneal pustule formation"" And she told me to stop using the anti fungal cream just keep the area clean and dry since not sure what it is.

But after that it got a lot worse, it's spread to everywhere (except my face , hands and feet) and became bigger area with dark red rash underneath. My thigh was the worst, it feels like burning and tingling, so it's hard to walk too. [today, same biopsy site](http://imgur.com/a/lSH2fKi)

She gave me Keflex antibiotics and now I'm on 6th day, it's not improving and most area are still spreading. I had the worse night ever last night because most places just have burning tingly sensation, plus it's all over my belly and thigh, so it hurts a lot when trying to move around.

Called my dermatologist this morning, she said bacterial culture came back negative, still waiting for DIF biosy result. But both her and my OB advised me to go to a university dermatology since it seems pretty rare.

AskDocs,"32M, premature ventricular contractions at 82 BPM vs 108 BPM","Premature ventricular contractions vs 110BPM

I have lots of health problems but this worries me the most. I'm 32, 6'4"" 290lbs down from 329. I quit soda entirely 8 months ago, after going from 2x 2 liter of mountain dew a day for years, down to 1x 2 liter of cola a day, then for the last year and a half of drinking soda, 3 cans of cola a day. These last 8 months I've been sooooo good, my wife and I both switched to completely unsweetened lightly flavored Seltzer's like ""Aha"" brand. I drink 8-12 cans a day.

I have numerous psychological disorders but the ones that affect me physically the most are anxiety and PTSD. 

Before I became aware that my resting heart beat is an average of 108BPM, my previous doctor diagnosed me with PVC. I've also had high blood pressure in the past but now I'm only slightly on the high side of normal. She decided to treat me for anxiety in addition to my psych provider. I don't remember what the doc put me on but it caused excessive mood swings, made me sleep too much, exhausted, and psych discontinued it. Since then psych has become increasingly concerned about my heart. My new primary on the other hand remarks how high my heart rate is at the beginning of every appointment, then goes on as usual. At the behest of psych, I asked my primary for a Holter monitor, right as we were changing my meds around as I complained to psych about the PVC and was beginning to think it was one of the meds causing it. The med change here was coming off of Minipress (for PTSD night terrors) because psych thought that might be causing the PVC and by the time I got scheduled by the hospital outpatient lab and fitted with the Holter, PVC was gone and the 72 hour test was ""normal"". 

Now: I've been on clonodine for 2-3 weeks. My anxiety is slightly better according to my wife (she says I pick less) but the PVC is back with a vengeance! The fluttering 2-3 times a minute is keeping me awake at night and distracting me from Lambda School during the day. BUT my heart rate on the clonodine is an average of 82 BPM

I'll answer any and all questions! I want to live!

Other physical maladies:
GERD, IBS, degenerative disc disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (I don't drink), very high ANA but no diagnosed auto-immune disorder (possible Buschets if I'm spelling that right), gout (no symptoms just very high uric acid), and migraines. A severe case of periodic limb movement disorder affects my sleep. I do not have diabetes, my A1C is perfect, tested many times by several doctors in disbelief.

I smoked 2 packs a day from 13-26, non-smoker for 6 years now.

Meds:
Wellbutrin
Clonodine
Lyrica
Prevacid
Pepcid
Alipurinol
PRN Ativan
PRN Flexeril
PRN Maxalt

TL;DR: Which of them will kill me first? 108 BPM resting without clonodine, or 82 BPM resting on the clonodine but with PVC 2-3 times a minute?",3,3,2020-10-16,prematurity,517,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Next step - failed weight loss surgery,"Hello, please know I am an open book and whiling to answer questions but the answer to my question isn’t “higher output then input” if this is your answer please respect I won’t reply. 

I am a 29y female 120kg(260lb), 5’ tall, PCOS with infertility, asthma when playing sports or in cold conditions, currently coming off Escitalopram with a history of steroid use for body building. Caucasian.

In 2015 I had weight loss surgery (gastric sleeve) to loss weight after gaining 50kg(110lb) in the space of 12 months (broken ankle requiring multiple surgeries and months of bed rest) and not being able to loose it at the advise of my then GP/PCP. Pre surgery I had to do a VLCD aka shake diet for 2 weeks in which I lost 3kg (which I believe was water weight as it was the first couple of days) then 2kg post surgery. 

It is coming up to 5 years and my weight has not moved, not a single kg/lb, I had a baby 6 months ago and walked out from having the baby at exactly (I cannot stress this enough) the same weight only gaining 4kg the day before having the baby(weekly weigh ins). I have spoken to a new go/pcp who simply advised I was over eating and not exercising enough. I have seen an endocrinologist who has tested me for many things, tried me on injections for weight loss which also did nothing, had me on excessively high calorie diet to see if I could gain weight which I didn’t and then excessively low calorie diet to loose weight again which I didn’t. I have been advised my next step would be to have gastric bypass surgery which I personally don’t feel like would work as I am not an over eater. 

A brief history, I have always been short I am 5’ (151cm) extremely fit and weighing in around 50kg (110lb) for most of my life, as well as an ex body builder in the bikini division where I did take an illegal substance Clenbuterol during my last competition I am not sure if this is a factor. I have also had PCOS since I was 14 with a period every 6 months for 2 days but fell pregnant with my son at 19. But with this baby was 2 years of trying with fertility medication. My blood pressure has always been reasonably low (even during pregnancy) 100/50?, do not have fatty liver, hba1 4.2, low cholesterol.  Not sure if it is relevant but my pregnancy ended in waters breaking at 31 weeks.  

An example of my diet is coffee for breakfast, either a sausage or chicken sandwich for lunch, dinner, and a snack size packet of chips for dessert. I cannot consume more then a fist sized amount of food. 

So basically I am unsure how to proceed. I understand I will not return to the small person I was but physically my body is suffering and I would like to loose a reasonable amount.",3,7,2020-05-20,stress during pregnancy,506,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Eye Twitching for Seven Months Straight,"29F, 5’2, 160lb

My upper right eyelid has been twitching every few minutes while awake for over seven months now (it lets up at night). I had a full physical and eye exam last Feb, when the twitching had been happening for about a month. Clean bill of health minus slightly high cholesterol. I was told it’s multi-factorial caused by all the following:
Sleep deprivation from new baby
Stress/anxiety (I have GAD)
I work in advertising and can spend easily 10+ hours a day in front of a computer. 
And the cherry on top, I have very stubborn eczema on my eyelids that flared up during pregnancy (treating and mostly cleared up, but chronically irritated eyelids). 

My doctor recommended trying to relax and sleep more and stare at the computer less. I’ve managed to accomplish 2 of the 3 - taking breaks from my work is a challenge. I’ve since moved states and the twitching has kept on keeping on. I have no other concerning vision/neurological symptoms. The twitching has stayed consistently the same. 

The twitching has become a source of anxiety in itself and Dr Google is not good company. Is it possibly something more sinister that I should be worrying about at this point? Haven’t setup with a new physician yet.",3,5,2020-08-14,stress during pregnancy,213,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,? About folic acid deficiency,"Hi there - I have a few simple questions. (27f) 170lb, white. Current meds: lexapro 10mg daily, iron 325mg daily, omeprazole daily, folic acid daily, vitamin d2 weekly, melatonin as needed, zofran as needed. Prior dx: ptsd, depression, iron deficiency anemia, and ibs-d

Been thru the ringer w random symptoms over the past few years. Mainly dizziness, joint pain, headaches, fatigue, rashes, and two short bouts of vision loss. However that’s not why I’m here. 

My pcp ran B and D vitamin panels recently to examine whether my history of alcoholic abuse left me with any long lasting deficiencies that could explain my symptoms. She found that I have a vitamin D2 deficiency as well as folic acid very very low. Since we weren’t discussing my period bc we were focused on other stuff I didn’t get a chance to ask her this, which is why I’m here: 

Is it possible that my periods are very light (3 days max, very light flow) because of the folic acid deficiency?

AskDocs,"Hi, I'm 32F, and I have unintentional weight loss, and docs can't figure out what's wrong.","I went to my pcp back in June when I first noticed this because I dropped down to 118lb from 125 in maybe a year — I'm not actually sure when it happened as I wasn't weighing myself. Anyway, he ran a whole bunch of tests — CBC, inflammatory markers, A1c, metabolic panel, thyroid, celiac, abdominal ultrasound, lung x-ray — all came back normal. He said it was probably stress, and to keep an eye on it and see if it happens again. And if so, he would send me to an endocrinologist because he didn't know. I do have anxiety and a lot of stress, but I've been stressed my whole life (diagnosed with OCD) and I've never lost weight before. I was also struggling with infertility and in the process of doing an IUI at the time, and was advised to go ahead and keep doing that.

So anyway, I kept an eye on it, started exercising more to help with stress. My weight actually went up a couple of pounds, so I thought the problem was done with. The IUIs didn't work, so insurance finally approved a round of IVF. I did an egg retrieval — weight still good. Then I started prepping for a transfer cycle. Around a week before my transfer, my weight suddenly started dropping again. I was on Estrace, and had just started Crinone and Progesterone in Oil, and was on several other supplements, and I thought they were responsible. Fast forward 2 weeks — I've done my transfer, and it stuck! Which is amazing after four years of infertility. However, my weight is still dropping, and I don't know what the hell is wrong. In 2-3 weeks, I've lost about 5 pounds. And this is obviously causing an insane level of stress, especially now that I'm hopefully actually pregnant.

The fertility clinic did another thyroid test and said my tsh was a bit low (.02) and they sent me to an endocrinologist, who did a full panel of thyroid tests (still waiting for those) but said that level of tsh is perfectly acceptable in pregnancy. And that if my thyroid isn't the problem, she can't help me. I'm at a complete loss at this point, as my PCP also told me to see the endo if this keeps happening (and my thyroid was all in range at the time!), and she doesn't seem to think it's my thyroid and she can't help with anything else? I literally have no idea what's wrong. I mean I'm going to wait for the results, obviously, but she doesn't seem to think my thyroid is the problem. And if it isn't, what doctor I should see then?? Should I go back to my PCP and have him send me somewhere else? I don't have any other symptoms of anything that I can think of — except according to my apple watch history, my resting heart rate has increased slightly for the same time frame as this weight loss, and I'm wondering if it's related. I did mention this to the endo, and she had no comment.

I will also note that I had a previous molar pregnancy and 8 months of chemo treatment with  methotrexate and then act-d, though I'm hoping this is not in any way related. I did not lose any weight during that time.

Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions? Anything?

AskDocs,Pediatric question: My 2 year old toddler refuses to squat for #2,"A little background:

My 2 year old was born 9 weeks early due to me having preeclampsia, which resulted in IUGR for her - she stopped growing in utero at 29w, born at 31+1. 

She caught up with all milestones except for weight/height percentiles at about 1 year old.

She’s not potty-trained. This is just a diaper issue.

I’ve tried reasoning, I’ve tried suggesting showing her toys how we squat to poo, I’ve tried putting her in the squatty potty position in my lap to try and help her out, but none of it is working. 

She does a pretty good job of staying hydrated throughout the day, and we give her a decent variety of fiber-containing foods. 

What happens when she normally tries to go is that she will stand stiff as a board, and get on hir tiptoes to push it out....super counter-productive. 

My best guess is that she had lots of really bad diaper rashes when she was an infant (thanks, extra calorie preemie formula), and she maybe got scarred mentally from the pain of those? 

I’m not sure if this is normal, something that just clicks when she’s ready to potty train, or something else entirely.

AskDocs,"If I got a fever after a tetanus booster as a child, will I get a fever any time I get a tetanus booster as an adult?","Hello. I am 25F, 120 pounds and 5’4”. I have no health issues and live in the US. I don’t smoke, drink, or do any recreational drugs. I’m not really having an issue per say but I’m just curious as to what to expect.

I have been way overdue for a tetanus shot (last shot was 14 years ago), and after getting a second degree burn on my arm today, I decided it was time to get it done because I’ve had a lot of anxiety after getting wounds lately due to fear of tetanus. So after a teledoc appointment, I went to the pharmacy and got my tetanus booster 4 hours ago.

The reason it has taken me so long to get it is because I remember getting a fever as a child after my vaccine, and I have not wanted to have to miss work/other events due to having a fever and feeling sick. Now that I have gotten the shot, I worry that if I develop a fever, I might have to take off time from work until I can get tested for Covid, as well as test negative. I am a teacher, and my first day of work is on Thursday. 

I know that knowing if I will or won’t develop a fever based on my past experience won’t change anything, but I’d like to be prepared to make a plan. Is it likely that if I got a fever from the booster as a child, I will get a fever now after getting the shot?",3,2,2020-09-01,overdue,260,,,,,,,,,
PregnancyUK,Really going wrong,"I’m so sorry but this is a rant. So I’m in for my induction today and my partner didn’t come because he has a swollen back. For months I said I should pick a backup person and he said no because he’ll be there. And now I’m just panicking in a hospital crying. To top it all off he’s just messaged to say he had to put one of his pet birds down and went into extreme detail. I’m a sobbing mess, I’m scared, and honestly at this point I don’t know what to do. I do wish he was here but I don’t really want to talk to him any more.

Update: 
I’m not sure if anyone will read this but I wanted to say thank you, you’re encouragement helped a lot. I was moved to the labour ward this morning after a panic attack. I didn’t think I could do it and was going to wait but the midwife told me it would decrease my daughters chances, so I womaned up and went in. I was still freaking out and managed to sort a back up person after the long attempt to get a cannula in my arm (it did take multiple tries and I’m not gonna lie there was a lot of blood). After that my waters were broken and I started having contractions. The machine that registered them was not picking them up but I was in so much pain I was screaming. I was offered an epidural and I did want one however they couldn’t pick up her heart beat anymore and had to put a monitor near her head. Just before this with each contraction I started pretty much screaming “I need a shit”. They went to put the monitor on and realised I could start pushing. From then it was about 20 minutes of pushing. The whole process only took an hour. I didn’t get any drugs in the end because the gas and air didn’t agree with me and the others they had prepped too late. I couldn’t have done it without the amazing team of midwives and I’m kind of thankful for not having a person I knew there, it proved to me that I could do anything. So if anyone reads this and is going through induction, or doing labour alone, you can do it, I believe in you, and I know it will go just as well for you as it did for me ❤️❤️❤️

Extra update:
I even cut the cord and tbh that felt great too ❤️❤️❤️

Ps: 
This isn’t pregnancy related but I wanted to remind you guys because I forgot. after you’ve given birth trust your instincts. My daughter wasn’t feeding and only 2 midwives took my concerns seriously. She went from a freezing screaming but very sleepy baby who couldn’t fill a nappy, to a warm content bubba after some formula. I felt something was wrong and had to talk to over 10 midwives before someone saw my concern and saw she was dehydrated. The second midwife helped even more and now the two of us have even slept a lot more which is making us less stressed. Please trust yourself a before, during, and after birth, and remember midwives are there to help, even if it takes awhile to find one who will fully listen ❤️❤️❤️",3,15,2020-11-09,late pregnancy,563,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Should I be concerned about getting rabies?,"29 / USA / Male

I was playing with one of my friends dogs today and had this pull toy we were doing a “tug of war” with. It was a complete accident, but the dog was biting and scratching as it was pulling on the toy and accidentally got me.

He’s a big dog and was slobbering everywhere and drew the tiniest amount blood from the bite/scratch (it happened so fast I’m not sure what caused it). 

My buddy apologized and I had no issue, we were just playing. I asked if the shots were up to date and he said yeah, but called the vet to confirm. 

The vet said the rabies had actually expired since he was due for one in July 2019. The dogs rabies vaccines history is -

-	August 2012
-	July 2013
-	July 2016

So, while the dog is overdue for the vaccine and needed one in July 2019, it’s had three shots in its life. My buddy is super apologetic and his dog is indoors like 99% of the time and he’s getting the booster shot on Monday, but what does that mean for me?

Is there any risk I could get rabies if the dog had recently been exposed to something in the last year?

Hypothetically speaking, how long would it take to know if I’m going to be okay or not? Can my buddy watch the dog or does it need to be quarantined?

I know I’m probably over reacting but I wanted to ask. Thanks!",3,16,2020-06-20,overdue,257,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Choking from birth injury? Any pediatricians out there?,"12 months, female, 21lbs, 30.8 inches. Takes famotidine 1ml twice a day for reflux. During my labor and delivery with her she continuously had heart decelerations and while I was pushing her heart rate was undetected altogether even on an internal monitor. She was fine was out but weighed 5lbs 14oz. I was volunteerly induced because my midwife told me there was virtually no risk. (Which I quickly discovered during the process was not true) A few hours after her birth the nurse notice she was very lethargic,  after testing her sugar and taking her temp they put her under a warmer and we decided to give her some formula. Within about 4 hours she was doing much better. The second or third night home while laying on her back, swaddled, and in a crib she started choking. I brought this up to the doctor who thought nothing of it. I also brought up to her that we were having trouble with nursing on one side and she told me I just ""need to relax."" 

At 5 weeks she was diagnosed with a dairy intolerance and we switched to soy formula (supplementing) and I cut out dairy. This diagnosis was based on mucus in stoll and not on the choking. She continued having choking episodes and even vomiting sometimes. At 7 weeks she was diagnosis with torticollis and we began PT.  After some PT she has full range of motion.  The choking continued and we finally got a referral to a gastroenterologist. He ordered a swallow study and found she was protecting her airway.  He also diagnosed her with a soy intolerance because of frequent skin rashes.

I think it is important to state here that the test was only 1 minute long and the radiologist complained about being there. She also didn't choke during it. 

Because there was no aspirating detected he prescribed her famotidine and it has never really worked. It helps but she still frequently chokes after drinking anything and she wakes frequently from sleep choking and gasping for air. 

At 7 months old she started doing these weird movements that we and her pediatrician were concerned was infantile spasms. We quickly got her in for a 48 hour EEG. This showed not seizure activity  and we were told it could be sandifer syndrome. 

Fast forward to her next GI appointment we ask about it and he isn't too concerned. Next appointment which we just had at 12 months he suggested we do an endoscopy and ph test to see what's going on. We will be doing those at the end of the month. 

I almost guarantee I am forgetting to add something here. If I remember anything I will edit to add. My question is are we looking in all the wrong places? It's been a year and we still have no real answers. Is she aspirating and they didn't catch it on the swallow study? She frequently sounds raspy after choking and her breathing sounds wet if that makes sense. Could this be related to her lack of detectable heartrate at birth? Possible birth injury? Or could it be something really simple we just aren't seeing? Any input would be appreciated.

AskDocs,Arrhythmia in pregnancy,"25 yo F
~170 lbs
31 weeks pregnant
History of anxiety and POTS
Non smoker 
Regular prenatal care 

OB sent me to cardiology for some follow up after I had a bad dizzy spell I attributed to POTS. Cardiology did an echo which came back completely normal. Put me on a 2 week heart monitor to be sure expecting it to come back normal. I was in sinus rhythm as expected and some sinus tach (expected—my resting heart rate during my second trimester was often between 110-130). But I had several runs of SVT and one brief run of v tach. I also had some PACs and PVCs.

As a former L&D nurse I understand just enough of this to make me stress. He thinks it is pregnancy induced and said my heart is healthy, just my body is going through a lot (I also had HG and stayed dehydrated a lot of my pregnancy—even ended up on fluids). I will repeat the tests after I deliver and he expects the problems to be resolved. 

I will follow up with OB of course, but my appointment is over a week away and I’m starting to stress. What could this do to my pregnancy? Increased risk for IUGR, pre e?! Will I need to be induced? If so, when? C section or can I deliver vaginally? What is the current recommendations for delivering patients with these types of arrhythmia?

Is it petty of me to not want to talk about the pregnancy much and wear loose fitting clothing as I don’t want their attention. They make me very uncomfortable because I know they don’t like me much for essentially who I am. I don’t want to show them my scan pictures or even discuss the nursery and I don’t want to hear their advice. Everytime they come up in our conversation, my husband gets worked up and I just want to keep the peace. I’m trying to push through my anxiety and depression but they really don’t help me feel better. They’ll probably want to have us over for Christmas and I really hate the idea.

Essentially as the title says, I had a PPH with my recent delivery. I have VWD so I basically had a 1 in 4 chance of it happening. I lost 750ml immediately after delivery, and was treated with tranexamic acid, syndometrine, misoprostol and ergometrine

About 2h later they got me up to go to the shower and I had a secondary bleed. I lost a lot of blood in the shower that we weren't able to measure, but what we were able to measure was another 250ml minimum, as well as some large clots. A doctor was called and I was given more tranexamic acid and told that if the bleeding didnt stop in 10 minutes they would have to give me a general and go up to surgery to try to stop the bleeding. 

Fortunately my hemoglobin levels stayed okay through the whole thing and my recovery so I didnt need a transfusion but the whole thing was pretty traumatic and obviously I would like to avoid it where possible in future pregnancies. Is there anything I can do to prevent it in future? Would a C-Section be easier to manage because its a controlled wound as opposed to a vaginal delivery? Should I have been on a drip of the tranexamic acid for the delivery? Will I have a better shot at not having a PPH next time if the baby isnt as big?",3,1,2020-05-03,c-section delivery,264,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Sudden episodes where I can’t breathe a few times a year?,"Female, 34, 234 pounds, non-smoker. 


Sometimes, I can’t breathe randomly for 10-30 seconds until dry hack up a lung. Like I legit cannot inhale even a tiny bit. 

Happens a couple times a year for like the last 15 year when I’m both awake and asleep. Like I literally can’t inhale or speak. It’s always been when I’m asleep until last xmas where I had an episode in Costco over the holidays.

Bit of health background: I was 3 months premature at birth, but the doctors gave my mom a shot to develop my lungs and they’re generally good. Twice on my life I ended up on Advair when I lived in Asia. Once due to shadows in my lungs in the Middle East and the other in China due to allergies causing a secondary chest infection because of spring pollen and pollution. 

I do have allergies, I’m actually allergic to cats and own two who sleep with me. For the past two years o wake up some mornings wheezy. But the not breathing thing has been much longer than that. 

I had a breathing test in January and I didn’t meet the threshold for improvement with Ventolin to be labeled asthmatic, though there was some quantifiable improvement in the before/after comparison. My doctor didn’t know what else to label it as other than allergies.

NICUParents,Broke under the pressure to breast feed,"Today was an extremely rough day and I broke down in front of the physical therapist.

A little back story: My LO was born at 27+6 on July 31st due to unknown reasons. I went into preterm labor after a normal pregnancy with no issues on the 28th and they did everything possible to stop it but couldn't. I have been pumping since day 1 but since he was on the CPAP until a month ago, we have little practice with breast feeding. However, I do try to go to the NICU every day to try to breast feed or bottle feed at least once.

The hospital has all the pressure around breast feeding. I don't know how it is with other hospitals but this one really stresses it. They have lactation specialists, and even the physical therapists and speech therapists that see my son highly recommend it.

For the last week or so, my LO has not been latching well to my breast with or without a nipple shield and only takes a fraction of what he does with the bottle. It has been very discouraging and frustrating. I am able to pump almost twice as much as he needs per day so it's not a production issue.

Today, after yet another unsuccessful breast feeding session, I broke down in front of the physical therapist all because she asked how I was doing with the breast feeding. He has been in the NICU for over 70 days now and I just want him home, all he has to do to come home is eat enough through the nipple. Add that in with the breast feeding, I was at my wits end.

I don't know what to do. I am just so tired and overwhelmed. I never expected to be in this position or in the NICU at all.

Does any one else feel this pressure to perform when they can't when it comes to breast feeding?

Thanks for letting me rant. I'm going to try to get some sleep now until my next pumping session...

TLDR: The hospital's pressure to breast feed is overwhelming and exhausting.

EDIT: Part of my frustration was the physical therapist herself. I know she is just tying to help us. However, when I asked her the benefits of breast feeding vs bottle feeding my breast milk she said that there's something different that comes out when you breast feed that the pump can't get? And she started telling me about studies that were done and how it can minimize autism? I know understand how that can be true. And even if it was, our son being a preemie has such a higher chance of being on the spectrum.

Though I didn't really post, each story, heartwarming or scary really touched me. Everyone one of you are so damn strong and amazing parents. 
My NICU adventure was completely from left field. I was diagnosed with Preclampsia at full term (39.5 weeks) and was induced within hours of diagnosis. Baby boy was so healthy throughout pregnancy. Then during a long pushing process he suffered with shoulder Dystocia and lost oxygen. He was unresponsive when they laid him on my chest. 
He went from the 72hr cooling pad therapy, to oxygen, to feeding tube to now a normal baby. I'm so thankful our road wasn't as long as most ❤️
With all of that explained....to NICU parents who are home with their babies ...how did you feel?
I love my son. I've cried over my son. I love to bond with my son, whether that's when he latches or just holding him and hearing him breathe. 
He was discharged yesterday. And though I was, and am, so relieved..I thought I would be more excited. Now it's just pumping, changing, holding him and feeding him.
Family members keep asking if I cried tears of joy during discharge, and I didn't. 
I'm not sure if I just haven't had time to process but I'm just moving forward with our new life now. No NICU visit, scheduling early intervention, making sure he starts associating night time with longer naps...etc.
I can't help but feel like a bad mother..that I wasn't more excited or emotional.

AskDocs,Help determining date of conception,"26, female, 4 foot 10, 120lbs, Asian. I’m trying to verify the approximate date of conception of my pregnancy. I am currently about 8 months pregnant as far as I know. I had an unwanted sexual experience last September, and then had regular consensual sex with my husband in October. I found out I was pregnant in November and as far as I know the baby was conceived in October. I’m pretty sure it was, but I still get worried that something weird might have happened and caused ultrasounds or hcg levels to be off, like if my body produced hcg so slowly that it seemed like the baby was conceived in October but it was actually earlier? Is this possible?

Data points:  

* Period Sept 9-12 (sex Sept 12)  
* Possible period or spotting Oct 10 (31 day cycle)  
* Positive pregnancy test November 11  
* Quantitative HCG test Nov 12: 882.5 mIU/mL (5-6 weeks?)  
* Ultrasound Dec 20 placing me at 9w6d (expected 10+1 based on LMP)  
* Ultrasound Jan 3 placing me at 12w (expected 12+1)  
* Ultrasound Mar 4 placing me at 19w6d (expected 20+6)  
* Ultrasound Apr 16 placing me at 25w6d (expected 27w)  

A few more points:

* I have had periods ranging from 24-32 days but usually had regular periods around 28 days. I believe my LMP was Oct 10 which was a 31 day cycle from Sept 9-Oct 10. I don’t know if I remembered it correctly or if maybe it was some kind of early pregnancy spotting instead.  
* I took Plan B back in June which led to a couple very short cycles (15 and 19 days) before returning to normal length. I don’t know if that would affect my ovulation pattern.  
* I was taking Monistat before my September cycle hit and don’t know if that has any effect on ovulation timing either.  
* I have always been very petite and was less than 100lbs before pregnancy, I was born full term but physically “premature,” I don’t know if this would have any relation to a baby growing slowly.

No ultrasounds since then and I may not get another one. All the dates seems to indicate conception during October. I am told early ultrasounds are very accurate. But is there any unusual situations that could cause ultrasounds or HCG to be a month off when dating pregnancy? Does a gestational age of 10 weeks (like in my December ultrasound) always indicate conception around 8 weeks ago or is it possible to have conceived earlier than that? Or should I assume that it was definitely October?

AskDocs,"Short limbs on ultrasound, 38 weeks pregnant","My baby has been breech since around 32 weeks, but I’ve otherwise had an uneventful pregnancy. 

I am scheduled for a c-section tomorrow at 39 weeks and had a growth scan yesterday at 38+5 to check positioning and size before delivery. This was my first ultrasound since the anatomy scan at 20 weeks. I was told after my anatomy scan that everything was looking good and on track, but given no specific measurements. 

At my growth scan yesterday, I noted when she measured baby’s femur that it was showing on screen at 33 weeks + some number of days. The humerus also seemed to be measuring around 33 weeks. Head and abdomen measuring about 40 weeks. All of these values I read off the screen as she was measuring, I wasn’t provided with this info by the tech or anything. The tech did tell me that his estimated weight is 7lb 1oz and sent me on my way. 

I (of course) googled the femurs measuring so far behind and got results such as Down’s Syndrome and various forms of dwarfism. Cue me freaking out for the next 12 hours. 

I had my follow up appointment this morning and mentioned my concerns to my doctor regarding the femur and humerus lengths, and she said that they are measuring behind (again I wasn’t given exact values/percentiles/what GA they were measuring), but didn’t give me much indication what this means either way. She did say that if this had been seen at 30 weeks, for example, she may have referred me to MFM for more scans and genetic counseling if I would’ve wanted it, but that since we’re so close to delivering, it will be easier to assess baby once he’s here. 

She did say that she looked back at my anatomy scan and his femurs were 20-30th percentile then, and asked my height and my fiancé’s height. I’m 5’4”, he’s 5’7”. She suggested he could just be a short baby (although if he’s truly off by 5 weeks, that seems more significant to me than just being short) and that scans this late aren’t always accurate and his breech positioning may have played a role in this. She didn’t comment on other possibilities such as DS or dwarfism, just said we’d see him tomorrow and look him over. 

Can anyone speak to the level of concern I should have for a chromosomal or skeletal abnormality for our baby? We declined genetic screening in the first trimester because we have no family history and are both young (24 and 25), but now I’m regretting that a little bit. In your experience, would you have concern for fetal abnormalities?",2,4,2020-12-03,late delivery,445,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,How to proceed with trying to go back on Accutane...?,"Hello! 
I’m looking for advice because I’m a little lost at the moment. I (F18) have had pretty severe cystic acne for about six years now. I have been going to a dermatologist since I was 13, and was put on Accutane after we went through all of the other options. It cleared up my acne just fine. The only real side effect that bothered me was the chapped lips, but even that I could deal with. It was worth it to have clear skin. I stopped taking it and now my acne has come back. I’ve been off of it for about 3 years now, so I’m able to go back on it without time being a problem. I have talked to my dermatologist about it and she thinks it’s a good idea for me to try it again. The only issue is that now, since I have a gynecologist, I have to have her approve of me going back on Accutane. The first time I was on it, I did not need her approval for whatever reason (I believe age had something to do with it); all I needed from her was a prescription for birth control (Accutane can cause severe birth defects if I get pregnant while on it, so I must be on some form of birth control). I tried to get my gynecologist to sign off for me to start it again but she will not unless I get an IUD implant. I’m already on an oral birth control, so I’m not seeing the need for an IUD. My gynecologist said that her reasoning for giving this ultimatum is because she does not feel as though I should be on Accutane due to the side effects (but again, I was on it once before...), and because having an IUD implant would be basically 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. As a side note, I disagree with this last statement of hers because one of my best friends had an IUD, and was on a birth control pill, and still got pregnant with her second child. Additionally, I have never even had an exam done on my private area for personal reasons. I’m terrified to have someone touching me there, even a medical professional, because of insecurity about my appearance and because of some trauma I have had in my childhood. I would be scared to have an IUD put in for these reasons. My friend who has had one has also said that it was painful and uncomfortable for her. 
I’m wondering what my options would be for how to proceed. I really want to get back on Accutane because the acne is very painful and it makes me insecure about my appearance. I don’t feel as though it’s appropriate for my gynecologist to basically decide for me that I cannot be on it, considering that I’ve been on it before without an issue.

AskDocs,Spleen/abdominal issues,"Hi. 29F Caucasian. 5'9 193lbs. 

Doctors said I have had an enlarged spleen and liver for a prolonged amount of time. (They told me my spleen should be 10 in length at largest and mine is 14.5) I get reoccurent pain in the spleen area and sometimes to the navel. The pain can sometimes radiate upward as well. They found this on a scan to rule out kidney stones due to lower right flank pain three weeks ago. My primary doctor set me up with some bloodwork (CBC and rheumatoid arthritis testing) and they said both came back okay. They have been very vague on if I should worry or what this might be, only stating that by the CBC there is no reason to worry of leukemia or infection. Referred me to a gastrologist but the soonest I can be seen is October in my area. Do I have reason to worry? Is their anything specific I should be researching or is more likely that I have? The not knowing and waiting is very difficult, especially under my circumstances. 

Pre-existing conditions include: Neuropathy/Ridicopathy, Spinal Stenosis (lumbar), Slipped Disc (Thoracic), PMDD, OCD, PTSD. They also found a nodule on my lung and did a rescan a year later and saw no growtb, so told me it was nothing to be concerned about. I don't think this would have anything to do with it but I had three c sections in my life -- 2012, 2015, 2017. Last pregnancy I had the condition they labeled ICP (i don't know how to spell the condition name, told me it wouldn't effect me after pregnancy but it did involve the liver)

Family history: Cancer (Leukemia, Lung Cancer), Chrons Disease, Heart Disease, Angina, Tachycardia, Parkinson's Disease, Diverticulitis/osis, 

Medications include: Zoloft 100mg , hydroxizine half tab of lowest xozdw, clonidine half tab for lowest dose for mental illness relief and zofran for nausea

I do not drink, have probably drank a total of five times in my life and it was never more than a beer. I don't like the stuff. I smoked for about three years (mostly through vaping) and am weening off of it now. I have used marijuana in the past. 

Thank you for any insight or help given.",2,1,2020-07-23,PTSD pregnancy,377,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Finding out that I have cancer would give me less anxiety than NOT knowing what these results mean... HELP,"This is my first post ever, so try not to cringe... 

I’ll get straight to the point: I’m a 27 Y/O female and I had a transvaginal ultrasound recently. I need help deciphering the results and figuring out what may be going on. 

[Skip-able side note: I’m not entirely medically illiterate as I used to be an EMT, but this is beyond me. My anxiety is so high... I’m not exaggerating when I say that this is keeping me up every single night, just brainstorming what it may be. I’m not particularly afraid of having cancer or anything, I just can’t stop thinking about what it MIGHT be. It’s so frustrating. My next appointment is not until in December.]

History, presentation, and labs follow the ultrasound results. 

“Measurements: The uterus measures: 10.5 x 4.4 x 5.5 cm. Right ovary measures: 3.3 x 2.8 x 2.6 cm; 13 cc. Left ovary measures: 4.0 x 3.4 x 2.2 cm; 16 cc. Endometrium: 8 mm.

FINDINGS: Transabdominal findings: Transabdominal images are limited. Endovaginal findings: Uterus: The uterus is heterogeneous. There is no focal endometrial lesion. Endometrium: The endometrial stripe is heterogeneous and mildly prominent at 8 mm. There are tiny cystic foci identified within the endometrium measuring up to 3 mm maximally. Adnexa: There is no adnexal mass. Flow is seen within each ovary without secondary signs of torsion. Multiple follicles are seen within both the left and the right ovary. Clinical correlation is advised. Given the configuration, correlation with possible polycystic ovarian syndrome is recommended. Fluid: There is no free fluid.

IMPRESSION: POSSIBLE POLYCYSTIC OVARIES. PROMINENT ENDOMETRIUM WITH TINY CYSTIC FOCI. NO WORRISOME ADNEXAL MASS. OTHER FINDINGS AS ABOVE.”


My current issue, condensed: irregular menses, infertility, abdominal and pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding
Long version: SO & I have been trying to conceive since the removal of my IUD 9 months ago, my cycles came regularly for a while although they were anovulatory, until I had 8 straight weeks of heavy menstruation beginning first week of September. I explained this to my new OB-GYN in October, who ordered the ultrasound. Follow-up for endometrial biopsy was scheduled at the same time as the ultrasound, but it’s not until December. 

Relevant medical history: polycystic ovaries, endometriosis (surgically confirmed), 3 live vaginal deliveries, 1 first trimester miscarriage, hypothyroidism, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, chronic high WBC, and family history of breast, lung, and brain cancer

Relevant surgical history: right ovarian cystectomy laparotomy in 2010, post-partum retention of placenta requiring a D&C in 2014, cholecystectomy in 2014, post-partum exploratory laparotomy for diagnosis of endometriosis and abdominal adhesions in 2019

Lab results, condensed: WBC high (11.5), neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes are borderline high, calculated osmolality is low (274), FSH 5.2, LH 18, prolactin 6.8, testosterone serum 44, TSH 1.010, T3 122.3, T-4 0.9, HcG < 1, DHEA sulfate 171.0, 17-OH progesterone 96, EGFR 94

So, Dr. Google and late night anxiety has suggested endometrial hyperplasia and uterine cancer, so that’s what I’m prepared for, but obviously I’m hoping it’s not. I’m driving my SO crazy staying up all night, so he suggested I turn to Reddit. 

The only thing worse than having a period for 2 months straight and every other week since is laying in bed at night wondering what the hell a heterogeneous endometrium is and what cystic foci are... Please just give me some feedback that’s more personalized than my Google results. Thank you!",2,7,2020-11-23,late delivery,570,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Tetanus Concerns,"**Hello, doctors of Reddit!**

**Please, replies from doctors only.**

**Multiple perspective/advice is appreciated. Anything to get me headed onto the right track, I'll participate in. I tried to be as detailed as possible, but if you have any further questions, feel free to question.**

* What happened?
   * Cut finger on the door latch of my room. Not the deepest cut per se, and small. Produced beaded blood, though. 
* How did you treat it?
   * Drenched a paper napkin in alcohol and pressed it onto the wound, applying pressure for the bleeding trickling to stop. After a couple minutes, washed it and then put a new alcohol-drenched paper napkin on it with pressure. It stung that time.
   * Washed the area around it, then put an antibacterial ointment on a bandage and strapped it.
   * Kept it like that for like 10 minutes, then washed it under running water again for a minute and 30 seconds or so, then applied ointment (no bandage).
   * In the textural indents of the skin, there were tiny little veins of brown. I thought maybe it was a bruising effect, but it turns out it was drying blood. It didn’t rub off or wash off, I had to scrape it off with my finger. Made sure to not get it into the wound, and it wasn’t inside, just around the skin like a stain.
   * Wound is clean now, not bleeding even a little bit, etc.
* Concerns?
   * Have definitely gotten a tetanus shot before, but I don’t think it was anytime recent. Not in the last 5-10 years if I had to guess.
* Site of infection (body & area)
   * Upper right index finger.
   * On a stiff door latch. No dust on the latch itself, use it often, relatively clean, but around the inner edges where my skin must’ve been caught was a weird, blackish dust or something. Almost looked like soot when I swiped a finger there. Guess I'll have to carry a first aid wipe with me now to clean every surface I touch :(
* **Questions that I would like to be answered, please:**
   * Won’t be able to go to the doctor unless symptoms arise. Is it possible that, if symptoms of Tetanus arise, that I can still get treatment and recovery can be possible?
   * If this happened to you, what would you have done?
   * Anything else I should do to treat the wound or something I should look out for (symptoms besides the normal infamous lockjaw associated with this).
* Additional info:
   * I’m 19, almost 20, female, 5'3.
   * This happened at about 8:10 in the AM, about two hours ago give or take a few minutes.
   * I’m living in Asia (I’m writing this as I’m sure tetanus isn’t common in the US, where I got my tetanus shot at one point in time.)
   * No, I cannot go to the doctor immediately. Telling my parents I need to get a tetanus shot because I got a random cut would have them bringing me to a mental asylum instead 🤡.
   * Don’t have any other health condition (heart diseases, pregnancy, diabetes, etc.)…that I know of, of course.
   * **If you want, I can give you a picture of the wound + black dusty thing, if that makes it easier.**

AskDocs,Help determining date of conception,"26, female, 4 foot 10, 120lbs, Asian. I’m trying to verify the approximate date of conception of my pregnancy. I am currently about 8 months pregnant as far as I know. I had an unwanted sexual experience last September, and then had regular consensual sex with my husband in October. I found out I was pregnant in November and as far as I know the baby was conceived in October. I’m pretty sure it was, but I still get worried that something weird might have happened and caused ultrasounds or hcg levels to be off, like if my body produced hcg so slowly that it seemed like the baby was conceived in October but it was actually earlier? Is this possible?

Data points:  

* Period Sept 9-12 (sex Sept 12)  
* Possible period or spotting Oct 10 (31 day cycle)  
* Positive pregnancy test November 11  
* Quantitative HCG test Nov 12: 882.5 mIU/mL (5-6 weeks?)  
* Ultrasound Dec 20 placing me at 9w6d (expected 10+1 based on LMP)  
* Ultrasound Jan 3 placing me at 12w (expected 12+1)  
* Ultrasound Mar 4 placing me at 19w6d (expected 20+6)  
* Ultrasound Apr 16 placing me at 25w6d (expected 27w)  

A few more points:

* I have had periods ranging from 24-32 days but usually had regular periods around 28 days. I believe my LMP was Oct 10 which was a 31 day cycle from Sept 9-Oct 10. I don’t know if I remembered it correctly or if maybe it was some kind of early pregnancy spotting instead.  
* I took Plan B back in June which led to a couple very short cycles (15 and 19 days) before returning to normal length. I don’t know if that would affect my ovulation pattern.  
* I was taking Monistat before my September cycle hit and don’t know if that has any effect on ovulation timing either.  
* I have always been very petite and was less than 100lbs before pregnancy, I was born full term but physically “premature,” I don’t know if this would have any relation to a baby growing slowly.

No ultrasounds since then and I may not get another one. All the dates seems to indicate conception during October. I am told early ultrasounds are very accurate. But is there any unusual situations that could cause ultrasounds or HCG to be a month off when dating pregnancy? Does a gestational age of 10 weeks (like in my December ultrasound) always indicate conception around 8 weeks ago or is it possible to have conceived earlier than that? Or should I assume that it was definitely October?

Thank you very much in advance.",2,6,2020-06-04,gestational age,442,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,"Short limbs on ultrasound, 38 weeks pregnant","My baby has been breech since around 32 weeks, but I’ve otherwise had an uneventful pregnancy. 

I am scheduled for a c-section tomorrow at 39 weeks and had a growth scan yesterday at 38+5 to check positioning and size before delivery. This was my first ultrasound since the anatomy scan at 20 weeks. I was told after my anatomy scan that everything was looking good and on track, but given no specific measurements. 

At my growth scan yesterday, I noted when she measured baby’s femur that it was showing on screen at 33 weeks + some number of days. The humerus also seemed to be measuring around 33 weeks. Head and abdomen measuring about 40 weeks. All of these values I read off the screen as she was measuring, I wasn’t provided with this info by the tech or anything. The tech did tell me that his estimated weight is 7lb 1oz and sent me on my way. 

I (of course) googled the femurs measuring so far behind and got results such as Down’s Syndrome and various forms of dwarfism. Cue me freaking out for the next 12 hours. 

I had my follow up appointment this morning and mentioned my concerns to my doctor regarding the femur and humerus lengths, and she said that they are measuring behind (again I wasn’t given exact values/percentiles/what GA they were measuring), but didn’t give me much indication what this means either way. She did say that if this had been seen at 30 weeks, for example, she may have referred me to MFM for more scans and genetic counseling if I would’ve wanted it, but that since we’re so close to delivering, it will be easier to assess baby once he’s here. 

She did say that she looked back at my anatomy scan and his femurs were 20-30th percentile then, and asked my height and my fiancé’s height. I’m 5’4”, he’s 5’7”. She suggested he could just be a short baby (although if he’s truly off by 5 weeks, that seems more significant to me than just being short) and that scans this late aren’t always accurate and his breech positioning may have played a role in this. She didn’t comment on other possibilities such as DS or dwarfism, just said we’d see him tomorrow and look him over. 

Can anyone speak to the level of concern I should have for a chromosomal or skeletal abnormality for our baby? We declined genetic screening in the first trimester because we have no family history and are both young (24 and 25), but now I’m regretting that a little bit. In your experience, would you have concern for fetal abnormalities?",2,4,2020-12-03,c-section delivery,445,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Anxiety in the mornings.,"Hello, I'm a 22 y/o female, engaged, I don't smoke cigarettes,  I smoke Marijuana through out the day to eat and focus and feel more elevated rather than depressed sometimes. I get about 6-8 hours of sleep depending. I try to eat 1-2x a day when I can. I'm 5'4, 117 pounds, white. I take gabapentin 300mg for anxiety, 7mg of mirtazapine for depression, and Janel birth control. 

Anyway, I take trazadone 150mg  to sleep so far its the only thing that actually keeps me asleep for the whole night. I don't really dream either. When I don't take trazadone I have vivid dreams. Lately I've been sleeping early and waking up early with anxiety.  Fluttering heart, a heavy pit is in my stomach, and my breath becomes shallow or harder. It feels like I should lay down and just not move because of it. I feel it from my navel to my collarbones every morning. 

I've noticed it's more prominent when I sit up or stand rather than lay down. I'm currently laying on my side focusing on this to try and not be so anxious.  
I hate to take my gabapentin as soon as I wake up and risk being tired for a while. Because sometimes the trazadone already has me in a fog.. but I'm so anxious. 

I'm so tired of waking up anxious and sick. It takes a while for the anxiety to actually ease.. I just don't want to change my sleeping medication. I've been on it for 2-3 years now and it took so long to find something that actually made me sleep for more than 5 hours. 


Idk if any of this helps: 

I have digestive issues too. And I've been trying to understand why? I had biopsies and an endoscopy, check ups im also taking omeprazole. Sometimes if I get anxious or stressed the stomach acid gets really bad, I'm constantly burping and nauseous or feel like I may throw up. Or I actually do. Especially when im depressed or numb enough to not eat.. I'm starting to wonder how much of this is neurochemical? Or brain damage? 

I was dropped down a flight of concrete stairs and they discovered I had Coronal synostosis. They preformed the procedure to correct it and I'm not sure what damage there is now. I'm also 26 weeks premature and weighed about a pound, I spent 3 months in an incubator unable to be touched because lungs and skin were last to develop.. I know that being in a box has greatly affected me. I have a hard time with emotion, physical touch and what ever..",2,2,2020-12-04,premature birth,440,,,,,,,,,

I've never seen a gynecologist before, I've never had a pap smear, I am sexually active occasionally/rarely

I have an appointment with a gynecologist in the morning

A couple years ago I had a suspected yeast infection that turned out to be BV. They didn't do a full pelvic, just used a speculum to get a swab. I cried after. 

2 weeks ago I had the same thing. First swab went fine, doctor also felt my cervix really quickly, uneventful. Second time, last week, was a different doctor, and she did what I assume was like a minimal version of a pelvic? She did some bimanual examination. I don't really remember much. Afterwards I realized I was really really dissociated with derealization. That lasted like half an hour. Then I cried. I cried during every phone call I've had to make scheduling this.

I don't know why I'm reacting this way. I don't have any sexual trauma that I know of. I am meeting up with a close friend immediately after and not driving, and I have an appointment with my therapist in the afternoon. 

**Can anyone tell me what they'll likely do / what tests will be performed? Will I have to have a full pelvic? What will that entail? How long will it last? Will they do a transvaginal ultrasound?**

Also, will the doctor allow me to do the whole the dissociated if I warn her ahead of time and tell her I don't want her to try to bring me out of it if I seem zoned out?

AskDocs,"Chronic exhaustion, multiple illnesses in short amt of time.","I'm a 41F, married w/ 4 children. Medications include Vyvanse, Pristiq (for premenstrual dysphoric disorder) multivitamins, & magnesium.

My question requires some back story, & you'll soon see why it's relevant. 
The amount of stress I've been under in the last 10 years has been astronomical:

-getting out of poverty 
-moving every 2 years w/husband's jobs
-bed rests for multiple pregnancies (7 pregnancies in 9 yrs, 4 living children, 3.5 years *total accumulated* time spent vomiting uncontrollably, or on bed rest, during that time) 
-I've had little continuity of care, except for OB issues, because of moving across multiple counties or states. 
-All six family members have ADHD + other issues. My two youngest kids have sleep disorders. My husband has OCD & ASD. This means that, since my 3rd daughter was born, I've likely only slept in 2 hour intervals, for abt 9 years. 
-My oldest daughter has a rare combination of illnesses that I basically had to research & develop a treatment for. ADHD, OCD, SPD, ASD, & a pediatric eating disorder. She didn't eat the day she was born. She's been through 3 sessions of Maudsley Refeeding, 1 hospitalization, & finally stabilized once we got the ADHD + OCD treated properly.

This is just necessary background info incase someone says, ""You're just stressed out! Sleep! Go on vacation!"" I can't do that. The kids are 6-15 yrs old.

Since last year, I've started catching up on over a decade of missed sleep. I've slept in as long as I've needed to, since August of 2019, & my husband has done the lions share of, ""getting kids ready for school,"" so I could begin the road to recovery from all this. 
However, I've been getting ""sick,"" w/cold or flu symptoms, once or twice a month since then. There's never anything wrong---no fever, nothing on a chest X-ray, no mononucleosis, no strep---no identifiable *reason* why I should be so vulnerable as my body is FINALLY getting the sleep it needs. 
During the Pandemic, I've developed a severe migraine issue that I now take Nortryptaline, 25 MG for. I've also had more extended periods of this random ""illness"" striking---it's lasting 2-3 days, and it's every 2-4 weeks. Right now, I have it again---body aches, headaches, cough, utter exhaustion. I've been asleep for 12 hours & need MORE. 

Quite honestly, I'm angry. I want my life back. What could be causing this? How do I fix it? What does ""exhaustion"" look like, medically? And now that I've finally beaten back so many of the demons that have plagued my family, how can I do the self-care necessary so I can enjoy it?

BabyBumps,Need advice from women with similar experiences. I’ve option of c-section or vaginal delivery. Can you help me possibly weigh in on this? (Info in post),"Hi all,

TLDR: had third degree tears and shoulder dystocia first time. Am 5’4 , baby was not even huge. Have the option for a c section.

I need some outside perspective on this issue. I know each pregnancy and delivery is different and anything can happen. But I just want to few out the probability of what is better for me based on my previous experience.

I am pregnant for the second time and due date is end of May. My first pregnancy was kind of traumatic for me. I’m 5’4 and my baby was 3.4 kgs (not even in the 50th percentile). Labour was kind of painful but that wasn’t the issue. I needed, from three nurses, manual maneuvering when pushing baby out. It seemed that my pelvic area was not big enough - baby’s shoulders were stuck (shoulder dystocia). I ended up with third degree tears and after a week, abscess between vagina and anal area. That was drained after 40 days. Had mastitis and fever during that whole thing. Recovery was long and I cannot thing about it positively but now, I barely remember it. It’s now almost three years this May since my first pregnancy. This pregnancy, I noticed that whenever my husband and I had sex, my downstairs was clamp up painfully and I would need a day to feel normal again. I insisted on a generous amount of lubricant every time since then. I don’t know if it’s the hormones that are making the walls dry and more fibrous or what. I know tissue is not the same because of the the tears but I did not have this problem when we had sex before I got pregnant. So now I’m concerned how the tissue would stretch for the baby coming out if I’m having this issue with just sex. I been talking to my doctor about the possibility of having a c section for the past three, four meetings. I want to go for normal but I do not want an equivalent or a worse experience than what I had before. I also read that tears and infection after pregnancy can put you at risk for fistula which is a chronic and common issue (my doctor says that she hasn’t seen this issue in her two decades of experience but you never know...). She is being very diplomatic and not really helping in making my decision. She says that My pelvic area would be stretched out so even if this baby is big, I can push her out. She also said that because of my third degree tears, I would tear at a minimum...Pls help! I’m a little confused. I want a c section because I don’t want to end with a long recovery and double the scar and fibrous tissue down there and possibly chronic conditions. But then do need a c section? Ugh.

AskDocs,Help dealing with tramadol withdrawal please,"33F. Main issues Fibromyalgia, IBS, chronic acid reflux, chronic depression, Borderline PD. Current medication: Tramadol 50mg (dose varied, see below), Oramorph 2.5ml-5ml as needed (not every day use), Paracetamol 1000mg 4 times daily, trazodone 300mg at night, omeprazole 20mg at night, OTC vitamin D supplement one per day (prior diagnosed deficient, prescribed highed dose for a couple of months, now taking OFC dose to maintain). I also have the mirena coil.


My main situation is that I'm planning to start a family, but to do so I need to come off most of my medications - I was advised on this at the hospital at the gynae clinic as well as monitoring with my GP. So far I have come off Gabapentin entirely (was 300mg 3 times daily) and have been going down by 50mg per week with tramadol.   I was taking both for 5 years or more for the chronic pain, the rise in pain coming off them is cery difficult but I am trying to cope so I have the best chance when ready to attempt pregnancy


I'm currently in the last stages of tramadol, only on 1-2 50mg pills over the day. I was on 8 per day across 4 doses. I'm trying to go down from 2 to 1, but I'm finding the withdrawal much much worse and on the verge of unbearable.


The worst part is the feeling in the stomach, ""pangs"", or like a dull fizzing sensation on the edge of being pain which grows worse until it is unbearable and I move which makes it better for 10-30 seconds before it gets awful again. As you can imagine this is making sleep impossible. The Trazodone I take is usually highly sedating at night to help me sleep but it took well over an hour more than usual last night, and that was after I had to give in and take the 2nd tramadol for the day and 2.5ml morphine because the pain was also unbearable.


I don't want to use much morphine at all, I use the bare minimum when my pain is unbearable to cope with in other ways (heat packs, rest, etc).


I'm so close to being off the tramadol, and have coped thus far with reducing, but it is getting almost impossible to take less than this because of how horrific the withdrawal feels. It is just worse than the withdrawal I've been coping with up to this point. I'd call my GP but they're not open again til Monday. I want to keep reducing, so I can start lowering the dose of Trazodone next (which I dread as it controls my mental health very well and has done for 6+ years, but I am focused on the bigger picture of having a family). 


If there's any advice on how to reduce these symptoms,  especially the feeling in the stomach and the feeling of being utterly uncomfortable in my own skin like it doesn't fit and is full of ants, I'd super appreciate it. It is horrible, and really hard to deal with on top of chronic pain which leaves me disabled even with the full painkillers I was on.",2,1,2020-06-19,mental health during pregnancy,530,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,untreated ureaplasma infection in pregnancy,"i apologize for the long post, but i’d like to start this off by giving a little background. on march 12th, i got a message from my doctor saying i tested positive for both ureaplasma and mycoplasma. both my boyfriend and i took 250 mg azithromycin for ten days and abstained from intercourse as directed. after the antibiotics were done, we continued as we usually did. 

june 16th, i went to my doctor appointment and was told they needed to retest me for mycoplasma and ureaplasma as they forgot to do it after i finished the antibiotics. they sent the wrong tube to the lab and had to redo it on july 1st. 

july 5th, i went to the hospital when i woke up with severe back pain. i normally woke up with moderate low back pain, and i’ve had back pain for years, so when it was so severe i wanted to cry, i knew something was up. i was admitted with a kidney infection that was thankfully caught early on. they did two rounds of iv antibiotics over the course of two days, as well as iv iron for severe anemia. i was also told i have hydronephrosis. i was sent home with a prescription for 325 mg ferrous sulfate and sulfamethoxazole that i take twice a day. 

july 10th, i get a text from my pharmacy saying they’re going to call my doctor regarding a new prescription that was sent in. i checked the app, and my normal doctors office had prescribed 150 mg clindamycin hcl with the directions to take three pills three times a day for a week. the pharmacy has still not filled this prescription, and i was also in the dark as to why it was prescribed. 

which brings me to yesterday, july 13th. i got a message from my doctor saying i’m still positive for the ureaplasma infection but not the mycoplasma. it explains so much: off smelling discharge, most likely the uti that led to my kidney infection, why i was prescribed more antibiotics on top of the ones i’m already taking. 

my main concern here is what has this done to my baby? i know as a pregnant woman that infections can do things to the baby when they are left untreated. i’m not very happy with my doctors because they “forgot” to retest for the infection and let it go for 4 months untreated. i’ve read that ureaplasma can cause uti’s but it’s not the most common way. i would also like to know if my baby is born with complications due to the infection, or if i had any complications during labor, if there’s any sort of legal action i can take. 

if you read all of this, thank you. i resort to this sub more often than i’d like to, but i have a lot of concerns as this is my first pregnancy. anything helps :)",2,1,2020-07-15,early labor,489,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,I am getting coflicting opinions from my clinic. I have some questions about determining risk factors and coronavirus,"This is about my daughter and myself. 
I (38m) am a military spouse and I use tricare. I am also a disabled vet and could use the VA, but have never enrolled in the VA health care system. My daughter is 2 and only has acess to tricare. 

We were contacted by the clinic on the base to inform us that we were high risk. This made sense because I have had a previous acute myocardial infarction and currently have hypertension. We also received a  call for my daughter, but her problems are far more extensive. She was born with an AV canal defect. She was in the hospital for a long time over this. She came home trached and vent dependent. She also came home with a GJ tube. Her list of previous and current ailments include 
- Necrotizing enterocolitis developed after birth due to bloodflow problems. She was not premature. Resolved after heart repair.
- bronchiotracheo Malaysia. Resolved with age and the tracheostomy has been removed. 
- laryngeal cleft, unresolved.
- pancreatitis- resolved after lipid treatment ceased for NEC
- She also had two serious bouts of pneumonia 

Now the confusing part. My wife has been working from home during the pandemic because of our high risk status. I have reduced my hours to stay home with the kids. I work alone so my my exposure risk is minimal. Last week her commander started requiring everyone who was not high risk nor had high risk family members to come back to work. No problem, we just contacted the clinic through the secure messaging service. The strange part is that our doctor replied that neither one of us was high risk, due to being young. This is the exact same clinic that called us out of the blue to warn us we were high risk.

 My wife was forced to start coming back. She is exposed to a large number of people daily. There is also a stigma around following CDC guidelines in the military, or at least at her base. 

My three specific questions are
- Should I enroll in and then go to the VA for a second opinion? 
- Should I cough up the money for my daughter to be seen by a private practitioner? 
- Do we seem high risk to you?",2,5,2020-07-09,premature birth,387,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,Sedentarism and shortness of breath making me fear Pulmonary Embolism,"Background info: 27y, male, 175cm, 89kg, slightly overweight, no other chronic diseases that I know of (currently in investigation for possible Dysautonomia because of my constant high heart rate).


I've been extremely sedentary ever since the vírus started. I've been working from home ever since March, only going out for groceries and stuff. Just in these last 6 months, I've put on a significant amount of weight due to the sedentarism and eating a lot of junk food.

I can't get over the fear that my sedentarism and weight gain has caused a blood clot and that I could die at any moment. I have noticed that I get winded easily lately, it's not like ""omg, I can't breathe"". It feels more like a subtle air hunger, a very subtle ""suffocating"" feel whenever I do slight exertion or even at rest. My pulse ox shows my oxygen levels always between 96-98%. I've also counted my respiratory rate mostly between 12-15. Yet I can't get any piece of mind. I'm tired of feeling like I'm gonna die.

I've literally spent the last few days on a strong impulse of reading all about DVT/PE on some hopes of getting reassuring information, but it's only brought me more suffering. Every time I feel even slightly out of breath I instantly fear the worse. I'm too scared to go to the hospital because of the vírus, and my family has pretty much given up on me, basically written me off as some nutty hypochondriac, and every time I say I'm not feeling well they just say that it's my anxiety acting up, since I've gotten several cardiac exams during the last few years and nothing abnormal has shown up except for fast heart rate. 

As I type this post, I'm freaking out because my oxygen levels are at 96% instead of the usual 97-98%.

I spend pretty much the entire day sedentary, but I do get up to go to the bathroom, eat, shower, etc. I also try not to spend more than 3 hours lying down. I'll get up and stretch my legs a bit. Is that enough movement to avoid DVT's? I've read that most cases have some other underlylng causes like recent surgery, trauma, pregnancy, cancer, and long travels sitting in one position. None of those risk factors apply to me, yet I also read that just being sedentary at home could be a risk factor, and now I'm freaking out.

Would really like some insight regarding my worries. Thanks in advance!",2,4,2020-09-08,pregnancy trauma,421,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Advice please re feeding (do I buy a breast pump in preparation or wait?),"In brief, I am 24w5d with my boy and have weekly NHS appts to monitor chances of preterm birth. 

I have got loads of stuff ready for the baby already in case of this possible/likely NICU situation. I've done it all on a super tight budget, mostly second hand stuff, and am proud of that.

I am ready and happy to push the boat out on a new double electric breast pump as I want to breastfeed if I can and I want to give myself the best chance of succeeding. Black Friday would be a good time to commit.

BUT would you advise waiting? Maybe I won't be able to breastfeed anyway? Should I see how I get on in NICU with their pumps first? Maybe my babe by some incredible luck won't arrive early?

AskDocs,Is it possible to conceive after abnormal cel biopsy?,"Age: 34

Height: 5'0""

Weight: 190 lbs (working on losing weight currently)

Medications: Megestrol 40 mg, ibuprofen (prn), tylenol (prn), Omeprazole, Citirizine, Flonase

A little background:

I recently went through the medical ringer when I suddenly had a 29 day long, incredibly heavy period that would not stop no matter what.. Four months passed where I had 19 -29 day long periods that were incredibly heavy and painful while only having a short reprieve between. 

I was diagnosed with a uterine polyp, and went in for a D&C soon after that. 

After lab results came back, I was told that the polyp came back with complex, atypical hyperplasia with squamous morules.  There was no active cancer present, but precancerous cells definitely were. 

I was sent to see another doctor, and was put on Megestrol for the next three months to make sure all of the carnage is cleared out of my uterus. 

My two doctors seem to be giving me two different opinions on the matter, though.

One is telling me that I should forego trying to have children and have a hysterectomy in order to squash the chances of cancer developing. He said he's never seen a full, healthy pregnancy come from a person who came back with complex cells before. 

The other doctor seems confident that I can conceive (albeit probably with the help of a fertility specialist and medications), and carry a baby full term. 

I wanted to get some other opinions on the matter and see if there is a chance that I could conceive and carry a healthy baby to birth, or is it not worth the risk?

Anyone's input is welcome. Thank you in advance!",2,1,2020-08-31,full term birth,281,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,"Bumpers, how are you dealing with the holidays?","With the ongoing pandemic, how have your holiday plans changed and how are you dealing with that? 

There have been studies showing that covid during pregnancy leads to increase risk of death, premature birth, miscarriage, and the list goes on. After reading about this, my SO and I (currently 25w0d) decided to be a lot more vigilant on leaving the house (only for groceries and pick up when possible) and who we saw (only other people who didnt go out). However, this means I don't get to see most of my family since they work jobs where they have to interact with people. For Thanksgiving, I didn't get to see my family and that was fine, but with Christmas coming up it is getting hard for me to stick with our plan of not interacting with our loved ones because I really miss them. It also doesn't help that people don't seem to understand or think it's a big deal.

PregnancyUK,F(25) first pregnancy - nervous as all hell!,"Hey lovelies. 

I recently discovered that I am expecting my first baby, although because I don't have periods I have no idea how far along I am.

I took a clear blue test which indicated conception to be 2-3 weeks ago, but I've already got swollen breasts, a visible bump and I'm urinating all the time. Also I'm slightly constipated 🥴 

When I called my doctor's surgery (University Doctors surgery) to make them aware of the pregnancy the receptionist said I would have a phonecall appointment on the 23rd of September (not an ultrasound). Is this normal? If I am already tender and showing I could be over 12 weeks by the time I have that phonecall...

Furthermore, I told the receptionist that I'd been experiencing sharp stabbing pains in my lower right side over the previous month. She didn't ask me anymore about the pains and just said if they got worse I should go to the walk-in centre.

Adding to all this: my doctor's surgery doesn't *deal* with pregnancies because they are a university surgery. This means I have to attend a sister centre somewhere else in the city and I have no midwife or doctor set up. 

The last 2 nights I've woken up in the night gasping for breath and panicking. I'm *hoping* (for lack of a better word) that this is a combination of stress and anxiety and exhaustion from working. But I'm also terrified it might be something else to worry about. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? I'm so nervous about this whole pregnancy and I feel really lost at not having a straightforward set up with the doctor like I had assumed.",2,9,2020-08-31,pregnancy stress,281,,,,,,,,,

Everything I read mentions that the late first trimester is one of the most important for determining FAS facial abnormalities, and that I engaged in “binge drinking.” I also read  conflicting information about how FAS is more of a concern for pregnant woman who drink heavily throughout the pregnancy. My OB knows that I drank during the first trimester, and has essentially told me that the best thing I did was stop as soon as I found out, but I’m still an absolute wreck. I already love this baby deeply, but the thought that I could have harmed him, along with the fear of judgement should he be born with distinctive facial features of FAS has me absolutely wrecked. I know much of what I may get here will be general information, but I just need something to keep me from absolutely falling apart.

Child was born via C Section after two extended heart rate drops into the 70s for roughly 5-7 minutes while awaiting vaginal birth at scheduled hospital visit.

The rest of the pregnancy was unremarkable. Heart rate was always normal and we were not told of any issues at any of our appointments. There was a cold the mother had in February that lasted about a week in which she had moderate congestion and a mild cough. The babies growth is asymmetrical, despite being small her body looks proportional. Eyes aren't huge, or oddly spaced, nose, lips and chin look normal. The head doesn't appear to be peculiarly shaped. All of her labs are normal, heart screen, blood work, hearing screen. She does have slight jaundice which appears to have already cleared or in the process of clearing. Yellow BMs have passed as well as the yellowish tint to her skin. She is being breast fed exclusively and is being fed roughly every two to three hours. Doctors, nurses, etc at the hospital didn't mention any problems. The doctor said she couldn't be any more healthy.

Because of the small HC. We are curious as to if we should be expecting mental or physical developmental problems? Mother does have a smaller head, but nothing you would notice looking at her, and was born with a AGA HC. Father has a slightly larger head, but again was born with a AGA HC.

AskDocs,6 month old with anisocoria,"Hi there! Hoping for some help in making a decision regarding my infant daughter who has been diagnosed with anisocoria. It was noticed by her pediatrician during her six month vaccines, and we were referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist. The doc confirmed the pupil sizes are different; the right one is smaller. She noted that either she was born with it, or it could be Horner’s syndrome. Of course the worry with Horner’s is that it could be a tumor causing the pressure on the eye. We reviewed previous pictures of her, and noted we could see the difference in her pupil size from at least one month old onward. There are no other noticeable symptoms of Horner’s syndrome at this time. 

The doctor has presented two choices to us - either wait and watch, or conduct a test to rule out Horner’s. The test would be using  an eye drop called Apraclonidine, which is not indicated for children. The concern is that it can cause excessive sleepiness, slow breathing and even cause infants to stop breathing. We are obviously concerned about her undergoing the test, but we also don’t want to be worrying about a potential tumor. Looking for advice on the best course of action.

I have been experiencing periodic difficulties in urination during the night with last night being the worst ... spent an hour and half in the bathroom trying to release urine with not even a drop .. strained,  tried different positions,  took a bath , nothing would work until finally I strained one more time and it finally gave way. During this time i was experiencing quite alot of pain from a full bladder. 

Today while in the shower I felt more heaviness in my vaginal area then usual,  preceeded to check with my hand and felt a buldge then felt the (closed) opening of my cervix right at the opening of my vagina.  

My questions are ;  how long is too long to have a full bladder that is unable to be emptied? Due to my pelvic floor difficulties the next time this happens should I avoid straining at all and go straight to emergency?   Will my cervix being at the opening put me on dreaded bed rest?

AskDocs,What type of Doctor should I go see?,"Hello everyone, 

for the past 2 months or so I have been experiencing a few things in relation to my jaw which I suspect has to do with my wisdom teeth(Im male, 19). very occasionally my wisdom teeth have been painful only when i push my tongue down on them. What is more worrisome is that I think my TMJ joint on the left side of my jaw ""locks up"". Its almost like theres friction between my jaw bone and my skull which prevents my jaw from fully extending/opening. My uneducated guess is that my growing jaw and wisdom teeth are creating tension on my jaw bone somehow. 

&#x200B;

Ive also experienced muffled hearing in both ears today which prompted me to write this post. I dont know if the muffled hearing is related to my jaw and/or wisdom teeth problem but ive heard of many instances where wisdom teeth that are long overdue to be removed can cause infections that sometimes are in the ear cavities.

&#x200B;

Should I just see a dentist for something like this? or is there a more specific type of doctor I should see? hopefully I explained enough to answer my question.

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance!",2,3,2020-08-30,overdue,203,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Pediatric aphasia,"This is about my 7 year old son. (White, a little over 50th percentile for height, BMI around 50th percentile; 37 weeks gestation, no known anoxic injuries at birth, has met milestones on time). He has had PE tubes places three times, and is slightly far sighted. 


He had a non-fatal drowning about a year ago, he did not need to be resuscitated. No significant head injuries. Otherwise completely unremarkable history. Brother has hypotonic CP.  Family history of Lewy Body dementia and Parkinson’s. 


As long has he has been able to talk, my son has had difficulty with word retrieval. He used circumlocution from a very early age. I thought it was cute, I’ve never heard a 3-year-old describe a banana for 5 minutes because they can’t remember the word “banana.”  He would describe what you do with it, where we keep it in the house, and where to find it in the grocery store.  When he can’t remember “ball,” it’s “the thing the Red Sox throw.”


We just started online school and part of online school in first grade to demonstrate understanding is sorting pictures or putting them in order and then recording yourself explaining. The problem is, he can’t name the pictures.  When that happened I called my pediatrician and he send me SLP resources to help address aphasia. 


My question is: what causes aphasia?  Should we see a neurologist for formal testing?  WebMD says it’s definitely a brain tumor (actually, brain tumor has come up with alarming frequency), but this has been an issue as long as I can remember and it doesn’t seem to be changing.",2,1,2020-10-07,gestational age,270,,,,,,,,,

However I have noticed since I’m been approaching my due date and dealing with random bouts of Braxton-Hicks & other practice contractions, My sense of taste and smell have been... Elevated? The last 2 weeks I’ve noticed my sense of smell is heightened somewhat worse than what I experienced when I was roughly 2 months, More particularly certain candles or other odd-ball smells I never minded before are now suddenly driving me crazy AGAIN. My sense of taste is also going a bit awry as well, Certain foods taste off or too potent. Some things that I’d normally eat (And have eaten) throughout my pregnancy are also suddenly starting to taste gross to me. More particularly - Salt seems to be a bit stronger, While certain fruits seem to be too over powering. Strawberries in particular (In all forms) Are really grossing me out as of late, And I’ve eaten them this entire time! Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this?

She's saying she sometimes have problem speech delivery, with her mouth cant say her train of thought mid sentence and has to stop and pause, slow down, then try to resay it. As for her arm she says her right arm is not as responsive or strong as it use to be, like her handwriting is very off than before and has to exert/try harder to write. Also says arm sometimes loses strength when doing tasks like in the kitchen.

She also had an appt in June for joint/pain specialist that diagnosis her with the knee arthritis and the DO did some steroid injection to the knee, could this be a sequela from the medication/treatment?

I worry she might have some serious underlying condition like early onset dementia or have serious risk of stroke, just worry its something very major and not caught early enough in time.

What should we do? should we see a specialist or run some sorts of test? Any Medical Advice would be great

Duration of complaint - since June

Any existing relevant medical issues (if any) - osteoarthritis knee, mild back pain

PregnancyUK,SMP and second job?,"I have two jobs - a full time job, and a job I do one day a week writing for a website. The one-day-a-week job will not pay me enough to qualify for statutory maternity pay (SMP).

I'm planning to take the full year off my main job and maybe 2 months off the one-day-a-week job - but I don't want to waive my rights to SMP.

Does anyone know if I can pick up the second job after the birth without losing the SMP for my main job? It's one day a week, can be done in dribs and drabs and is in the career I actually want to be in, so I'm keen to take it up again as soon as I can after the birth- I'm thinking of taking maybe two months off. The extra bit of cash is also much needed as we're going to struggle once I stop receiving anything from my full time job.

I've found a couple of websites which say that as long as you are working for both companies 15 weeks **before** the birth (which I will be), and as long as you're not claiming SMP from both (which I won't  be), then you should be fine - but there's always a lot of jargon and qualifying/disqualifying information, and I really really don't want to make a mistake.",2,7,2020-12-07,full term birth,227,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,I'm not crazy!,"Hi! I'm 37F, light smoker (as of 6 months ago) in Australia. In December 2018, my daughter was born and since she was about 2 months old, I have been in pain to varying degrees. During my pregnancy I put on 35kg and have lost 6 of that but losing weight has been incredibly difficult because I'm severely limited by my pain. My daughter's birth was uncomplicated and I have suffered no injuries, traumas, car accidents in the last 20 months with the exception of a nasty Red Back spider bite in January 2019. 

It's probably important to note that it is nerve pain,  definitely not muscular, and it moves around my body constantly. Most mornings, I am unable to make a fist and I can't walk properly because my feet hurt which gives way to a burning sensation which comes and goes throughout the day. I get sudden stabbing pains in the back of my head which disappear as fast as they come on. Some days, my middle and ring finger on my right hand will be totally immobilised because of the pain which will shoot up my forearm to my elbow. Some days I can barely lift my coffee cup. Some days it's sciatica and my legs are too weak to carry me up and down the stairs and on other days it's in my lower back. The pain is everywhere and nowhere and I never know where it will be on any given day.

Most days, my pain rates at about a 3 or 4 but some days it will get to a 7 or 8. Those are the days I've had to take time off work and they are increasing.

I've been to four doctors who've all told me there's nothing wrong with me. I've had blood tests (negative for thyroid issues and arthritis) x-rays (showed straightening of my neck which I've had for years) and an MRI on my lumbar spine which came back clean. 

One dr gave me Naprosyn (doesn't work) one gave me Lyrica (made me depressed) and one tells me that paracetamol and ibuprofen should be enough (they aren't). I'm currently not taking anything.

Other symptoms which I'm noticing include: involuntary slurring speech, inability to remember words, comprehension problems (I've always been excellent with spelling and grammar), feeling dizzy when driving at night, tinnitus, fatigue, zero libido (not even some, just none), hair loss and an inability to feel full when I eat.

I'm not crazy, I'm in pain. I don't want meds, I want an answer. I can't live like this - I am miserable. Up until 6 weeks ago I was drinking quite heavily to numb the pain enough to sleep but since I've given up drinking it's only increased the pain. What is this? What could it be?

I asked my mom/ family if i snore and they all say I don’t, that at most it’s heavy breathing (maybe it’s to protect my feelings). When I went to college my freshman roommate made my life miserable because of my snoring, i started sleeping under the bed and waiting for everyone to sleep before i slept and tried waking up early before everyone else. it got to the point i couldn’t take it anymore so i downloaded apps that help tract snoring, the recordings sounded more like labored breathing than the typical snore, but the typical snore happened occasionally too but not often. It also occurred in spirts, like a cycle. Also when I was younger my doctor said i had large tonsils not sure of that matters but my mom says it’s a possible factor.

I’ve tried different things to help reduce snoring, like nose strips and a humidifier but nothing seems to work. I was wondering what could cause my snoring and if there’s any other remedies i could try that would help reduce snoring?",1,3,2020-08-05,early labor,211,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,What’s wrong with me!? Mental health and gynaecological issues.,"
I am a F, 28, 58kg, 175cm, on no meds but take some supplements (vitamin d, magnesium, charcoal, cranberry, vitamin c, collagen, ashwagandha) Currently in a long distant relationship with a man, not using condoms as I am allergic. I have no children but I would like them in the future. I don’t want to get pregnancy right now as it’s not convenient (about to start my masters) so would like to go on birth control. I do have some issues that I am worried about it being made worse or in general. 

Gynaecological issues:

My menstruation varies month to month; some months I have painful cramps and little bleeding, other months I have heavier bleeding and little cramping, other months I have extremely painful cramps, fever, shivers, nausea, can’t get out of bed and heavier bleeding. PMS varies month to month also. I have had my hormones checked and have had multiple ultrasounds done. In the past my ovaries have been described as “polycystic looking” and the more recently the ultrasound technician said she thinks I could possibly have endometriosis, but if I do the growth is very mild as it’s not showing up on the ultrasound. 

My vaginal pH is unbalanced really easily. My boyfriend can’t come inside me because I will get BV. I get recurrent thrush infections which I treat with boric acid or clotrimazole if they get really bad. I also feel like my pelvic floor is very weak as my boyfriend can’t feel me when I kegel on him. (I’ve just started doing kegels to combat this) 

On top of this, I feel as if my vagina is quite dry and I have trouble orgasming. Sex can be painful as lubrication can be an issue (posterior fourchette sometimes has little tears) and my cervix stays very low (not sure why this is happening as never used to be a problem in the past, could be due to recent anxiety around sex? Sometimes even my mouth gets dry during sex). 

Mental health issues:

I am worried about my mental health being affected. I have bad anxiety and depression. Both are (sort of) stable for the first time in years and I don’t want to go into another deep psychotic depression and not be able to come out of it. As I’m currently unemployed due to corona and am living at home with people that I have very little daily contact with. 

I would like to go on the pill as I do not want to get pregnant right now and I was thinking that these issues could be hormonal and that going in birth control would help but at the same time I am worried about going on it if my mental health becoming unstable or exacerbating my gynaecological issues if I go on birth control. 

This is causing me so much stress. I don’t even know why my boyfriend is choosing to stay with me through all of this. I feel like such a burden! I would really appreciate any advice.",1,3,2020-09-10,stress during pregnancy,507,,,,,,,,,

I'm terrified of going through labor without my husband if hospitals lock down again during this spike.

Is it reasonable to ask to be induced sooner? Assuming this isn't a risky request, any advice on how to bring this up with my doctor? Or, are there other things we could do to help ourselves out--ex-would it make a difference if my husband and I started getting regular COVID tests?

We live in Maryland, and the cases have been relatively manageable at a state level, but they're on the rise again. We've hardly left the house since March apart from doctor visits, and outdoor visits to grandparents after checking with his doctors.  


His specialists consider him high risk, but would an adult vaccine for COVID be safe for high risk children to take? I know Pfizer is researching the affects on children now, and Moderna is beginning soon, but would high risk children be included with high risk adults?",1,2,2020-12-04,premature birth,136,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Back issues 8m. Crack today and half my body is partially numb,"28 female. 5' 3"" ~110 lbs. Depression, cPTSD (unrelated to this.) Zoloft. This might be a long shot but I am not sure what to do. I just really hope someone can help me.
I had my daughter 8 months ago, it was a traumatic birth. She was very large and got stuck. 
I started out with a whole bunch of medical problems that I was discharged from the hospital with and then I had to return to the ER to get treated for sepsis, severe anemia from hemorrhaging, pneumonia, and secondary heart failure. 
I lost feeling in my right ring finger after the birth. I had shortness of breath and back pain, I couldn't walk right due to pain in my lower back, groin and legs. The numbness in my ring finger gradually spread to three fingers on my right hand. I frequently catch my nails on things and break them but it doesn't hurt as much as it should. 
The front of my pelvis was opened and I had soft tissue damage which has healed up and I can walk mostly now without pain except in my tailbone. 
My tailbone sticks out now and feels crooked. I can't seem to get a doctor to look at it or take it seriously. 
I also have a rib that hurts when I move, touch it, breathe or do anything really but I've just adjusted to living with it until today when it got worse. I've gone to the doctor numerous times to no avail. 
Today, I asked my fiance to rub my back and he put gentle pressure on the opposite side of the bad rib and I felt a pop and then I had severe pain, I took more medication and laid down. As I laid down the numbness started setting in in my feet and when I woke up from my nap it went from my right foot all the way up my neck. 
I went to the ER and they were dismissive and told me it's a repetitive strain injury. They wouldn't even acknowledge the numbness on half my body because I'm young (28) and my vitals were good aside from increased heart rate. The doctor waved his arms around and said ""it's some kind of a mechanical thing.""
The pain in my rib is excruciating now. As always it wraps from the back all the way to the front. Half my back is swollen and the muscles are sticking out well past the other side. My coccyx keeps snapping, clicking and paining. My neck is stiff and I feel pressure in my head. 
The numbness isn't really bad but its noticable, when I pinch my skin on my right side it feels less sharp than my left. A tack feels more like pressure than a point until firm pressure is applied.
Can anyone give me any advice or a direction of where to go? I am desperate and willing try anything at this point. Can a chiropractor help me?
I do light stretching and exercising, I breastfeed my daughter so all I can take is tylenol and ibuprofen which may as well be placebos at this point. 
My fiance is returning to work next week (hes been off since I was in the hospital.) I have 5 kids in total, 2 of my own and 3 bonus. My only other pregnancy was perfectly fine and I had no issues at all.",1,1,2020-06-16,PTSD pregnancy,575,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,"Severe pain in pelvis but first dr said ""it's fine""??","This first happened in march. I'd wake up in the early am in incredible lower pelvic pain, near-constant (not the rolling waves of cramps). For about a week this persisted, and I'd have to down iburpofen at 6am and lay curled up until it kicked in. Wennt to gyno, they did an exam and tests. No STD/yeast/bacteria. All good. No UTI. I asked for antibiotics anyways because I had a terrible UTI a few months prior (first one ever) and as a kid I had ""stealth UTIs"" and one got into my kidneys and I nearly died. Dr. did not believe it was anything, but I kept fighting her that this is not normal for me. She then suggested that it could be a cyst, but they don't like to do anything about them and I *could* get an ultrasound but at a different office 30 minutes away. At the time, the pandemic shutdown was in full force so it was hard to get in anywhere, and I didn't have a car. So I didn't pursue it further.

It went away after the antibiotics and Advil. Never thought of it again, until yesterday.

I woke up at 4am yesterday with the same incredible pain in my very low pelvis/pubic region. Took ibuprofen and water and laid there in pain until they kicked in - I can actually feel the moment they kick in because it's like the pain whooshes away. Went back to sleep, thought maybe it's an ovulation thing? Slight ache in left ovary during day, nothing else. Went to bed last night tossing and turning, feeling super hot an uncomfortable. Woke up at 7 in EXTREME pain, went pee (no burning or difficulty) and then took some Tylenol and one ibuprofen (since I hadn't eaten I wanted to be careful). I was writhing around in bed, it was so bad. It's like I'd imagine early labor, but without the relief of the gap between contractions. No position didn't hurt, I was exhausted but also wanting to vomit from the pain. \~20 later the meds kicked in and I was able to get back to sleep and feel comfortable, and now at 3pm it's still all good (just a dull sense of discomfort and bloating). I'm very fatigued, though, and almost feel like I have a cold physically (tested negative for covid last week).

What. the. fuck?

During my actual ""period"" I have very little cramping, and it only lasts around 4 days and is very light.

I plan on getting an app ASAP for this and having them do a more thorough check. Could it be a cyst rupturing? Last pain was on my right ovary, this time it's the left. Could it be ovulation pain?I've been on birth control for 9 years, 2 of which have been with Nexplanon (so no estrogen). Period is every \~50 days. My boobs have been SUPER painful to touch the last week as well. No diet changes, no sex (thnx covid) in like 10 months, since way before my last doctor visit.

TLDR; 23 yr old female, not sexually active this year, on birth control; random sporadic *severe* pain in lower pubic region in early mornings (1 week in march, and now in September). Cyst? Ovulation? Uterus trying to rip itself out to leave the US?

AskDocs,"Would you, as a doctor, ever recommend a woman continue smoking during her pregnancy for any reason?","I'm neither pregnant nor a smoker but a debate got going amongst a group I'm part of. Many people claimed their doctor advised they simply cut back smoking claiming that the stress of quitting smoking would be more harmful to their baby. I couldn't find any evidence to back that statement up and it sounds like rubbish. So I thought I'd ask reddit's doctors what they thought of that statement. Someone even claimed 5 or 5 cigarettes is completely safe for a pregnant woman and won't cause her baby any harm. I find that hard to believe.

**Please tell me flat out if I am simply being paranoid, delusional, manic or hyperactive after seeing my labs and reading my issue so I can lay it to rest**

In short, I've been seeing the same GP since I was 6 years old. I was adopted and raised in Canada from Bulgaria. Despite many trips to the hospital for Bloodwork, Fainting, Low-Vision, and Sleep-Trouble (among others), my GP has assured my family that ""everything came back normal"" and insisted no specialist (endochrinologist etc) was needed and that her prescriptions are all I need. 
I've been getting gradually worse, and have decided to take my medical records for a review, and seek a second opinion from another doctor. Am I jumping the gun and being too harsh on my GP by abandoning her? Are my labs ""perfect"" and ""it's all in my head?""
**Am I just ""*complaining too much?*""**
I've added a few of the labs that were highlighted on my (large) file, and I would very much appreciate any insight as to whether the readings are indeed within the ""normal, fine"" range - or if I am just being a hypochondriac. 

Much appreciated!

My apologies if my post is so long, but this really is as brief but detailed I could make my medical history. I have attached a couple of the labs that I believe warrant a review as they may not be *""normal""*. Or, their could be an explanation for my symptoms within the normal variables - in which case, I don't want to jump the gun and leave my doctor.

Either way, I feel like I am 65 when I should be at the time of my life. I don't understand the purpose of so many tests if they are all returned ""normal"" and my GP says to keep my med regimen simply. When I complain, I sometimes get accused of being ""moody"" or ""manic"" or not taking my medication.

AskDocs,Should we be worried about my fiancées lactating when she is NOT pregnant?,"23F 5’6” 150lb 

Really quick info: she’s been pregnant twice but neither made it full-term. She’s has a birth control implant in her arm. She just had her period. She’s taken many pregnancy tests over the past week. It’s not much, just a few small drops/specs. It used to be just a spec or so every few days if she really squeezed (months-years ago). Recently it’s gotten more, now the drops are larger and produced through out the day. Her nipples/boobs have been sore the past two weeks or so. I have felt for lumps many times and haven’t felt anything.

Should we be worried or is this normal? We’ve been milking her past few days and she’s getting temporary relief but I feel like too much is going to hurt her nipples and breasts more than help.",1,1,2020-07-14,full term birth,138,,,,,,,,,

Firstly, i do wear glasses, and I’m overdue to get new ones. Current frames are 2 years old.I noticed the spot immediately after taking a shower. I don’t believe it was there prior. The shower was on the warmer side, but I certainly wouldn’t say it was hot.

It’s located on the bridge of my nose, right between my eyes and it’s around half an inch in size.

I can’t recall exactly what I did prior to the first instance, but it is about in the same spot and the same size as the bruise on my face now.

AskDocs,US specific hypothetical about standard of care in case of pPROM,"F


180 lbs


5’10”


Pregnant 13 weeks


SCH < 2 cm since 6 weeks. Active bleed


I am concerned about the risks associated with an SCH. 

I have two acquaintances who have a SCH and both experienced pPROM at 23 weeks. Both are hospitalized indefinitely hoping to stay pregnant as long as possible.

For obvious reasons I am concerned this will also happen to me.

The thing is, I don’t want to go to the hospital for weeks. If my water breaks very early, it seems I should let go of hope for the life I’m carrying. 

Is this something that I may have a choice about? Or will they force me to be hospitalized? 

I have a daughter and my husband works. No one could watch her if I am stuck in the hospital. Plus a really early delivery could mean profound disabilities for the child.

Do I have any options if I experience pPROM?

-	Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC).
-	Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), probably exasperated by the disseminated intravascular coagulation.
-	A colostomy, had a stoma bag for 6 months until the DIC and NEC got better and my colon could be anastomosed. Good thing I don't remember any of it.

I'm completely blind in my left eye and have 20/100 vision in my right eye. The left eye has a cataract and calcium build up but it's been stable for years and my pediatric ophthalmologist thinks there's no point in risking things and doing surgery to remove it if I can't see out of the eye anyway.

Is it reasonable to ask to be induced sooner? Assuming this isn't a risky request, any advice on how to bring this up with my doctor? Or, are there other things we could do to help ourselves out--ex-would it make a difference if my husband and I started getting regular COVID tests?

My family would like to go on a road trip from California to Wisconsin (31 hours, 2000 miles). The trip is planned to be divided into two days driving about 15 hours each day. At the time of the trip our L.o. Will be 16-weeks-old and was born without any other problems other than being premature. I’ve been seeing a “2 hour rule” that recommends limiting a babies time in a car seat for breathing and spine development concerns. Mom will ride in the backseat to monitor l.o.’s head position and breathing. We don’t normally need to drive and in general her time in a car seat is very limited. Not sure if the “2hour rule” is referring to more consistent or daily use. We’ve thought about taking a plane or train instead but worry about her immune system in those situations. 

Is this considered a safe plan? If so are there any special precautions we should take?

About half an hour into my shift, I've noticed I've started to feel mt legs less and less, yet I'm still walking, but slowly to be cautious. This immediately effects my performance and cause me to walk slower. Another half an hour goes by and I begin feeling a minor headache along with the slowly weakening, however it isnt severe. I take a 15 minute break to grab a honey bun and some water because I thought I just needed sugar tk wake me up. Afterwards, I give it another half an hour, and now I'm depending on a shopping cart to keep me standing and taking deep breaths to make sure I don't drop right there on the floor. I drink more cold water for 15 minutes and realize it's not getting any better, so I called my Assistant Manager and let him know I had to leave early. I get a ride from my grandfather and get home and sit in my room for a little longer until I can get up and at least shower and wipe down the surfaces in the bathroom. I do that, and just put on my underwear and fall asleep with the dehumidifier on so I could cool down. I wake up 3 hours later sweating anyways and I go through the next couple days with this headache. I start to feel better 2 days later, but I took the second day off to prevent having to call sick from over-exerting myself too soon.

Yesterday, I return to work and make it through the shift just fine, except I've had to stop a couple times more than usual to drink water. Since 2 days ago, I have noticed that with physical labor, I end up feeling my heart beating way harder than usual. This continues in waves throughout the day. I've even woken up this morning drenching the bed and the sheets in sweat because of my heartbeat. I feel like maybe part of the problem might be anxiety, especially since I no longer smoke, even though I haven't thought about relapsing at all this week.

I should also mention that along with the rough and fast heart rate (I never measured it but felt it change so much), I've been exhausted to the point I almost feel like I'm a little Intoxicated, which has never happened for more than 2 hours in a day until this week. As I am typing this my brain is starting to ache a little. Can anyone tell me if these harsh heartbeats are considered Heart Palpitations, if not anything else? Any help would be greatly appreciated",1,1,2020-06-12,early labor,538,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Premature CAD risk?,"I am 24F, I have been diagnosed with Crohn's disease and am on a corticosteroid and pantoprazole for it at the moment.

My question is that my Grandfather (my moms dad)  died at 45 due to back to back heart attacks from smoking 2-3 packs a day, and my mom who had MS and died of a heart attack caused by DVT at 57. I know these two ages are particularly young for heart disease and I'm unsure if that even though their's were caused by  either being bed ridden for years (my mom) or smoking an extreme amount (my grandfather) if I should be worried about premature coronary artery disease or heart disease in general at my young age?

AskDocs,Road trips and my premature baby,"Facts: female, 8-week- old, born 6 weeks premature, now 10 lbs, 21 inches

My family would like to go on a road trip from California to Wisconsin (31 hours, 2000 miles). The trip is planned to be divided into two days driving about 15 hours each day. At the time of the trip our L.o. Will be 16-weeks-old and was born without any other problems other than being premature. I’ve been seeing a “2 hour rule” that recommends limiting a babies time in a car seat for breathing and spine development concerns. Mom will ride in the backseat to monitor l.o.’s head position and breathing. We don’t normally need to drive and in general her time in a car seat is very limited. Not sure if the “2hour rule” is referring to more consistent or daily use. We’ve thought about taking a plane or train instead but worry about her immune system in those situations. 

Is this considered a safe plan? If so are there any special precautions we should take?

AskDocs,Question about pre mature birth.,"M 21 6 foot 160 lbs.

I was born on time, but my mothers birth was induced when sleeping in bed with my sister and dad 21 years ago when my sister (kicks in her sleep) kicked my mom in the back or stomach which soon after brought me into the world.

Im wondering if that same kick would of brought my mom into labor if it was 3 months earlier in the pregnancy. 

In other words, was the kick able to induce labor because my mom was at full term in the pregnancy? And would that same kick not induce labor if she wasnt as far along in the pregnancy?

I know this is a little different for this sub, but i dont know where else to ask.

BabyBumps,How was your second birth experience compared to the first one?,"I’m (F28) 7 weeks into my second pregnancy and I am absolutely mortified with the idea of giving birth again.

My first pregnancy was unplanned, I spent those 9 months with crippling anxiety. Although my birth was easy and fast, I have not been able to shake off the trauma it caused me. I think I have PTSD, I can’t even think about the experience without becoming light headed and passing out. I’m a big time WUSS, so please don’t compare yourself to me. 

I had an induction (HATED IT, lost control of my contractions), and also an epidural (getting the epidural was traumatic, I felt a spine cracking sensation, It was so uncomfortable). I labored for 4 hours and pushed my son out in 10 minutes. Never again I said. 

Except it’s been 19 months since my son was born and I am now pregnant again (unplanned). It’s taken me 3 weeks to cope, I can finally say im excited. But I cannot shake the absolute fear of giving birth. I can’t even think about it without going into a panic attack. It is consuming me, I genuinely believed I would never become a mother in my lifetime and have to experience childbirth yet here I am. 

How was your second birth compared to the first? I want to prepare myself for the best or worst possible outcome.",1,16,2020-11-07,PTSD pregnancy,229,,,,,,,,,

Here’s the timeline of illness:

Friday night: heartburn/acid reflux when lying down which turned into me throwing up everything I ate that day. Assumed I ate something bad. I’ve had acid reflux this whole pregnancy so nothing new. 

Saturday: still felt a little weird from last night but felt better over the course of the day. Then felt nauseous again come nighttime. Again as soon as I go to bed I start regurgitating then vomiting everything. 

Sunday: wake up feeling uninterested in food but not nauseous. Lots of burping/reflux stuff. Start having watery diarrhea that subsides in the afternoon but then returns at night. Didn’t throw up that night. 

Monday: generally feeling shitty but no nausea. Lots of burping. Still diarrhea but it comes and goes. 

Tuesday: feel totally fine. Normal appetite, no diarrhea. Back to my old self. 

I have no idea what this was and I’m worried it could have been dangerous or contagious to my husband or baby. I never even ran a low grade fever, so my doctor suggested it was a sensitivity to my iron supplements, which I stopped taking on Sunday. Recovery happened really suddenly. I’m very worried it could have been covid,  but my husband is in the house 24/7 and the last time I left the house was to see my OB, where I wore full PPE including goggles and N95. That was 10-11 days before I started feeling sick. My doctor doesn’t think it was covid. My parents think it was just “weird pregnancy stuff.” Meanwhile I’m terrified my husband is about to fall sick.

AskDocs,Unexplained hypoglycemia in postpartum Leiden factor V female,"A family member (35 yo F) has been having issues with unexplained hypoglycemia.  Currently 4 months postpartum.  During pregnancy was diagnosed as gestational diabetic (the most compliant diabetic you've ever seen).  She threw a nasty superior messenteric venous thrombus almost immediately after delivery which was fun and led us to the heterozygous Leiden diagnosis. She is back to her pre pregnancy weight (or darn close) at 125 lbs.

About a month ago she starts having bouts of hypoglycemia that occur late morning or early afternoon and happen almost every day.  We tried dietary changes with no results.  Contacted her ob who got her a 2 hour glucose tolerance test.  First hour was fine, second hour results: 22 followed with slurred speech and a small car accident.

We've been working for a month to get her into an endocrinologist but it's going to be at least another month so i figured I'd ask here for ideas on what this could possibly be.  Primary care is useless as he tried to start her on metformin which is contraindicated with Coumadin.

Last thing to add, I've never seen any of her finger sticks showing hyperglycemia and she's on Coumadin for the clotting disorder.  Also had two family members die of pancreatic cancer 2 generations ago (this is what I'm really scared about)

AskDocs,Requesting C-section under general anesthesia,"Hi everyone! Hoping to get some much needed insight...

I am a 29 year old female in Toronto, Canada with the condition Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH).  I suffer from debilitating headaches and I've got papillidema from the increased pressure. I've had multiple lumbar punctures in the past-  all leading to CSF leaks, low pressure headaches and blood patches. Needless to say I am very apprehensive to have anything go near my spinal cord due to the physical and emotional trauma caused.

I have been avoiding the idea of pregnancy for a long time as I know that it could potentially increase my symptoms and lead to further damage to my optic nerves and thus vision loss. Most of my symptoms are currently made worse by hormonal changes around my period so I'm worried about how pregnancy hormones will affect my pregnancy. 

With all this said, I am getting to the point where I desperately want to have a child with my partner and it is a life change that is very imminent. My concerns now mainly lie with the actual delivery process.

My main question is: given my health condition, am I allowed to request a cesarean section under general anesthesia? I absolutely do not feel comfortable with an epidural or spinal block and absolutely do not feel comfortable with a vaginal delivery as CSF pressure raises with pushing. 

I am terrified and apprehensive to get pregnant unless I know that my preferred method of delivery/anesthesia will be honored. I don't want to put myself more at risk.

I hope I can get some insightful answers! Thank you in advance :)",1,3,2020-08-17,c-section delivery,271,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Melatonin causing neurological issues after 10 consecutive nights of use?,"Gender: Female 
Age:25 
Height: 1.76m
Pre-existing conditions: depression, anxiety. 

Hi I was prescribed 5mg Melatonin to take ""as needed"" before bed, and after night 1 of taking it, I experienced extreme daytime sleepiness and felt very groggy. I continued to take the Melatonin every night, since I'm in the final stages of submitting my PhD and I generally struggle to sleep. After about 7 nights of taking it, I started feeling extra depressed, groggy and started explaining to people that I have ""flu brain"" or ""foggy brain"", attributing my issues speaking, reading, and even writing to possibly developing a bad case of the flu, or just my general unusually high stress levels. However, at day 8, I noticed (by some grace) that while I thought I was typing full sentences/phrases, I actually only typed one word or two words, hence leaving out words but still believing I typed the whole sentence. I could barely remember what my PhD study was about, I couldn't read without stumbling or struggling to pronounce words, and I had very bad short term memory. I informed my partner, but we attributed it to stress. By day 10, I needed my partner's help to write basic sentences and had severe short term memory issues and trouble speaking. I tried filling out a form for my partner, since I have a neat handwriting, but it was a struggle. I decided to not take the melatonin last night, and woke up feeling refreshed and ""normal"" again. However, my partner brought me the form I filled out the previous day, and said he now completely believes me on the issues I was describing concerning my writing difficulties. I looked at the form but could see nothing wrong, until he pointed out that I had left out i.e. the middle parts of words, etc. For instance, we live in Waterberry Street, but I wrote Waterry Street.
I have never taken melatonin before. 
I have been on the following prescribed medicine: Anxiolytics (0.5mg Azor) and antidepressants (50mg Serdep) as well as birth control meds (Zoely) long term. 
Can someone advise me if it might be the melatonin causing all of this? My Doctor prescribed the melatonin since it isn't available over the counter in my country, and assured me it would help me sleep, but did not elaborate on any side effects. I am really worried because I have tight deadlines and I now have to recheck all the writing I've done on my PhD in the last 10 days, given my strange impairments.

Doctors can't agree but refuse testing since I don't have any family where I live now. I do have one uncle with crohns.

This isn't why I'm seeking help, but may provide insight. 

For the past couple of weeks or so, I just really haven't been hungry. For example, yesterday I had a bagel with cream cheese, a frappe, and tuna kimbap (tuna and veggies wrapped in rice with seaweed). I went to bed with what felt like slight hunger pains, but I felt disgusting full. Like... when you eat too much at dinner and think ""why did I eat so much????"". Today, I've had 1 kiwi, half of a tuna sandwich, M&Ms, 3 small cookies (think Oreo sized), 2 figs and a handful of grapes and I'm not hungry. I could have gone without the figs/grapes and felt fine. I know I didn't eat the healthiest today, but the thing is even if I have the smallest of snacks I'm suddenly full.

I don’t smoke, drink, or use recreational drugs. I’m diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, and I was taking 30mg of Vyvanse daily, but stopped when I found out I was pregnant. 

This is my third pregnancy. I had hyperemesis gravidarum the entire duration of my first pregnancy, but it was otherwise healthy and ended in a vaginal delivery last June. My second pregnancy was surgically terminated in January. I had a copper IUD in two months ago, but it ended up dislodging and getting stuck in my cervix. I had to have it removed in the ER. (Not sure if that’s relevant, but I don’t want to leave out any potentially important info.)

For the past 3 weeks (starting a week before I got a positive test), I’ve been having super intense cramping sensations on the lower right side of my abdomen (halfway between my bellybutton and right hipbone). At first I thought I was just about to start a rough period, but that obviously wasn’t the case. It got a bit better for a few days, but it came back today much worse than before. It especially hurts when I’m lying down on my left side or when anything touches my stomach even slightly. 

My abdomen and breasts are very tender and my morning sickness is already starting to kick in, but I haven’t experienced this kind of abdominal pain in either of my other pregnancies. It’s keeping me up tonight because it hurts too bad to fall asleep.

These symptoms could all be related or not at all. Sorry for the length, this has all been going on for a while and I’m starting to wonder if it’s linked. 

My problems started a few months after my son was born, he’s now 17 months old, so it has been going on for more than a year. Pre-pregnancy I was around 60kg, during pregnancy at my heaviest I was close to 70kg, and I have now been hovering around 50kg for about 8 months. I’m classed as underweight for my height and my clothes are loose. No changes in my diet that would explain the weight loss. 

I started having IBS symptoms when I started losing weight and I have loose bowels every day which is often accompanied by feelings of being very hot, sick, and tachycardia. 

I chalked up my fatigue to having a new baby but it has never subsided even though he’s been sleeping through the night for about six months now. Recent bloodwork showed that I have low iron despite the fact I’ve been taking an iron supplement for months. 

I suddenly developed unilateral tinnitus in February and it never went away (I have it right now as I’m typing). 

Ten days ago I noticed non-blanching purple spots on my left thigh (but no other acute symptoms apart from a bit of a headache) and I was advised to attend A&E which I did. I was given IV antibiotics and fluids but the bloodwork showed nothing so they let me go. I can still faintly see the rash. Today I developed petechiae in two more areas, again on my left thigh. There has been no trauma to the area or anything I can think of that would cause this. 

I noticed that my legs always seem to be covered in bruises and I never understand where they have come from. I saw my GP about all the issues above (apart from the most recent petechiae) and they couldn’t find anything wrong. 

Any thoughts as to what the heck is going on? Thank you.

Sex: Male  
Weight: 135 lbs  
Height: 5' 6""  
Smoking: Occasional cannabis vaping / smoking, occasional THC edibles, occasional CBD tinctures

So my life has been really stressful lately and I've had this lip issue for the past several months it just feels and looks inflamed.

I *(much ashamed of this)* more than often forget to brush my teeth at night because I am EXHAUSTED due to work (I am a delivery driver), which is what I'm guessing is contributing this lip condition. I am also on the road a lot so it's very difficult to find healthy things to eat on the job. I eat a very healthy overnight oatmeal in the morning \[organic rolled oats, Oatly Oatmilk, Organic Chia seeds, cinnamon, honey, yogurt, blueberries, mangoes, strawberries\]) but often find myself feeling hungry again during lunch time and resorting to high sodium jerky, chips, and tacos. Are there any lunches I can meal prep for myself that'll get that **\*tasty\*** craving I always crave and is healthy at the same time?

Will simply eating a better diet and brushing & flossing my teeth every night from this forth on fix my problem over time? Has anyone experienced this lip problem before? 

I also believe a Gastroenterologist diagnosed me with Irritable Bowel Syndrome around 8 months ago? Is the inflammation on my lips correlated with my gut health? I always feel discomfort in my intestinal areas and more than often go through diarrhea and I don't know why. I also suffer from pencil stools sometimes :( (but sometimes my poops are extremely light brown and healthy \[on days that I am not stressed\])

The pain presents directly in the center of my abdomen, above my belly button and below the end of my sternum. When pain occurs it lasts for specifically 4-6 hours, never less and never more. It’s hard to describe the pain precisely, but it’s a fiery ache that brings me to the floor, I usually resort to laying in the fetal position for the entire duration of pain but no position makes the pain better or worse. Sometimes I experience nausea and sometimes I don’t, my stomach does usually distended from bloating, but never usually accompanied by diarrhea. Interestingly I do find that my thinking gets foggy during these attacks, causing me to feel a bit loopy. This pain started out occurring every few days, but it now occurs daily, at completely random times. Food and drink do not worsen or help the pain! 

I started seeing a GI, and she gave me the works. I had a completely clear abdominal ultrasound which ruled out gallstones. Lots of blood work revealed that I have an unusual blood count- I have a 1% count of premature white blood cells. Tested negative for celiac disease. Just two days ago I had an EGD, biopsy results are not in yet. But we know there surprisingly is NO peptic ulcer, stomach and duodenum where completely clear. 
There was however variant mucosa present in my distal esophagus. (Link to photo below). My GI believes it is simply healed scarring from previous acid reflux. 

After all this I feel like there is no definite answer for the extreme pain. I am in dire need of some relief at this point, PLEASE!!!

AskDocs,29F. Help understanding EKG test results/impressions. Cardiology.,"Hi! I have a question about my echocardiogram vs 3 EKGS completed since then.

Background:

29, White Female, 5'6, 118lbs.Symptoms starting after the vaginal birth of only child 7 years ago.Initial fatigue/chronic pain worsening throughout the years to now multi-system signs and symptoms and decreased ability to function. Currently undergoing neurological assessment for hyperandrogenic POTS and awaiting a formal evaluation for EDS. Currently utilizing a 2-week cardiac event monitor to track symptoms as per cardiology.

Existing conditions; anxiety depression, ADHD-I, IBS-C, chronic headache, Migraine with visual/sensory aura, idiopathic hyperandergenism.

Current medications: Bupropion 150mg 2x daily, citalopram 20 mg 1x daily, Adderall 10 mg 2x daily, spironolactone 100mg 2x daily, multi-vitamin, Occasional use of Aleve/ibuprofen. Occasional use of low TCH CBD oil, sublingually for anxiety.

Not a drinker, never a smoker/drug user.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My medical conditions are being evaluated by a team of physicians and specialists, so that's not what my question is about, but background info is helpful. After sudden-onset worsening dyspnea with exertion, I had an echo done on 2/26, and since then have had multiple EKGs done (5/15, 9/8, 10/2).

My ECG results were reported as normal with trivial tricuspid regurgitation only, with heart size listed as normal.

My EKGs say otherwise;5/15 clinical impression reported as

**RAE-Right atrial enlargement-P>0.25mV 2 lds or<-0.24mV aVR/aVL**

**CRVH-Consider right ventricular hypertrophy-large R or R' V1/V2**

9/8 clinical impression reported as

**APC-Atrial premature complex-SV complex w/ short R-R interval**

**RAE-Right atrial enlargement-P>0.25mV 2 lds or<-0.24mV aVR/aVL**

**SD0IN-Minimal ST depression, inferior leads-ST <-0.04mV, II III aVF**

10/2 clinical impression reported as

**ST-Sinus tachycardia-rate>99**

**RAE-Right atrial enlargement-P>0.25mV 2 lds or<-0.24mV aVR/aVL**

**AXR-Borderline right axis deviation-QRS axis (90,110)**

**REPB-Borderline repolarization abnormality-ST dep & abnormal T**

&#x200B;

1. Can heart size change in 3 months, explaining the difference in ECG>EKG?
2. Can you please help me understand what these impressions mean? I am having difficulty getting them explained by physicians.
3. What are the implications of these conditions? Like, if I have atrial enlargement, what does that mean?

Thank you <3

AskDocs,"Severe, occasionally crippling but usually high functioning anxiety, are there medication options?","19F, 5'2, 130lbs, caucasian. I have vitamin D deficiency, which tends to impact my depression, but is currently 100% managed with OTC supplements, blood tests have returned within normal ranges during supplement use.

I drink occasionally, used to smoke recreationally (tobacco and weed) but have completely ceased both for some time now. I also used to use recreational drugs (dabbled in things like acid, MDMA, xanax, the aforementioned weed) but I also have completely stopped use for several months now.

I have experienced anxiety for many years, beginning before adolescence but over time only seeming to be getting worse overall. Specifically, social anxiety tends to be my main problem, but it is present in virtually every waking moment.

I have propranolol, 20mg I believe, to take on days which I will be experiencing something anxiety inducing, and it really helps. I tend to panic a lot less and I can stay calm and collected to do whatever needs to be done. The issue is that I feel very tired and lethargic the next day (and dont even get me started on taking it multiple days in a row- it only gets worse, not to mention lowering my already fairly low blood pressure), which is difficult because I do manual labor at my job, in 10 to 12 hour shifts. I really need my energy, so I have stopped taking this medicine almost entirely because its too much of a hindrance. Not to mention that I cant sleep for over 12 hours after I take it, so taking it any time other than as soon as I wake up would interrupt my sleep cycle.

SSRI's tend to give me bad reactions, such as excessive sleepiness to the point of 14+ hours of sleep in a day and a very 'off' sort of feeling. My experience is with Lexapro and Prozac.

My main question would be, is there any sort of medication that would meet what I need? Something that doesnt make me excessively sleepy, that I could take potentially multiple days in a row without significant side effects, or even every day that isnt an SSRI?",1,1,2020-10-26,induced labor,355,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,"[19F] lab results from my gyno came back---14nmol/L SHBG, but normal Testosterone and Progesterone (I'm also having an ultrasound in a week). Possible causes and Birth Control recommendations?","So, my blood results say:

6.7 pg/mL Free-Calc Testosterone
25 ng/dL Testosterone
68 ng/dL Progesterone

Edit: also, I realized this may matter
 31ng/mL Vitamin D 25-OH



Also, I'm 5'3.5"" and 185 lbs.

History:
Appointment 1 a few months back: 
I came in for a separate, nsfw bleeding issue*, which went away in the weeks that followed. My doctor wanted me to come back in 6-8 weeks for a follow-up appointment, which I postponed a week because of my period and then another week because of taking plan B (a condom issue occured). 

At the second appointment, she would see if the bleeding was gone (it was), do a normal appointment, do some blood work and prescribe an extra form of birth control.

*there's no need for this post to be nsfw, but said bleeding may be relevant to my diagnosis, so I'll include a SFW explanation. The basic just is: I experienced bleeding from my cervix the first 2-3 months I began [insert euphemism here]-ing, and it eventually went away. There was also a lot of pain the first few times because I tore part of my hymen. (I think this is SFW, since these are medical terms for female anatomy, and I don't talk about specifics?)
.
Appointment 2, a two weeks ago: 
My doctor did a full exam and said that everything looked healthy; however, she recommended getting an ultrasound because she suspects I have pcos (due to longer cycles and excess hair) (which I though was a bit much, but agreed to without objection). She decided to wait to prescribe birth control until after the lab results were back and the ultrasound was done.
.
Appointment 3: will be in a week from now, I'm going to have an ultrasound, talk about my lab results, and hopefully be prescribed birth control
.
.
.
.
Here are my main questions:
1) Since I don't have increased Testosterone levels, is pcos still a possibility?
2) What birth control option would be best for increasing my SHBG level? I know some help, and I'm hoping to use the ring based on my habits and lifestyle. Would this be a good idea hormonally?
3) Is there any other possible diagnosis or thoughts y'all have on my situation?",1,1,2020-12-29,full term birth,377,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,"Please help me understand what’s going on with the blood flow to my baby, getting so many different opinions from doctors","F28, height 5’6, weight 160lbs, 37 weeks + 2 days pregnant, non smoker, no alcohol, don’t have GD or preeclampsia, or any other health or pregnancy complications besides what is described in this post 

I’ve had a totally uneventful, healthy pregnancy, up until ten days ago, when at a routine ultrasound they spotted that the fetus was on the smaller side (AC around 10th percentile, fetal weight around 20th percentile), looked into the MCA PI, UA PI, and CPR and found the CPR to be in the 2nd percentile. The doctors recommended that we chug through until I hit 37 weeks and then induce, and that I come in every other day for monitoring. 

It’s been ten days, and the CPR has sort of hovered around the 5th percentile when it’s been measured, until today, when it measured 29th percentile. Each time I’m monitored the doctors say we should induce soon, but that everything looks okay to wait a couple days until my next monitoring appointment. 

Fairly consistently the UA has measured around the 90th percentile, and MCA has measured between 7th percentile and 20th percentile. Today, the MCA measured 25th percentile and UA measured in the 55th percentile, leading to a much higher CPR (29th percentile). 

Obviously these numbers seem great! I’m just so confused how this happened. The doctors in my previous appointments have indicated that it doesn’t really happen that these percentiles change so drastically. How and why would the UA PI drop so much over the course of a couple days? Is this normal and good? Or is it possible maybe the measurements were off today? Maybe all the other measurements were off and everything has been fine all along? 

I’m going back for more monitoring in a couple days and I’m wondering if I should expect everything to be totally normal and possibly to carry until I go into labor on my own, or whether it’s more likely that today’s measurements were off and they’ll go back down and I’ll still be recommended to induce early. I’d also just like to understand better what is going on with these flows. I tried to google it and had trouble understanding the results, which were mostly medical journal articles.

AskDocs,Unexplained hypoglycemia in postpartum Leiden factor V female,"A family member (35 yo F) has been having issues with unexplained hypoglycemia.  Currently 4 months postpartum.  During pregnancy was diagnosed as gestational diabetic (the most compliant diabetic you've ever seen).  She threw a nasty superior messenteric venous thrombus almost immediately after delivery which was fun and led us to the heterozygous Leiden diagnosis. She is back to her pre pregnancy weight (or darn close) at 125 lbs.

About a month ago she starts having bouts of hypoglycemia that occur late morning or early afternoon and happen almost every day.  We tried dietary changes with no results.  Contacted her ob who got her a 2 hour glucose tolerance test.  First hour was fine, second hour results: 22 followed with slurred speech and a small car accident.

We've been working for a month to get her into an endocrinologist but it's going to be at least another month so i figured I'd ask here for ideas on what this could possibly be.  Primary care is useless as he tried to start her on metformin which is contraindicated with Coumadin.

Last thing to add, I've never seen any of her finger sticks showing hyperglycemia and she's on Coumadin for the clotting disorder.  Also had two family members die of pancreatic cancer 2 generations ago (this is what I'm really scared about)

AskDocs,Requesting C-section under general anesthesia,"Hi everyone! Hoping to get some much needed insight...

I am a 29 year old female in Toronto, Canada with the condition Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH).  I suffer from debilitating headaches and I've got papillidema from the increased pressure. I've had multiple lumbar punctures in the past-  all leading to CSF leaks, low pressure headaches and blood patches. Needless to say I am very apprehensive to have anything go near my spinal cord due to the physical and emotional trauma caused.

I have been avoiding the idea of pregnancy for a long time as I know that it could potentially increase my symptoms and lead to further damage to my optic nerves and thus vision loss. Most of my symptoms are currently made worse by hormonal changes around my period so I'm worried about how pregnancy hormones will affect my pregnancy. 

With all this said, I am getting to the point where I desperately want to have a child with my partner and it is a life change that is very imminent. My concerns now mainly lie with the actual delivery process.

My main question is: given my health condition, am I allowed to request a cesarean section under general anesthesia? I absolutely do not feel comfortable with an epidural or spinal block and absolutely do not feel comfortable with a vaginal delivery as CSF pressure raises with pushing. 

I am terrified and apprehensive to get pregnant unless I know that my preferred method of delivery/anesthesia will be honored. I don't want to put myself more at risk.

I hope I can get some insightful answers! Thank you in advance :)",1,3,2020-08-17,pregnancy trauma,271,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,Urgent! Need advice on birthing.,"# Urgent - Wife and I need advice on when to get c-section

1. Yesterday, wife (female age 36, born 1984) and I went into hospital to check on baby. Wife is about 170cm tall, 70kg normally. Normal health and doesnt take any medications. Baby's due date is June 6, so just a few days later. We were trying for a VBAC, vaginal birth. The doctor said that the baby's heartbeat is weak, therefore having a c-section would be best. He was very very insistent on pushy on this.
2. After we agreed to do the c-section and went into the hospital, another nurse looked at the chart and said the heartbeat is completely normal. She also said that in the past, she has seen the doctor push patients towards c-section so he can collect more room fees. So now we think maybe the best thing to do is wait. Although the doctor keeps pushing for c-section.
3. Wife had a previous baby and was almost 2 weeks overdue. In the end, she had to induce labor, but that led to complications, and so the 1st baby was a c-section. I'm worried that because the 1st baby was late, the 2nd will be late as well. And since the 1st pregnancy was complicated, we cant induce labor. But if the labor comes too late again, that might have more complications.

Any advice? What is best thing to do?",1,2,2020-06-03,induced labor,238,,,,,,,,,

Doesn't drink, no drugs. 

&#x200B;

My transgender partner has severe social anxiety it is hard for her to leave the house. So medical care has been sparse.

&#x200B;

She was born prematurely and had some hacked together nasal passages due to this, she has mentioned having plastic tubes installed in her nasal passages at birth I'm not sure how correct that is.

&#x200B;

She has had a lifelong issue with congestion, always sinus troubles. Lately 5 nights a week she sleeps maybe a couple of hours a day, spends a long time in the shower trying to decongest.

&#x200B;

She has been using, repeatedly (1 bottle a week of each) the following nose sprays: oxymetolazine and phenylephrine. This has been happening now for close to 2 years.

&#x200B;

In the last couple of months she has used sudafed pills to sleep every second night. We have also bought a humidifier for the bedroom and run AC to make sure she sleeps comfortably when she can sleep.

&#x200B;

I realize she now probably has rebound congestion from all of the nose sprays continuously, so what do we do? How do we solve this, I'm so scared she will stop being able to breathe. Some nights she fights for breath. Some mornings she wakes up suddenly unable to breathe and runs to a steaming shower to help it. Please help.

BabyBumps,Nervous about going overdue (FTM in UK),"(Posted this on the August bumpers group but more people here would see it too!)

I’ll be 40 weeks on the 24th August and I’m already so stressed about going overdue. I’ve been under consultant led care from weeks 28-36 as baby girl had dropped significantly on her growth trajectory (90th percentile to 10th-30th). This has meant I’ve had almost weekly scans and we didn’t think we were ever going past 37 weeks (we were preparing for steroid shots and buying tiny baby clothes as she wasn’t expected to stay in until August). The last 2 scans though she’s sat around 50th percentile so I’ve been discharged from consultant led care back to midwife led care. At the last consultant appointment I was told I’d be induced at 40+12 if baby was still stubborn, I actually could have cried as it just felt like I was hearing pregnancy was going to last 5 weeks longer!

Other than her growth concerns I’ve been in hospital a couple times for baby’s heart rate being too high and a couple days ago my hands ended up blue from swelling (it looked like I had bruises from punching across all my knuckles and fingers!) Baby always calms down enough for the hospital to let me go, but now I’m worried about going over for both her sake and my own - I’ve had back pain from 18 weeks and SPD from 32 weeks, my hips and pelvis are wrecked!

I’ll be 41 weeks on the 31st (which is also my birthday and I really don’t want to have the same birthday!) and 41+5/ 40+12 on Sept 5th. 

I really want baby to arrive before the end of August for a few reasons:

1. I’m worried about increasing risks of her being in up to 40+12 considering the issues I’ve had with the pregnancy (especially as we had so many concerns with her growth/ potential placenta issues and the placenta degrades as time goes on). 
2. I'm struggling more and more with SPD
3. So she can make it into that school year (UK specific!) - I dont want baby to have to wait a year longer to go to school (she would have to be in daycare anyway as husband and I both work full time)
4. I don't want us to have the same birthday (a superficial reason I know)

I’m already trying every old wives tale I can to try and encourage baby!

I next see my midwife on the 26th (40+2) where I’m hoping to get a sweep (no cervical checks available prior to 40 weeks in my trust) has anyone (especially in the UK) advocated for earlier inductions than the hospital ‘standard’? The thought of going 12 days over is stressing me out so much!",1,6,2020-08-20,overdue,465,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Unclear on Dysmenorrhea and implications,"I'm a 27 year old female and I have a history of painful, long, heavy, irregular periods starting when I was 14. I live in a rural area with one women's clinic and a few other hospitals and small clinics, but there really are not a lot of options for medical care. I have a primary care doctor that is great for a lot of things, but I go to the women's clinic for my Nexplanon implant. The only other medication I take is a 24 hour release 15 mg adderall.

I just had my Nexplanon replaced (this is my second now) about 4 months early because my periods came back in full force and I was miserable. The people at the women's clinic tried to talk me into an IUD, but I expressed that with my pelvic pain during periods, I'm unwilling to try something that is inserted, and Nexplanon did very well for me for the most part. They asked me a little about my symptoms and agreed that sticking to what I know works would be best for my dysmenorrhea. This is the first time I'd heard that word, and they clarified that it was just the word for ""painful periods."" I came home and did some digging, looking at the symptoms, and it does kind of fit the bill. Two things threw me off- I mentioned that during my period, my sciatic nerve pinches really badly, and my labia feel bruised and painful to the point of having to be careful how I sit. I didn't see anything about that anywhere, even after trying to research that specifically. I've talked to my primary care doctor about this as well, and we did hormone tests that came back relatively normal, and she kind of... discouraged me from being examined to look for endometriosis. Her reasoning is that its invasive, and since my birth control fixes the problem, it would be unnecessary. 

My doctor has been so great about other things, but after learning the term ""dysmenorrhea"" from another doctor I had seen one time and thinking about her discouraging me from further examination or testing, I'm really unsure about trusting her on this issue. Is she probably right and just sticking to birth control to manage my pain the right course of action? I don't want children, so this seems viable to me. On the other hand, could leaving the cause unknown exacerbate the problem without my knowledge and cause serious health issues down the line? The whole situation has me really confused about if I'm overreacting or not. I don't want to make the situation worse by trusting her, and I WANT to trust her, but I can't help but feel like it might be a mistake.",1,1,2020-06-22,full term birth,461,,,,,,,,,

Since I haven't been smoking I've been unable to really eat well, but I've been managing to consume a little every now and then but its been 3-4 days. 

Every morning I wake up with fluttering in my chest and shallow? Heavy heartbeat idk how to describe it but it's almost like electricity and a thundering heartbeat. It consists through out the day. Sometimes if im not laying down it feels worse, other times I'm not wanting to lay down because I'm anxious for it to happen again. 

I take my gabapentin , and still have these issues. I can take up to 300mgs. Nothing im calm. My mind isn't racing yet I still feel this fluttering. I never have chest pain, but one time there was a light dull pain but I don't know if its the lung or not. 

I'm fatigued and unmotivated. Sometimes going up an elevated street takes away my breath or going up 1 flight of stairs. Sometimes I'm woozy. 

I've been dealing with nausea and severe acid reflux, excessive burping and sometimes vomiting due to the acidity making me sick. Or at times I'm unable to eat because its so uncomfortable.  I take omeprazole 20mg daily and sometimes it just doesn't help. And I can press on my diaphragm sometimes and force a burp out unnaturally sometimes too. It's very upsetting and daily.

I've been having diarrhea sometimes. Its been green and runny and sometimes my tummy gets upset. 

I've taken my blood pressure (113/71). Last night it was high. My heart rate currently is 70bpm. 

Constant temperature changes. Sometimes it feels like my skin is burning then it gets really cold and im shivering but sweating or clammy. Especially in the hands and feet. My mom just told me my temperature was low with the heater on 80° and in the last hour I've complained like 20 times about my body getting hot or cold or both out of no where. I can't even lay under my blankets with the window open at 36°..this happens off and on. My hands are usually drenched in sweat but I'm cold.",1,6,2020-12-07,premature birth,455,,,,,,,,,

June 7 2020 [start] - Now. My current period has lasted 13 days so far, with no signs of it really letting up. It’s a bit lighter than it was a few days ago, but not by much. Honestly at this point I’m just tired of dealing with it every time I go to the bathroom. 

As outlined above, my periods have been erratic lately to say the least. I am working towards getting on birth control with my doctor, however the patch would best fit my lifestyle but I am over the weight limit. I am working towards losing weight (was ~145 pre-pregnancy, went up to nearly 350 just before delivery, was down 210, quarantine has made exercise & eating healthier a bit harder) and will hopefully be on birth control within the next 6 months, I’m hoping that will regulate my period a bit.

AskDocs,25M - Extreme pain surrounding elbow and tricep,"25M 130 pounds, 5'9"". Significant scoliosis.

About two days ago I started developing a slight pain in my elbow. For the past two days I would rate it about a 4/10. Ladt night and this morning I am in agony.

Here's the story: I have pretty severe scoliosis, and went to PT for many years. This year covid-19 hit, so i haven't seen my PT since March. I spoke with him, he gave me some exercises to keep up, and its been very beneficial. Mostly stretches and yoga types of movements.

I've done some movements for strengthening but nothing crazy, I definitely don't overdue anything. I'll do 3 sets of 10 pull ups and 3 sets of 20 pushups, with planking. 
I did this on Monday night, and did a few more than usual but really did not feel like I pushed myself. 
The next day, Tuesday I took a long hike, about 13 miles. As I was hiking, my elbow felt sore but I thought nothing of it.
Wednesday the soreness was more noticeable.
Yesterday about the same, so i did some light stretches with my arm, it began to feel better.
Today, the pain increased. It is located near where my elbow meets my triceps. It was 3am and I cant sleep because of the severity of the pain. My entire tricep and elbow is in intense pain, probably a 9/10. It is not swollen, other wise I would post pictures. 

Is this tendinitis? Orbital tunnel syndrome? How should I proceed?
Any help would be appreciated.",1,1,2020-10-24,overdue,258,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Urgent! Need advice on birthing.,"# Urgent - Wife and I need advice on when to get c-section

1. Yesterday, wife (female age 36, born 1984) and I went into hospital to check on baby. Wife is about 170cm tall, 70kg normally. Normal health and doesnt take any medications. Baby's due date is June 6, so just a few days later. We were trying for a VBAC, vaginal birth. The doctor said that the baby's heartbeat is weak, therefore having a c-section would be best. He was very very insistent on pushy on this.
2. After we agreed to do the c-section and went into the hospital, another nurse looked at the chart and said the heartbeat is completely normal. She also said that in the past, she has seen the doctor push patients towards c-section so he can collect more room fees. So now we think maybe the best thing to do is wait. Although the doctor keeps pushing for c-section.
3. Wife had a previous baby and was almost 2 weeks overdue. In the end, she had to induce labor, but that led to complications, and so the 1st baby was a c-section. I'm worried that because the 1st baby was late, the 2nd will be late as well. And since the 1st pregnancy was complicated, we cant induce labor. But if the labor comes too late again, that might have more complications.

Any advice? What is best thing to do?",1,2,2020-06-03,overdue,238,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,IUD questions (TMI) but would really like answers (:,"26, female, 180lbs, I’m taking vitamins and levothyroxine. 

Hi! Back in July of 2019 I was 3 months PP and they had me do the Mirena IUD. I felt great before I got it I had gotten lab work done and all was normal they gave me the iud and that night I had the worst pain, worse than labor. The dr said it was normal. 

The next day I was still in so much pain but it continued up until recently. I also developed hypothyroid after getting it in place. Never had any tests show I was even bordering it, then I have had severe menstrual pain and very heavy bleeding 20 days out of the month every month. 

Last two months it suddenly only lasted 4 days and this month it stopped, no bleeding but severe pain again. I called them they said it was normal and it probably stopped my period they had me take a pregnancy test from home so I bought 7 and took them all negative. I called them to ask about what else I could do and all they said was it’s normal and to take Tylenol. I have been living on Tylenol. 

Side note: they wouldn’t allow me a pill because I was diagnosed with untreated depression in highschool and I have severe periods anyways and they wanted to do this. They offered a hysterectomy but I’m not sure I want one. Not this early on (I’m only 26) but I know we won’t be having anymore children already have one each.",1,9,2020-06-17,early labor,260,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,"My (7f) daughter (47in, 56lbs) is scheduled for EGD w/biopsy Thursday if negative for COVID test Tuesday, trying to see if EGD is premature at this point.","My daughter has expressed that her chest/stomach/throat hurts starting a few weeks ago. No vomiting, no diarrhea, no fever, no weight loss and the only thing that seemed to start this was a fruit snack got stuck in her throat a couple weeks ago and it scared her. She went to her pediatrician after complaining for several days about her throat, stomach, and chest hurting, and he found nothing. He referred her to a GI who ordered an X-ray fluoro esophagram. Test results all normal, no reflux noted, organs and bones normal. He scheduled her for an EGD this Thursday if her COVID test comes back negative. He recently prescribed her 10 mg Famotodine, but we haven’t received it yet but should tomorrow. The question is, should we wait and see if the prescription helps first before such an invasive procedure on her? I’m certainly NAD, and just looking for advice. Watching her closely this past week while we were on vacation, she rarely complained about it as long as her mind was occupied and she was having fun. She would only mention it if she was bored or not otherwise occupied. It seems to me, knowing her, and seeing how she reacts to things that it may have something to do with anxiety. It could very well be reflux and it scares her when it happens but it seems like she fears it more than it actually seems to bother her. I just worry that the COVID test and EGD will scare her even more and may make future trips to the doctor more difficult.",1,6,2020-07-19,prematurity,266,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Abdominal point tenderness/pain,"39F, 5’3, 124lb, Caucasian. 

Existing conditions: hypothyroidism (controlled), depression, PTSD, panic attacks (controlled), insomnia (controlled). 

Medications: Levothyroxine, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Trazodone. 

No smoking or drugs, occasional alcohol. 

Went gluten free in January of this year and follow an anti-inflammatory diet for optimal thyroid function. I have lost weight due to this change (37 lbs), though it was not my intention and I’m really not complaining about it, but also dismisses it as any potentially related symptom. 

On October 7th, I had a telehealth appointment with my PCP and Sjögren Syndrome was on the radar (not sure if this is any correlation, but is the reason I had many tests done). On Oct. 28, I had an in-person visit to go over symptoms and what not. Between the time of the telehealth visit and the in-person visit, I started having abdominal point pain slightly above my belly button and point near my right hip. 

Appendicitis was briefly considered, but didn’t make sense to me with the duration of pain and no increase to associate. A CT with and without contrast was done as well as a lot of blood tests (looking at aforementioned Sjögren’s and for anything that could signal the abdominal pain). CT was normal, as was most blood work, other than showing slight anemia and vitamin d deficiency. Rheumatologist weighed in and suggested supplements. 

I was sent on my way being called a “medical mystery” and to try tums. Abdominal tenderness continues. It’s not a constant pain, just a feeling of soreness when slight pressure is applied across my abdomen (when my kids sit on my lap and lean against me, or when they wrap their legs around me for a big hug). Increased pressure in the midline near my belly button and off to the right hip do hurt substantially. Thursday afternoon, I got a sudden and persistent nausea which has continued through today. 

Any idea what the pain could be originating from that a CT might have missed? Would this new nausea be related or maybe something different? No chance of pregnancy. 😉

I feel like I’m not going to find any relief bc the CT was normal, as was most blood results, and I’m classified as a mystery. 😕",1,7,2020-12-12,PTSD pregnancy,372,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,"Constant overheating in standard conditions - causing debilitating and profuse total body sweating so bad - I had to leave my lifelong, front-facing career/industry...","So grateful in advance and feeling so helpless. I'm a 37 year old female - 5'9/145 lbs, former D1 collegiate athlete - not terribly actively lately due to busy work schedule - but completely ""fit"" by BMI/aesthetic purposes. 5 years ago...i slowly developed an increased propensity to sweating, whenever i'd perform a mild activity - that wouldnt make others sweat. For instance - a ping pong game with friends, or running out to the mailbox...it started getting progressively worse, exponentially - to the point, this past winter - I would have to carry my coat in below freezing weather on my walk to the train in the morning - because if i wore my coat, by the time i got on the train, id be so flushed...and worse, soaking and dripping with sweat from my head down my face that it would horrify others so bad, i'd have to get off the train. My job used to be face to face meetings with clients each week - and i had to stop, because even walking from my building, to the car, parking, and walking up to a new office, would send me into a soaking wet overheated mess. 

When this happens - my entire body sweats (not just armpits feet palms)...and its not just sweat - im burning up from within, as if i'd just run a marathon. It usually subsides within 5 minutes - though im soaking wet - often then freeezing cold as now the air conditioning or winter air is meeting my sweaty body. 

Last winter i proactively went to GP to get overall tests on blood/urine/general health levels...and everything came up almost alarmingly perfect. The GP put me on mild dose of benztropine - aimed to illicit the side effect it produces at higher levels in parkinsons patients ... though (1 i didnt stop sweating and 2) i couldnt handle the ""hangover"" feel. 

Its gotten so terrible, that i had to lay in front of my fan for 20 minutes after walking down 2 flights of stairs to pick up a delivery order. Definitely stopped socializing (before Covid) in recent months...even friends and coworkers that understand and non judgemental - its just the discomfort. 

Non Smoker. Eat healthy. Recently - last month - totally unrelated...i had a random case of orbital cellulitis - after a routine biopsy on my nose - and was in ICU for 5 days. the anomoly in my case...was that the typical fever associated with such infection - was never present - i'm usually 98.1 when i go to the doctor - even when i should be at 104!

BabyBumps,"12 weeks, TERRIFIED of vaginal birth/tearing, considering c-section","Hi all!

So I'm currently 12 weeks pregnant with my first child, and I am starting to consider my birthing options.  Tbh the thought of going through vaginal birth terrifies me, I cannot picture myself doing it.  The thought of tearing makes me sick to my stomach. My mom had 3 C-sections and I guess I always just thought if I ever had a baby I would have one too.  

Well, after doing some research, apparently elective C-sections aren't as common as I thought they were, and there's a good chance that my insurance won't cover it.  I haven't spoken to my ob about this yet, because of covid I have only had one appointment so far and won't be seeing her again until July.  I am 35, and so far there haven't been any complications with my pregnancy although because of my age I am considered ""high-risk"".  

I guess what I'm looking for is women who elected to have a c-section to share your experience with me - how did you broach the conversation with your ob?  What were your reasons for choosing surgery?  Would you make the same decision again?  Did your insurance cover it and if not, how much was your out of pocket costs?

If you're one of those mombies that believes that you're not a real woman/mom if you don't give birth naturally, kindly fuck off and stay off this thread.

BabyBumps,Update: have the diabeetus. How to induce labor?,"Welp. I didn't stand a chance. Glucose was 4mg over after my 12 hour fast before I even drank the stuff. So now I need to know any ideas to induce labor asap at the start of August Because I refuse to be induced if I can help as it will be way too traumatic. Please help. Also any tips for dealing with this until August. By then I'll be 36 weeks and it will be safe to have her 

EDIT FOR CLARITY ON WHY THIS IS NECESSARY:
I have sexual trauma. It will be traumatic. I already know this. I already had planned with a midwife they would wait til 42 weeks before inducing and no cervix checks and touch me as little as possible. Being induces and having GD means I get none of what was promised now . On top of the CPTSD I have autism so being touched and any needles (so all the IVs for pitocin and other bs) also have me traumatized.

BabyBumps,"Any helpful hints to stay full term, make it to the due date?","This pregnancy I found out I will have a baby with a congenital heart defect and she will have surgery just a few days after her scheduled csection which is set for two days before her EDD. 
My first pregnancy went to exact due date. And even with that it was full moon, I had the membrane sweep the prior week, water broke first, etc. then labor was delayed because I got scared when they kept telling me things I didn’t understand (like dry birth, slow labor, weak labor, you can’t get there without pitocin+epidural) and finally I ended up using all the fun stuff plus getting a csection. So while I’m a STM I have no experience with pushing a baby out. My first was on his way out by the time his heart rate went down so much that they pushed him back up to do a csection. 
So, with this pregnancy being high risk because of her defect, I really want to do everything I can to make it my csection date. I know we cannot plan for everything (remember I’m having a baby with a heart defect, didn’t plan for that) so I’m not expecting this all to be rules for it work or guides that are full proof. 
If we can have a discussion of your opinions, experiences, things you think make you deliver early and could be a possible cautionary tale, etc. I’d like to hear them all.

AskDocs,"24M - When I was born, I suffered from bilateral pneumothorax - Might I expect an increased risk of COVID-19 complications?","I am a 24 year old white male, 6' 2"", about 160 lbs.

As the title says, my mom had a pretty tough labor period when I was brought into the world and I ended up being a C-section birth. I know that both she and I were knocking on death's door for about 36 hours as I suffered from a bilateral pneumothorax. As far as I know, I have never had any lung issues since surviving that incident. 

I'm curious whether this early life experience might increase the chances that I experience complications related to COVID-19 in the event that I catch the virus. As of the time of writing this, I don't have any symptoms and have no reason to believe that I've been exposed. However, my state has just decided to 're-open' and I just wanted to know. I'm guessing that there isn't much, if any, information on this particular combination of conditions right now as we continue to learn more about the novel coronavirus. So I'm asking this fully aware that there may not be a concrete answer. I appreciate any input!
