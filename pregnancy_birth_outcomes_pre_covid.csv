BabyBumps,I compiled every piece of morning sickness advice. Please enjoy.,"Congratulations! You're pregnant. You know you are pregnant because all of the healthy foods you planned to eat make you want to vomit. And also, there's cheeto dust on your hands. 

Here are some things to help with your nausea. 

Eat something small as soon as you wake up, although you were almost certainly woken by nausea so it is probably too late. Also, only eat simple bland foods that you can handle, like crackers. But don't eat any foods that will spike your blood sugar, like crackers. And don't go on an empty stomach. 

Avoid coffee, which can make your nausea worse. Instead, take unisom+B6 twice a day, because you can't be nauseous when you are unconscious. Also, take it on the empty stomach you could not possible tolerate.

Avoid strong smells, such as peppermint, ginger and the god-awful, unmistakable vitamin -smell, but always take your vitamins. Also, peppermint and ginger can help with nausea, so keep some on hand at all times. 

You can try sucking on hard candy during the day, it PROBABLY won't cause gestational diabetes, but you know Myaleigh didn't have any refined carbs during her pregnancy and her son Dylaleigh just got in to baby Harvard, so... 

Also, we know you're trying to avoid letting people know that you're pregnant, so wear these VERY VISABLE and hideous Sea Bands. Just tell people you just came back from jazzercise. It will help that you're already sweaty.

Drink at least a gallon of water a day, but only take small sips. Or better yet, ice chips. Have one gallon a day of ice chips. One chip a minute for 24 hours a day, that sounds about right. And also, get plenty of sleep while marathon ice chipping. Don't worry, your AM sleeping pill should help with that. 

And if things get really bad, you can always get stronger meds like zofran. Your mother in law definitely won't say things like, ""well, in my day, we weren't allowed to take ANYTHING for nausea. We just dealt with it..."" 

THANKS, SHARON

But seriously, you're probably just feeling a little stressed. Just lie down for a minute, you'll be fine. Lying flat definitely won't make you immediately vomit from the acid rushing up your esophagus.

Happy Magical Pregnancy!




Okay, trolling over. Thank you for indulging in my rant. I'm at 8w with twins and I might die. 

Now excuse me, i missed like 8 ice chips while writing this.

BabyBumps,27 weeks. What’s the best ways you’ve found to relax and de-stress. Especially if you feel guilty about stressing during pregnancy.,"So for context, my husband and I are currently selling our home and I’m working on my masters (until the baby arrives). I’m a natural worrier, so of course I’m stressed during this time. He keeps saying everything will be fine, and my family just keeps saying “don’t worry, just focus on the baby”. None of that is helping because then I worry that the baby is feeling my stress and anxieties. So what’s the best way, if you’ve been stressed and pregnant, to relax and not be anxious?",7,8,2019-06-07,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,WARNING! RANT! Coworker(F) giving me a hard time after finding out about my pregnancy!,"A little bit of background to this. I have a coworker that I have worked with for 3 years now. I work for a small office, only 5 employees and we share an office together. We've been involved in each other's lives and do things outside of work since I started working here, and have created mutual friends along with that, so she feels that she can give unsolicited advice CONSTANTLY. 

I started a weight loss journey in Jan 2017 and lost 50 pounds and was successful with my goals. Maintained my weight through my 1 1/2 year engagement up to my wedding. During that time, she made comments on my weight loss and how I was trying to starve myself and try to not get ""too skinny."" I looked at that as a little bit of jealousy since she is over weight and ""tries"" to diet and then eats constantly through out the work day. 

After just getting married in December, we have found out we are pregnant with baby #1, due is September. It was not planned, but we were for sure not preventing, and was not expecting it to happen so soon. The moment she found out she started commenting on the food I would eat. Mind you, morning sickness has not been kind. Especially in the late afternoon and evening, so I have been eating little snacks throughout my day. I was addicted to coffee before this and the fact I couldn't drink as much and then realizing morning sickness wasn't allowing me to keep it down has not helped with my demeanor either. She would constantly say that what snacks I am eating isn't baby friendly, and that I need to give baby the food it needs and eat more. This is obviously all new to me. I've never been pregnant before. The fact you fight the urge to throw up every time you yawn is a mental struggle in itself and the fact that you yawn constantly cause you're tired from growing a human! 

Recently our boss called in to ask how I was doing, her response as she starred at me working, **""She's just wallowing in self-pity, she needs to get over it, cause this is her life now.""** She gets off the phone and look at her and say **""Was that about me?""** She says yes and how she thinks I'm being a little dramatic with my feelings. Hormone Beast then unleashes. I then say **""Have you ever been pregnant before?""** She responds no, to which I reply **""THEN SHUT THE F\*\*K UP.""** My best friend believes that it's jealousy as she lives with her boyfriend of 12 years and is no where near where she wanted to be at this point. She has admitted in the past that she thinks life sucks cause everyone around her got married and is having babies and she doesn't see her BF giving that to her. I'M SORRY BUT THAT IS NOT MY FAULT. I firmly believe that if there is something about your life that you don't like, do something about it. You hold your destiny. I am now leaving this job for a part time position at another company to help give me a less stressful pregnancy and easier transition after baby is born, and I don't see the attitude and judgement ending even until my last day. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for letting me vent. I just know there are ladies here that have probably been in this situation and I hate how some women can't be supportive towards their fellow women out there. Rant over. ",511,145,2019-02-19,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,C-Sections: Lessons Learned and FYI," 

I made this \[comment in this thread\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/ax9jsq/one\_tip\_from\_a\_new\_dad\_hope\_for\_the\_best\_plan\_for/ehsc0w7/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/ax9jsq/one_tip_from_a_new_dad_hope_for_the_best_plan_for/ehsc0w7/?context=3)), and many people told me they found it useful, and wish they had known before their unplanned or emergency c-sections, so I figured maybe I should make my own post to reach more people! My c-section saved my life and the life of my child. Because of that first c-section we are both alive today, and I am now pregnant with my second. This new baby will be delivered by scheduled c-section in August. I also hate seeing new moms on here feeling guilty about having a c-section. So here I am as a pro SURVIVING BIRTH angry ranting mom. I am not a medical professional, though I have many in my family, this is all just based on my experience. 

&#x200B;

I really didn't think I'd end up with a c-section. Not that I had any qualms about them, just that my family history is great at giving birth to big babies with no complications. No one I’m blood related to has had any birth complications AT ALL (this is going back at least three generations too), with many of these babies over 8lbs. We knew my baby was big, but again, I wasn’t that concerned. I had been a big baby myself (8lbs10oz), and my mom delivered me easily. Well, thanks to my husband, my big baby also has a really big head (90th percentile) which was too big, and she got stuck. Hadn’t moved down the birth canal AT ALL after two hours of pushing kind of stuck. So even me, with my family history of AMAZING births, low risk pregnancy, I needed a c-section. I’ve never felt any guilt or shame over it, as I clearly needed it. It probably also helped that the c-section itself was super positive, and all my doctors were really kind. My kid was not in distress, just stuck, so it wasn’t a stressful event. Though without the c-section we both would have eventually died, since there was no way she was coming out vaginally. I do want to note that my incision got infected a week postpartum and developed a seroma (pocket of fluid and blood which burst), so my recovery was a bit worse than average, which will affect some of my advice and experience. I'm also a redhead which apparently means I feel more pain? The nurses and doctors also told me that since I went all the way through labour first, I also had a harder recovery. As I’ve only had the one birth, I can’t say, but it was a pretty hard recovery! Anyways, here are my tips and lessons learned from my experience as an unplanned c-section mama:

&#x200B;

\- Actually I give everyone this advice, but make sure your hospital bag has room for your “street clothes.” My labour bag did not, and since we had to switch rooms a couple times (from labour to OR to recovery to postpartum) my shoes got misplaced. Luckily we found them again, but lesson learned! Also I got so swollen while in the hospital that I couldn’t even wear them home, so bring loose fitting shoes. 

&#x200B;

\- Read about c-section experiences before birth. I had done this, and so when they were tugging the baby out, which you REALLY feel (though no pain) it's SO weird. You really feel yanked about! I think it would have been quite scary if I hadn't known about it.

&#x200B;

\- I have heard some people feel shocked at the amount of people in the room during the surgery. Hopefully someone who knows more specifics can chime in, but there’s a good number of people in the OR during surgery, more if the baby is in distress. I was pretty out of it by this point so I didn't really care. 

&#x200B;

\- I also recommend getting “the first family picture” during surgery, if possible. I love that photo! 

&#x200B;

\- My surgeon also did delayed cord clamping and we did skin to skin after they examined her. There are ways to bring in some of your “birth plan” in a c-section. Always worth asking! Obviously in a emergency c-section they would not do these things. 

&#x200B;

\- Also, many people, myself included, get the shakes after surgery, and feel so so cold. I don't remember the reason, but it's super common. Again I probably would have been frightened if I hadn't heard about it. 

&#x200B;

\- You’ll be cathed, so when you stand up after a c-section, you’ll drip blood all over the floor, since it will run down the cath tube. I haven’t confirmed this with other c-section mamas, but it was an experience. Luckily the nurses knew it was going to happen, and were very reassuring that it was no big deal. Happened every time I stood up until they took the cath out. 

&#x200B;

\- Laughing will hurt SO MUCH, so don’t watch any comedy shows for a while, and if you’re loading shows onto a tablet for recovery, NO COMEDY. Also tell any comedians in your life to only make dad jokes, as chuckling and eye rolling does not hurt. 

&#x200B;

\- Bring slippers or flip flops to the hospital that you don't need to bend down to put on. I did not do this, so if there wasn't anyone around to help me, I went barefoot, which you don't really want to do in the hospital... I also wore my slippers for a couple hours once because I couldn't get them off myself, and didn't want to bug the nurses. Lesson learned! Also get ones you don’t mind if you bleed on them…

&#x200B;

\- They want to make sure your bowels work after the c-section, which can cause issues with that, so they encourage the taking of laxatives after surgery. Well I had never taken laxatives before, and it turns out I am really sensitive to them, and the dose they gave, gave me insane diarrhea for 3 days. So maybe try out lax-a-day (which is the one they gave me) before birth…

&#x200B;

\- You’ll have a longer hospital stay with a c-section, so I suggest everyone prepares as if they are going to spend 2-3 days in the hospital. 

&#x200B;

\- A c-section can cause delays in your milk coming in. Super normal, but a bit annoying. We gave her formula and the tiny drops we managed to pump until my milk came in, I think 4 or 5 days postpartum. We had a lot of troubles getting breastfeeding going even after my milk came in, so if you have access to LCs, take advantage of them! And if you get a bad one (they do exist) try another one. Also, this isn’t just for c-sections, breastfeeding should NOT hurt. Sure, it may be uncomfortable, but if it’s excruciating, stop and get help. DO NOT PUSH THROUGH THE PAIN, you can injure yourself. My daughter had a tongue tie which needed to be snipped, and then we needed to teach her to suckle instead of chomping down/nibbling action. The help we got from the LCs was invaluable! I had one nurse try to bully me into breastfeeding at the hospital, saying I needed to push through the pain, luckily at that point I was so battered I was refusing to put her on until I healed (which the hospital LCs supported). Because I let myself heal, and got help early, we were able to get back to breastfeeding successfully (with a lot of work, was not simple journey). Not that I judge anyone who chooses not to breastfeed, or can’t breastfeed. I’m a firm supporter of the fed is best movement. Formula is amazing stuff, and I am so grateful that it was available to nourish my child before I could, and that it was available to nourish her if breastfeeding didn't work. 

&#x200B;

\- Read up about wound care and what infection looks like. My incision got infected and developed a seroma. I got medical attention right away, and so nothing became serious (though it certainly FELT serious when the seroma burst.) Also if you aren't sure, and are worried about your incision (or your stitches if you've had a vaginal birth) go to the doctor. Early intervention is best. I know a lot of c-section mamas, but I don’t know anyone else who had these issues happen to them, so it’s not common. 

&#x200B;

\- Everyone says this, but TAKE YOUR MEDS. Don't be a hero, take your meds. You’re already a fucking hero getting sliced open to bring your baby safely into the world. They wouldn't give you meds that aren't safe in breastfeeding (and if you're unsure about this, ask) so take your meds. Because of the infection I was on the good stuff for longer than most, and I have no regrets. 

&#x200B;

\- If you have a long drive home, ask for some extra meds. You’re going to feel EVERY BUMP IN THE ROAD. My ride home was really short, but it was still so painful. This time around, I'm going to be asking for some of the good meds even for my short ride home. 

&#x200B;

\- Like vaginal and complication free births, the more you can do before, will help after. Our house was really clean, and we had some freezer meals prepared, which helped so much. I couldn't do much of anything for the first two weeks (made worse by the infection) so my husband had to do a lot, and it made life easier. Which when you just had major surgery and you're taking care of a newborn, anything that makes life easier is ESSENTIAL.

&#x200B;

\- Have some high waisted underwear on hand. Do you know the seam of EVERYTHING is right where your incision is going to be? My mom got me the ugliest granny panties ever, not great for the self esteem, but they were essential for the first while. (Until my seroma burst and I had a big bandage in front of my incision to catch the blood and fluid, so I could wear my normal underwear with that, but again, that doesn’t happen to most people.)

&#x200B;

\- I found a changing table essential. I haven’t confirmed this with other c-section mamas, so this might just be me, but even bending over the bed or couch to change a diaper would have been impossible. Our changing table was just a mat on a dresser, so nothing fancy, but it was essential for the first couple weeks, and I used it for months. I'd love to hear if other c-section mamas found this, as I've only heard from non-c-section mamas how unnecessary changing tables are..  

&#x200B;

\- I actually recommend this piece of advice for all new moms, not just us c-section mamas, but have some less mighty pads on hand. Yes, have the super mighty long pads on hand too, but I found as my bleeding slowed, and I didn’t need them anymore, I found them uncomfortable. Because of the c-section (and it was terribly cold and snowy out), I had to send other people to the store to get less mighty pads, which was a pain (I prefer to pick out my own.) Where I am (Alberta, Canada) they don’t recommend you use adult diapers, since the amount of blood in a pad can show if something is going wrong, but I still think this advice fits for people who use adult diapers. I can imagine those get really uncomfortable when you are only bleeding a bit. 

&#x200B;

\- Ask for help and accept help. You'll need it, and your husband will need it. My family is amazing, and were SO helpful after birth, they are all complete justYES's. My husband's family was not, but that’s a long story and more suited to r/justnoMIL. For my scheduled c-section in August, I’ve already been lining up people to help, especially now that I have a toddler to care for as well. 

&#x200B;

\- And the biggest thing, don't let ANYONE shame you for needing a c-section. It's insane how so many people think that if all I did was push harder, she would have come out. I pushed hard for two fucking hours, she was firmly stuck, but if she was making slow progress I would have kept pushing. Besides, if you look into the not so distant past, maternal death rates show why we have these AMAZING AND LIFE SAVING procedures. I didn't miss out of an vaginal birth, I missed out on dying.

\- And the argument that a c-section gets in the way of bonding is complete BULLSHIT. First of all, my baby and I are incredibly bonded, having a different arrival to the world did NOT affect that at all. Second, what does that say about fathers? Adoptive parents? They don’t give birth, are you saying that if they won’t be able to bond? What about NICU parents? They often don’t get to even HOLD their children for days, are they less bonded? Fuck no. 

\- And the attitude “c-sections are the easy way out” seriously pisses me off. Trust me, if there was an easy way out, I would fucking take it, but a c-section is NOT IT. Labour is hard, but at least in my experience, recovery from a c-section is WAY harder. I couldn’t put my own shoes on for 10 DAYS. I won’t be allowed to lift my toddler for 6 weeks. Does that sound like the easy way out? Again I don’t regret my c-section, and am looking forward to skipping labour this time around, but a c-section is NOT the easy way out. 

&#x200B;

I'd love to hear from more c-section mamas, what did you wish you had known before your c-section? What were your essentials after birth? 

&#x200B;

And I'd love to hear from any FTMs or S+TMS with any questions regarding c-sections. I'll try to answer them in any way I can. ",161,113,2019-03-25,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,Had my baby after very stressful pregnancy!,"On Wednesday I was inducted at 38 weeks and had my wonderful baby Theodore at 1:12 am on Thursday, at 20"" long and 7 lbs 4 oz. 

My pregnancy was smooth sailing until around halfway through, in early-mid June I had an ob/gyn appointment and complained that I was very constipated and was starting to have pain because of it. I wasn't worried at this point and was told to take colace, which I did. About a week later I still hadn't pooped and started throwing up everything that I ate. I was taking so much colace, prune juice, fiber bisuits, tried two enemas, but nothing helped. I stopped being able to sleep because the pain was so bad. After 3 days of not holding down food I stopped being able to hold down any liquids either. I called my obgyn and was advised to go to the ER to be evaluated and get fluids. 

I went to the ER and was told the nausea and vomiting were just morning sickness (even though I hadn't had any in two months) and that constipation was normal in pregnancy, just take some colace. I was given fluids and released. The next day I was throwing up about every half hour, went back to the ER, was given more fluids and told I had hyperemisis gravidarum. I knew something was very wrong at this point but the ER doctor just brushed off all my concerns.

The next day, after being unable to hold down food for almost a week and liquids for 3 days, I started vomiting up brown smelly liquid about every 15 minutes. I knew there was nothing in my stomach and quickly google diagnosed myself as having fecal vomiting (stuff in the intestines backflowing into my stomach) and a bowel obstruction. My husband called the ob and the ob called ahead to the ER to tell them this was not normal and I needed to see a GI specialist. 

This time I was taken seriously and had an x-ray done, which showed I might have a bowel obstruction. Then a CT scan which showed I definitely had a bowel obstruction. The GI surgeon came to speak to me and told me the reason my intestines hadn't ruptured yet was because the fecal vomiting was relieving pressure on them, but the large intestine was stretched beyond repair and would need to be removed. If I didn't have surgery ASAP my intestines would end up rupturing, or dying as the blood flow was cut off in them because of the swelling. I would wake up from surgery with an ileostomy (similar to a colostomy). The anesthesia could induce labor in which case my baby at 21w6d would not survive. I'm already afraid of surgery and the surgeon had never operated on a pregnant woman before, so I was terrified heading into surgery but knew I would die without it. 

I was in surgery for 5 hours, and woke up to be told that the obstruction was caused by a large tumor. The ileostomy bag was very disheartening to me but I've since adjusted to it well enough. The cancer cells had started to spread outside the colon and onto the lymph nodes, and I would need treatment. It was the worst day of my life, it felt like my world was crashing down around me. The only good news was the baby made it through the surgery just fine. 

We didn't initially think I could do chemo during pregnancy, but after meeting with several maternal fetal medicine specialists it turns out chemo is fairly safe during pregnancy because the placenta does a pretty good job protecting the fetus. 

I completed 5 rounds of chemo during pregnancy (7 more to go) and had constant doctor's appointments to do non-stress tests and growth ultrasounds to make sure baby was doing well, all of which he did great on. My weight was a big concern since I'd been at my pre-pregnancy weight still and then lost 15 lbs during the time I wasn't eating and during hospitalization. It took me the rest of the pregnancy to gain that back. 

My doctors decided to induce me at 38 weeks to fit into my chemo schedule and make sure I didn't have to stop treatment for too long. I was eager to have my baby because I was so exhausted of dealing with late pregnancy, the chemo side effects, and working full time as well. 

So on Wednesday I went in to be induced, 16 hours after starting pitocin I delivered my beautiful baby boy. I had an epidural which was great, my first baby I went into labor on my own and it progressed so quickly I wasn't able to get an epidural and honestly thought this must feel like what dying from a gut wound feels like it was so painful. With the epidural I could still feel contractions but not pain which was great. It was very weird being basically temporarily paralyzed from the waist done though. When I was transferred from the labor to the recovery room I tried pulling myself onto the stretcher with my legs dragging behind me and my husband told me I looked like a dying animal. 

I'm not able to breastfeed because the chemo medicines/poisons transfer into the breastmilk but bottle feeding has been nice because my husband and I can take shifts at night staying up with the baby so I can actually have a decent stretch of sleep. We're so happy to have home with us after such a stressful pregnancy and he is such a cute little guy. My husband and daughter and I are all in love with him. :)

TL;DR: Had my baby Theodore after finding out halfway through pregnancy I needed my colon removed and would have an ostomy bag instead, and being diagnosed with cancer and starting chemo.",389,53,2019-10-22,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,CMV...what is it and how could you and your baby may be affected.,"First, let me state that this post is not intended to worry or scare you, but to urge you to be aware and educated. I just wish someone would have told me about the virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), before I was pregnant. This all came about during my second pregnancy. My first born was born full term with no complications.

Edit to add: I’m talking about Cytomegalovirus (CMV)

&#x200B;

After getting a gnarly cold around 17 weeks, we were so excited about our upcoming anatomy scan. We couldn't wait to find out if we were having a boy or girl, having a little boy already, we were excited to share the news with our firstborn. I had a normal pregnancy up until my anatomy scan at 20 weeks. My unborn son, yay brothers, showed signs of prominent ventricles, so we were sent to a MFM specialist for an extensive ultrasound. The specialist cleared my son, stating he didn't show any signs of ventriculomegaly. We were incredibly relieved. It was also noted that I had a single umbilical artery, which typically does not present with any issues, and most babies are born full term.

&#x200B;

Fast forward, my son was born at 37+2 due to me having high blood pressure and him falling off his growth curve. Between 32 weeks and 36 weeks he went from the 65th percentile to the 25th.  We figured it was just at the point the single umbilical artery was not keeping up with his growing needs. I was induced, baby didn't tolerate contractions, and they performed an emergency c-section. Fletcher came out 4lbs 13oz. While he was small, he was perfectly fine and needed no NICU time. We went home after 48 hours.

&#x200B;

Around 4 months old, I noticed his left eye began to wander outward. We were referred to a Pediatric ophthalmologist. She said she wasn't concerned and that we'd recheck around 14-15 months to see how things progressed on their own. Around 6 months, I noticed the lack of use and movement with his left side. He kept his little left hand in a fist, and while his leg did move, it was certainly not as active as his right. We were referred to ECI for occupational therapy. At his 9 month well-check, the doctor wasn't too keen on his progress. She scheduled an MRI to see if there was any type of neurological issue going on, and to confirm her suspicions of Cerebral Palsy.

&#x200B;

The MRI came back abnormal. Bilateral Encephalomalacia and Unilateral Polymicrogyria on the left frontal portion. Devastation, shock, disappointment. We were blindsided. We expected the Cerebral Palsy diagnosis, but not the Polymicrogyria. We upped his therapies- picked up PT twice a week, OT once a week, and Feeding Therapy for oral weakness on his left side. We were referred to a neurologist.

&#x200B;

Fletcher is 11 months old and we met with the neurologist yesterday. She believes his brain malformations were due to me contracting CMV during my second trimester. I passed the infection to him. Remember me mentioning my gnarly cold? Within those 3 weeks before my anatomy scan, CMV wreaked havoc on my son's brain. We're so fortunate he only has Spastic Hemiplegia CP on his left side. It could be so much worse. But knowing that CMV is preventable, I'm sick to my stomach that moms are left in the dark about this devastating infection. We are now scheduled for hearing observations because CMV is leading cause of hearing loss in children, other than genetic reasons. While not every child that contracts CMV will be disabled from it, it's a concern that needs to be taken seriously.

&#x200B;

What I want you to get from this:

Talk to your OB. Request Screening. If you feel severely under the weather at any point during your pregnancy, DEMAND screening. There are antivirals that can lessen the effects of the disease. Know your rights as a mother. Educate your OB,  something that presents as a cold could be so much more. Practice good hygiene during pregnancy. Do not kiss, share drinks or eating utensils with young children why you are pregnant.

&#x200B;

Here are a few statistics of congenital CMV:

1 baby every hour is severely disabled because of CMV.

Only 9% of mother's are aware of CMV.

1 in 200 children are born with CMV every year. Of that statistic, one in every five children born with Congenital CMV will develop permanent health problems with as many as 400 infant deaths annually.

In the United States, approximately one to four percent of (1-4%) of uninfected women have a Primary CMV infection during a pregnancy, and approximately 40% of women who become infected with CMV for the first time during pregnancy pass the virus to the unborn child.

Congenital CMV infection is arguably the most common PREVENTABLE cause of neonatal disability in the United States. More children are being born with disabilities due to Congenital CMV than any other well-known infections and syndromes, including Downs Syndrome, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Spina Bifida, and Pediatric HIV/AIDS.

Nearly 90% of infants born with Congenital CMV appear healthy at birth, and the vast majority will not have any visible symptoms or long term issues. Health problems or disabilities caused by Congenital CMV infection can sometimes appear roughly two or more years after birth. Infants and children who are infected with CMV after birth rarely present with symptoms and will not be exposed to any permanent problems or disabilities.

As of right now, only 86% of OB/GYNs who reported ever testing for CMV during pregnancy, did so ONLY because their patients requested a test or because a fetal anomaly was identified during ultrasound. [www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5703a2.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5703a2.htm)

&#x200B;

I hope sharing this information will help spare another mother the overwhelming disappointment, stress, and mourning that my family has experienced. We adore our Fletcher. We are working hard to give him the life he deserves. He's the most precious child, but knowing this is preventable makes it a hard pill to swallow. He was perfectly fine. He was thriving. He was ""normal"" in all sense of the word until I contracted CMV.

&#x200B;

BabyBumps,A long cautionary tale: how I managed to starve my daughter under the constant supervision of medical professionals.,"This has the potential to be a controversial post, but I'm going to share it anyway.  I'm getting closer to the halfway point with this pregnancy.  There are a lot of FTMs in this sub, and I hope that by sharing this, somebody may be able to avoid the hell we endured during our daughter's first week of life.  It should have been a joyous time.  Instead, I still find it hard to think back to those days without experiencing gut-wrenching anger, despair, and guilt at what occurred.  I plan to post this story again as we get closer to delivery.


Cora started life as the world's happiest little baby.  She almost never cried and just wanted the occasional snuggle.  I wanted to give her the absolute best of everything.  Due to this, I decided that I would attempt to exclusively breastfeed, although I was totally fine with supplementation if it was warranted.  We consulted with the lactation department on how to get her to latch.  They walked us through two or three breastfeeding sessions, providing educational materials and hands-on help with the finer points of positioning.  After observing us, they assured me that we were doing great and that she was getting plenty enough to sustain her.


But 24 hours later, she was a fussy mess that was inconsolable unless she was being held.  We fed a ton, but she'd get frustrated and break the latch to cry every 3-4 swallows.  Lactation was consulted again, and they reassured me that as long as I heard her swallowing then everything was fine.  ""Couldn't she just be swallowing her own saliva?"" I asked.  They brushed it off and instructed us to continue feeding as we had been.  They said it was 'second night syndrome,' and that all infants have a hard time about 48 hours after birth.  Once again, I did as I was told.


On day 3, her bilirubin levels were elevated and she needed to be placed on phototherapy.  This happens in babies who aren't receiving enough nutrition.  Because of this, they are unable to secrete urine and fecal matter that carries these toxins out of their little bodies.  I didn't know this at the time.  I was told it was just something that happened to 20-30% of infants.  I asked if we should give her some formula and was told no.  So I brushed it off as a random event.  After all, lactation said we were doing great.


By then she was so agitated that the concept of keeping her in a bassinet with lights was laughable.  She screamed shrilly whenever she was put down and would continue the racket for hours at a time.  At one point, her high pitched wail was a continuous stream for over 5 hours.  We spent 18 hours straight holding her on her biliblanket in our laps with the lamp above her.  She was only content when held close to our chests.  


This wasn't sitting right with me.  Alarm bells were distantly ringing in my ears, but as a first time mom, I dismissed them as paranoia.  Lactation was AGAIN called, and they instructed me to begin pumping and syringe feeding it to her.  I was getting anywhere from 1-3 ccs at a time and was completely alarmed that my volume was so low.  Again, a pat on the head and a reassurance that Cora was fine, despite the fact that she'd lost 10% of her birth weight, had only one wet diaper a day, and had dry mucus membranes...all chief signs of dehydration.  I asked when it was time to start supplementing with formula and was again told it was unnecessary.


I pumped every 2 hours around the clock, never getting more than 5 ccs of colostrum at a time.  When they rechecked her bilirubin the next morning following an exhausting night of constant pumping, nursing, and syringe feeding, it had gone UP, not down...despite a full day of phototherapy.  She wasn't producing enough waste to eliminate it from her blood.  She didn't have the adequate fluid volume to do so.  The night nurse fidgeted, as if she had something to say but was biting her tongue.  She asked me if I wanted to supplement, and I replied that we had been instructed not to up until now.  She left briefly and returned with a waiver sheet, a protocol that stated the criteria under which an infant can be allowed to be formula fed in their 'baby friendly' facility.  I signed the form.  She then told me to feed her FIVE TIMES the amount she was currently getting every 2 hours.  Instead of 5mls, I was to give her 25-30.  My face must have conveyed true horror, because she patted my arm and told me that my daughter was going to be fine.


I offered my tiny, screaming daughter a pull at the little premade bottle of Enfamil the nurse had brought me.  She fought me at first, frustrated that I was trying to get her to nurse yet again.  The moment it hit her mouth, she fell dead silent and sucked at it like she was dying.  She finished the entire 60ml bottle and screamed again when it was empty.  I tapped another.  She drank almost all of that one, too.  Altogether, she pulled down about 100mls in the span of 15 minutes.  She sighed, turned her little face into my chest, and fell asleep.


Immediately, she was back to her first day personality.  She stopped crying, stopped fidgeting, and started sleeping in her bassinet under the lights.  Her dirty and wet diapers picked up in quantity.  Her lips were full again.  


I sobbed for days.  I was beside myself with anger at the people who instructed me to starve my baby and then told me that all of the concerns I was expressing were normal newborn behavior.  I was angry at myself for following the advice of an authority figure instead of relying on my own intuition and knowledge that something was wrong.  I was guilt stricken that her first four days of life were needlessly miserable because of the breastfeeding mentality that constantly screeches ""breast is best,"" even when it's clearly not.


What should have been a two day postpartum hospitalization stretched into seven.  Cora spent another three days under lights before she was cleared for us to take her home.  I could never get comfortable with the notion of breastfeeding after that.  I *needed* to be able to measure her intake for my own mental health.  So I exclusively pumped for her instead.


She's almost two now.  This event is ancient history to her, but it's not to me.  I'll never be able to forgive myself for starving her at the instruction of somebody else.  For four days, I was trapped in my own personal Milgram experiment...only instead of a stranger screaming in pain, it was my tiny, precious daughter.


Please be wary of underfeeding.  [This](https://imgur.com/a/mrxih3E) was entirely unnecessary, and if reading this stops somebody else from going through it, then I'll be able to live with what happened.",1878,365,2019-03-29,birth weight

BabyBumps,"[Serious] How can I keep my baby a ""small/average"" birth weight? Family history and previous large baby and GD.","Hello bumpers, I am 9 weeks. I have been worried about my current pregnancy. My family history has been of large babies. Maternal Grandma ( a small, petite woman) had difficult pregnancies and nine children that were 8-9 lb babies (this is in a rural agricultural community, where she did manual labor). She told me her largest was 10 lbs. My mother followed suit with big babies and had two 8 lb, and one 9 lb child (myself). My husband was 11 lbs at birth.

&#x200B;

Forward to 2015  when we had a 10 lb 4 oz son (24 inches in length).

I had diet controlled GD. Checked my blood sugars and stayed under 130 blood sugar levels post meals (except 1 or 2 special occasions).

I gained 20 lbs that pregnancy.

Now, I'm pregnant again. I have spent the last year focusing on my health. I lost 20 lbs. I at salads, greens, lean protein, red meat on occasion. Whenever I bring up ""how do I have a small baby?"" with my provider, they kind of brush it off?

I'm 5'10 and currently 235 lbs. Husband is 6'3. We are a above average couple in size.

Recent (6 months ago) Ao1c was 5.1.

&#x200B;

I'm serious about not gaining weight this pregnancy (if possible? Can I maintain a healthy pregnancy with no weight gain considering my starting point?)

I don't want another large baby. I want to give my VBAC its best shot. Is there anyone that went through this experience or something similar?

BabyBumps,Ultrasound this week and last week show lowered birth weight...?,"So last week I had an intake with a new hospital, where we will be giving birth. They estimated the baby weight at 3.3kilos. Today, I went to old hospital bc it still said I had an appointment but technically shouldn’t have gone, anyways he did an ultrasound as well and measured the baby at 3kilos and told me to talk with hospital and set an appointment. I’m not super worried tbh (I’m 40+2) bc I know estimates are crazy but has anyone else had this? The other hospital is much more updated in terms of technology and they did a much more thorough check whereas today he did it in like 3mins or less. 

Anyways, have an appointment set up but just wanted more insight if any other moms had had this happen",2,5,2019-11-05,birth weight

BabyBumps,"""Having another one already??""","I am so broken.

Spent Christmas Eve at my families place. Thinking it would be a wonderful joyous time with to our beautiful 2 week old. 

My father came over to me, put his hand on my stomach and said ""oh, already having another one?"".

I only gave birth 2 weeks ago. I still have about 6cm to go, to get back to my natural waist, but why is it so necessary to comment on my weight? So my body didn't go back straight away, big deal, I gave birth to a human.

BabyBumps,I don't want to breastfeed.,"I don't want to breastfeed and I am sick of the ""breast is best"" shaming. This will be my second child and my second c-section. The first go, my body responded to the c-section as trauma instead of birth and my big boobs proved to be useless. They just never produced. I switched to formula fairly quick so my son would not lose weight. I figured ""fed is best"". He is now 6 and too smart for his age. So, now, I am pregnant again and have very low expectations of being able to breastfeed. 1, because I will have a scheduled c-section and have seen my bodies reaction to this before. And 2, because I simply don't want to do it. My sister successfully breastfed both of her children and kicked ass at it! More power to her and the women like her, it's awesome. For me personally, it bring feelings of anxiety and discomfort. I would rather forgo that. 

So, that is my stance. But, I keep getting push back... from the Dr.'s from certain family/friends, and I am honestly over it. My body, my choice... right? I fully intend to have the one time use premixed ready to use bottles in my go bag. I will display them in my hospital room and DARE a nurse to say boo. No, I do not want a lactation consultant. My husband is 4000% on board and ready to advocate for me in the hospital. I love that man. 

Any how, that's my rant. I was wondering if I am alone in this... or what ya'll might think about the subject.",191,249,2019-06-12,birth weight

BabyBumps,Small for gestational age on ultrasound.,"FTM here 32w0d today and I just had an ultrasound yesterday to check baby's size as I measured small at my last midwife appointment.  Overall, the ultrasound was ""reassuring"" (radiologist's words), showing that baby is in 25th percentile for growth but with a small abdomen.  I'm reviewing the ultrasound results again this morning and it shows that baby's abdominal circumference is in the <5th percentile range, which really doesn't sound that good to me.  A small amount of research this morning indicates that the low abdominal circumference can be associated with poor outcomes like preterm labor and low Apgar scores.  

So all this leaves me a little worried.  The best thing I can think to do is increase my calorie and protein intake.  Do any other low birth weight moms have some good hacks?  I'm planning to make more smoothies and also to try and eat more nutrient-dense, smaller meals throughout the day.  Advice/encouragement appreciated.

On a little more emotional note, I'm feeling guilty about all this.  I am a small person, BMI was <18 when we got pregnant although I had been trying to increase it.  During the course of this pregnancy, my husband and I sold our house, bought a new house, moved, and I also started a new job.  I think with all the other stressors I didn't focus on nutrition and supplementation as much as I could have.  I have only gained about 10 pounds so far.  My husband is extremely worried about the low birth weight results and, while he is generally a very supportive partner, his anxiety about this is making me feel even worse.  Basically, mom guilt has kicked in with a vengeance.",13,11,2019-11-21,gestational age

BabyBumps,"Low-Risk Is Not No Risk: My NIPT Experiences [TW: loss, TFMR]","ETA: Clarification - the title of my post was to illustrate that low background risk doesn’t mean you are not at risk. My odds were 1/950 before NIPT, and my baby ended up being that 1. This is a big reason why people don’t bother with the test, so I wanted to emphasize that good odds are not a guarantee for good results. 

———

So, I figured I’d make this post as I see a lot of posts asking about the NIPT/NIPS, aka cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening, whether it be about information on the tests specifically or asking advice if it’s worth it. I thought it might be helpful to share my experience and what I’ve learned as a result. I am by no means an expert or a medical professional, I’m just sharing what I know from my experiences, my genetic counselor, and my own research. With that in mind, if you have questions, I will do my best to answer them, but I may not always be able to give as detailed of an answer as you need.

&#x200B;

**TW: termination, pregnancy loss**

&#x200B;

Before we begin though, let me offer a PSA. I am a mother who has terminated a wanted pregnancy. I made it to 20 weeks with my Luca after finding out at 13 weeks that he had a 9/10 chance for a chromosomal abnormality. I felt him move and watched my body grow, even as I knew that the chances we would be bringing him home were very, very slim. I love my baby, and I miss him, and I am sad he is not here. I’ve grieved for months and may never stop grieving. He is sitting on our mantel in an urn we picked out for him. When my milk came in after my loss, I saved every drop and had it made into a little pendant that I put in his urn for him. I bought him a Jizo statue to watch over him. I bought him a star with his name on it for our Christmas tree. I talk openly about him, and I cherish the time we had with him. Every minute he was on this earth, he felt the love of his parents.

So, when people say things like, “I wouldn’t terminate because I will love my baby no matter what,” it’s incredibly hurtful, whether or not they realize it. This phrasing implies that people like me did not love our children or that we did not love them enough to keep them. I like to think that we all love our children, regardless of the choices we have to make, so it seems odd to qualify a choice not to terminate with love. It is not because my son was imperfect that we did not bring him into this world; it is because we wanted a better life for him and for his siblings. We did not want to take the chance that his case could have been one of the more severe ones. We did not want to have to put him in a home at a young age. We did not want his siblings to wonder what would happen to him after my husband and I died. Not everyone sees things that way, and that’s fine, but we believe we chose the best option for us and our family. And if not terminating is right for you, then I’m happy you’ve made a choice that works for you and your family as well.

There are many more neutral ways of phrasing your choice not to terminate that do not invalidate the decisions and experiences of TFMR parents, and I encourage you to think of some so that when you encounter this phrase, as I have dozens of times before, you can offer something with less judgement but that conveys the same sentiment. Here are a few I can think of:

* “We will continue with the pregnancy and look forward to raising this child however they come to us.”
* “We have decided to have and raise this baby, despite the difficulties that may lie ahead.”
* “We will do everything we can to make sure this baby has the best life they possibly can.”
* “We’ve decided that continuing with the pregnancy is the right decision for our family.”

&#x200B;

Now, on to the information!

&#x200B;

**What is the NIPT?**

First off, the NIPT is short for Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing. It is a regular blood draw, usually done either in your doctor’s office or at a lab. What the test does is it looks at maternal blood and looks at the fetal DNA that’s floating around in there. This test is ONLY a screening measure, and cannot tell you definitively whether or not your baby is affected by an abnormality.

&#x200B;

**When can I get it done?**

Some companies claim you can get the test done as early as 9 weeks, though most people who elect to get it done do so around 10-11 weeks. This is because if you draw blood too early, you might not have enough fetal DNA in your blood to get a reliable result. More about that below.

&#x200B;

**How much is it?**

It depends on the company, but many have financial assistance programs, at least in the US, making most tests somewhere between $200-400. Outside of the US, the tests can be significantly more expensive. However, many people who are considered high risk (over 35-40, family history, previously chromosomally abnormal pregnancy) will have the testing covered by insurance. My advice is find out what NIPT your doctor’s office uses and call the company directly with your insurance info to see how much the cost would be out of pocket and what kind of assistance programs they offer.

Anecdotally, I did Panorama with my first pregnancy and it was $349 out of pocket with the cash pay option, and $200 after they had me provide my income. With my second pregnancy, I went through MaterniT21 Plus, and they told me my cost would be $299 after I did a short survey. I still haven’t seen it go through to my insurance yet, nor have I gotten a survey, so we’ll see. I had thought maybe I’d be covered since my previous pregnancy was chromosomally abnormal, but I’m not sure yet.

&#x200B;

**I’ve heard a lot about false positives. How common is it?**

It depends on the abnormality. The more rare an abnormality is, the more likely a “positive” result can be false. For T21, false positives aren’t as common because the abnormality itself is not as rare. If you check with the company, they should be able to tell you how accurate a test is for each condition for which it screens. Just to reiterate - this is a screening test. It cannot tell you for sure if your baby is affected. To find that out, you have to do an amniocentesis or a chorionic villi sampling (CVS), each with their own timetables and risks (see more below).

&#x200B;

**I’ve read about results coming back inconclusive. What’s that about?**

While inconclusive results do happen, they are [pretty rare.](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/uog.17684) If you get the draw done too early, you might not have enough fetal DNA in your blood. Additionally, people with higher BMIs may also have lower levels of fetal DNA in their blood due to their higher blood volume. When this happens, it gets reported as low fetal fraction or insufficient fetal DNA. This can mean you will need to do a re-draw. However, in some cases, even on a re-draw at a later gestational age, you can still get inconclusive results. Oftentimes doctors will say your NIPT is high risk based on inconclusive findings that have nothing to do with what was found in the DNA, which can be very worrying. They may try additional re-draws, or they may suggest different screenings or move straight to invasive testing like the amnio or CVS.

&#x200B;

**What about the other kinds of screening I’ve heard about, like the maternal serum screens?**

These tests are more common and more often covered by insurance. They not only look at some chromosomal issues, but can also screen for neural tube defects (anencephaly, spina bifida, etc) and the risk of developing pre-eclampsia. The first trimester screen is done in conjunction with an NT scan (usually done around week 12 but no later than 13+6) to give a combined risk factor that also takes your age into account. The second trimester screen is best done between 15 and 17 weeks. However, the NIPT is generally more accurate since it looks at fetal DNA in the mother’s blood, though serum screens are still pretty reliable. [More](https://americanpregnancy.org/prenatal-testing/maternal-serum-alpha-fetoprotein-screening/) on AFP and its role in screening for abnormalities. [More](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/gynecology_obstetrics/specialty_areas/maternal_fetal_medicine/services/fetal_diagnostic_procedures/down_syndrome_screening_information.html) on the maternal serum screening done in the first and second trimesters.

&#x200B;

**I don’t have any family history. Am I still at-risk?**

Yes. Most chromosomal abnormalities occur spontaneously - only a small percentage are inherited. For example, a baby can “get” Trisomy 21 if one of the parents has what is called a balanced translocation, which means that one of their Chromosome 21’s is attached to a different chromosome than its match. A balanced translocation or being a carrier of a genetic condition does not guarantee your baby will be affected, but it does increase the odds. What exactly those odds are depends on who is the carrier.

&#x200B;

**I’m young. Doesn’t that mean my odds are really low?**

As you get older, your odds for having a child with a chromosomal abnormality increase. This is why the testing is often covered for people over 35. However, as the title of my post indicates, low risk is not no risk. That is unfortunately why I am here talking to you. My background odds at my age (27 at the time) for a baby with T21 were 1/950. My NIPT came back high-risk with a new risk result of 9/10. I proceeded to do diagnostic testing in the form of an amnio, which confirmed the positive results from the NIPT.

&#x200B;

**Won’t any abnormalities be picked up on an NT/anatomy scan?**

Maybe. Only 50%-70% of Down syndrome cases show abnormalities on an ultrasound. For T13 and 18, those numbers are higher [(90% for T13, 80% for T18)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4286865/), but there are still cases where babies look physically normal. I was told by my genetic counselor that many issues associated with microdeletions would likely show up on a scan, and it may therefore not be worth testing for them since the false positive right is higher for them. NT and anatomy scans can also show abnormalities that aren’t related to chromosomal issues, for example NTDs (neural tube defects) like anencephaly, spina bifida, as well as other organ defects. Some issues might resolve on their own, while others indicate a long-term defect. Sometimes doctors see “soft markers” for other conditions on these ultrasounds that warrant further diagnostic testing, though 11 to 17 percent of healthy babies can also show these soft markers. [Here](https://www.healthline.com/health/baby/anatomy-ultrasound#1) is a great link for what all is looked at on an anatomy scan. Considering anatomy scans are done between 18-22 weeks, this limits termination options immensely as most states have cut offs around or even before this time.

&#x200B;

**What if I get high-risk results and have to get an amnio/CVS?**

Both of these are diagnostic procedures and are typically only done after a screening test has shown elevated risk.

* A CVS is a procedure in which cells are removed from the placenta. A needle is inserted either through the cervix or through the stomach, depending on the location of the baby and the placenta. This is done only up until 13+6. The risk of miscarriage is around 1/200. This is not always recommended given that it is riskier, and with some abnormalities can be inconclusive, as sometimes only the placenta has the chromosomal abnormality, with the baby unaffected.
* An amniocentesis is a procedure in which a sample of amniotic fluid is removed from the gestational sac. A needle is inserted through the stomach; your doctor may or may not have to go through the placenta to get the fluid but should discard the first vial or two of fluid so that the fluid isn’t contaminated with placental cells. This can be performed anytime after 15/16 weeks, depending on the protocol that the office follows. The miscarriage risk is between 1/500 and 1/1000. There is a chance this procedure can “fail”, meaning the membranes cannot be pierced, which then means you have to come back at a later date to try again (this happened to me twice).

&#x200B;

**Do I really need to get any of this testing done even if I wouldn’t terminate?**

That depends. Babies with chromosomal abnormalities often need interventions immediately or shortly after birth because of physical defects. As previously mentioned, many of these issues can be seen on an anatomy scan, but not all of them.

&#x200B;

Questions you might want to ask yourself include:

* Are there any circumstances in which I/we would consider termination? (I would suggest looking up Trisomy 21, 18, and 13 and any other conditions for which your NIPT would screen. I would do that here but this is already a bit long.)
* Will the hospital I plan on going to be able to handle a special needs child?
* Do I want to have special services in place shortly after my baby is born?
* Do I want to prepare myself for a loss? (Trisomy 13/18 are most often not survivable, and if the baby does survive, they don’t live long.)

&#x200B;

Some parents want to just enjoy their pregnancies without worrying about what difficulties they might face. Some parents want to find out so they can prepare for a child with special needs. Some parents don’t want to risk getting a false positive and deal with the anxiety until getting a diagnosis, if they choose to pursue invasive testing. You get to make the choice to decide what is right for your family, and it’s not the same for everyone, so I think it’s important to educate oneself on what the NIPT screens and what you (and your partner) would do with those results.

&#x200B;

For my husband and me, we knew we would terminate. We knew that Trisomy 13/18 were usually not survivable, and if a child did survive, their life outcomes were very poor. We also knew that Trisomy 21 is not just a condition in which a child suffers intellectual disability, ranging from mild to severe, but also faces many physiological challenges, many of which may require extensive treatment and surgery. Children with T21 often have heart defects, gastrointestinal issues, an increased risk of childhood leukemia, increased risk of early onset Alzheimer’s/dementia, and so on. There’s a lot to say about why we chose what we did, but it doesn’t seem relevant to mention here.

&#x200B;

**My mom/friend/sister/aunt was told her baby was gonna have \[abnormality\] and they didn’t!**

Okay, so… I see this a lot as an argument not to get testing done. I get that people don’t want to worry, and that’s understandable. However, I would not advocate for doing/not doing something based on someone else’s anecdotal experience. 1. If it was someone who was pregnant decades ago, medicine has made a lot of progress since then. NIPT is new technology developed within the last 10 years or so, and it too has made lots of progress since it first started being used. 2. If the person was told this after a screening test, they were likely only told that some testing came back elevated and maybe they should look into getting a diagnosis. Screening is, again, NOT definitive, and false positives do happen. Having an elevated risk does not mean baby is definitely affected, it just means the odds of an issue are elevated based on biochemical markers present in the sample.

&#x200B;

**Bottom Line**

The NIPT is a screening test, **NOT** a diagnostic test. It poses no risk to you or your baby since it tests your blood, though diagnostic tests needed for confirmation do pose a small risk of miscarriage. Whatever you decide to do, it’s important to be educated about one’s options and what kind of problems can actually occur. There is no right or wrong answer, so do whatever you think is best for you and your family. Do your research and have the conversation with your partner about what you would do with increased risk results so that you know you’re on the same page.

I would, however, like to add that terminating at such a late gestation is not easy, for a variety of reasons. Besides being a grief-filled, highly emotional process, it can be a logistical headache, and there are many things people just don’t think about when it comes to the process of terminating a wanted pregnancy at later gestations. It can be a long process between the screening and getting a diagnosis, which means you might end up having to terminate later than you thought (which is what happened to me). It is hard to find clinics that do them too far in the second trimester or that aren’t booked way in advance. It’s pricier the further along you are, not to mention the fact that many states have cut-off dates, so traveling out of state is a real possibility. The procedure can also be a multi-day process, depending on laws about waiting times and how big the baby is. So, if you would consider termination, my advice is to get the NIPT done as soon as your doctor will allow, so that you can get the ball rolling on diagnostic testing and genetic counseling ASAP.

It is intended to support those receiving high risk NIPT calls and those who received low risk NIPT result but ended up with an issue anyway.

**What is an NIPT (NIPS) test?**

NIPT (NIPS) test is a screening that takes what's called cell free DNA of outer layer of placental cells (These are not actual fetal cells, but the remnants of placental debris from the first layer of placenta) and runs them through a process that looks at their chromosomes for the most common chromosomal abnormalities by two different methods called WGS (whole genome sequencing ) or SNP (measures single nucleotide polymorphisms).

NIPT tests for Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21), Edward's Syndrome (Trisomy 18), Patau Syndrome (Trisomy 13), Turner's Syndrome (Missing X chromosome) or extra X or Y chromosomes (This is very different from amnio which looks at every chromosome and is a diagnostic test vs NIPT being just a screening test).

When your baby is developing from an embryo there are several developmental stages. At the time of the NT/NIPT/CVS/AMNIO your baby has formed a placental and fetal tissue inside the placenta. In simple terms, the placenta has 2 layers with the outer layer called Cytotrophoblast layer and the inner layer called mesenchymal layer. The Cytotrophoblast  layer is the only layer connected to the blood stream and is the only layer that sheds cell free DNA into the blood stream, so the results of the NIPT are based on the cells found in the Cytotrophoblast layer ONLY. This is important to note because during the development of the embryo the Cytotrophoblast layer is the Trophectoderm layer or the Trophoblast of the embryo which is the most outer layer of the embryo during development. This layer frequently undergoes embryo correction mechanisms with errors in mitosis which can lead to abnormal cells pushed out to this layer while the inner cell mass can remain normal. This is can be quite common in younger women. The inner cell mass at the blastocyst stage is made up from the fetus and the Mesenchymal layer which later becomes the baby and the inner placental layer.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/figure\/Early-embryonic-development-from-zygote-to-blastocyst-The-cytotrophoblast-which-is\_fig1\_290598144](https://preview.redd.it/7pktfa76se641.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a60b5fbee9ac6dc8a7a2a4408cfe7bedacbdca1)

This is actually the same concept of PGS testing in IVF. As you may know, the cells taken for the PGS biopsy are cells from the trophectoderm layer which later become the outer layer of the placenta.

In about 2% of pregnancies, the placenta will have layers of abnormal chromosomes while the baby is normal (it's just most people will have a normal pregnancy and will never have their placenta tested at delivery but this has been shown in studies). In younger women, these errors usually happen during what's called mitosis - cell division after the egg and sperm are connected and dividing rapidly therefore causing some errors. These are rapidly repaired by several mechanisms in the embryonic stage called trisomy rescue, monosomy rescue, chromosomal extrusion to trophectoderm and host of other mechanisms (allocation of the aneuploidy in the trophectoderm, cell growth advantage of diploid cells in mosaic embryos, lagging of aneuploid cell division, extrusion or duplication of an aneuploid chromosome, and the abundance of DNA repair gene products. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557100](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557100)).

In older women the errors happen during what's called MEIOSIS  (first stages of the egg division before it's connected to the sperm) and are less likely to become repaired (although they can still by trisomy rescue and something called uniparental disomy). This is important for those results that are high risk in the older population and will therefore become a higher chance of a true positive since mosaicism is less likely in this scenario. The older the patient is, the more likely an abnormal result on NIPT (the outer layer of placenta) is a true positive due to the lesser ability of correction mechanisms in place due to age.

&#x200B;

*\*\*\* This is the main reason that the older the patient is the more ""accurate"" these tests get. This has nothing to do with how many tests are done and doing more tests on more younger patients will always result in more false positive cases. As the NIPT is expanding to the younger population, we will see more and more cases of ""false positives"" since before it was only offered to the older population at risk of Meiosis errors that do not self correct or abnormal sonographic findings only. Also NIPT in light of abnormal sonographic evidence aka ""high risk"" population can be a great tool as well to further gather information on true positive cases.*

[https:\/\/www.intechopen.com\/books\/placenta\/chorioangioma-of-placenta](https://preview.redd.it/0iq16g72ve641.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=71549ae5d59791f3d7b2eb971d7b15407cf34792)

For this reason, and for how common the mitosis errors are in younger patients, the outer layer of the placenta that undergoes all the correction mechanisms can lead to inaccurate results from NIPT as well as CVS testing of the outer layer. In cases of abnormal ultrasound results and positive CVS the true positive is obviously much more definitive. The longer culture is the one that grows out the Mesenchymal cells which are more closely related to the fetal cells since both came from the inner cell mass in the photo above.

So in summary: NIPT TESTS DO NOT TEST THE FETAL CELLS, but the most common scenario is that in most cases the fetal cells also match the outer placental debris layer cells. This is what happens in all ""normal"" pregnancies. Cell free DNA is Cytotrophoblast layer cells which were part of the trophectoderm layer in the embryo development. In ""abnormal"" NIPT results, the errors either self corrected to the placental layer and the fetus can be normal (which is the more likely scenario in the younger population and causes a false positive NIPT) OR the NIPT is a true positive in which case the errors did not self correct and all the layers of the placenta and the fetus are abnormal. ***The risk of a true positive is based on the age of the woman at the time of conception.*** There is also a less likely scenario of the Cytotrophoblast layer being normal in PGS, NIPT and CVS testing and the actual fetal cells being abnormal since they are all derived from different layers of embryonic development, but this is rare.

&#x200B;

**NT SCAN**  (Nuchal Translucency) CAN DETECT FETAL ABNORMALITIES INCLUDING NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS/ANENCEPHALY/omphaloceles etc which NIPT can not. So you can still have a severe abnormality with a normal NIPT TEST (This happened to me in light of a normal NIPT test and anencephaly was found on NT scan, we terminated for medical reasons for that pregnancy). \**I personally would not skip the NT scan for this reason. During this time you will also have HCG hormone and PAPP-A hormones drawn and their ratios can also give insight into placental function and increased risk for possible complications due to placental dysfunction that the NIPT can not. However, NT scan and combined triple screen is still less sensitive than NIPT for chromosomal disorders listed above. However, to me it serves a different and complimentary purpose to the NIPT test and having both is completely appropriate for this reason.*

First lets define some of these other confusing terms as related to NIPT: NIPT tests are advertised as being 99% accurate with 99% Sensitivity and 99% Specificity.

* **Sensitivity** \- the proportion of people who test positive among all those who actually have the disease.
* **Specificity** \- is the proportion of people who test negative among all those who actually do not have that disease.
* **Positive predictive value** \- the probability that following a positive test result, that individual will truly have that specific disease.
* **Negative predictive value** \- the probability that following a negative test result, that individual will truly not have that specific disease

>For any given test (i.e. sensitivity and specificity remain the same) as prevalence decreases, the PPV decreases because there will be more false positives for every true positive. This is because you’re hunting for a “needle in a haystack” and likely to find lots of other things that look similar along the way – the bigger the haystack, the more frequently you mistake things for a needle.  (aka micro deletions and any chromosomal abnormalities that are extremely rare) ([https://geekymedics.com/sensitivity-specificity-ppv-and-npv/](https://geekymedics.com/sensitivity-specificity-ppv-and-npv/) )

***ANY NIPT + result does NOT mean there is a 99% chance your baby has the disorder.*** This is determined by something called Positive Predictive Value (see above): the chance that a positive screen is truly positive. These calculators here can be used to calculate that possibility **specific to your age** since it is based on prevalence (how often you find the disease in the general population at your specific age). So for someone who is 20, the Positive Predictive Value will be much lower than for someone who is 43 since chromosomal abnormality chances increase with age.

[https://www.perinatalquality.org/Vendors/NSGC/NIPT/](https://www.perinatalquality.org/Vendors/NSGC/NIPT/)

[https://www.med.unc.edu/mfm/nips-calc/](https://www.med.unc.edu/mfm/nips-calc/)

However, the biggest problem is the lack of counseling prior to taking the test about the PPV. Anyone who receives a positive result obviously has a very real and a very scary chance of having a true positive which needs to be confirmed with diagnostic testing. Just the way it’s advertised as 99% accurate in most practices is wildly inaccurate for those who receive positive results. Genetic Counselors are notoriously frustrated by these advertised statistics when they counsel patients who receive high risk calls. NONE of these tests advertise their positive predictive value and only very few actually report them on results.

The real statistic for a ***healthy 25 year old on a positive or a high risk call for NIPT result is 50% PPV for t21, only 15% true positive for t18, only 7% true positive for t13*** which causes a lot of distress for some of the rarer chromosomes. Their advertising data always has an asterisk\* saying studies were done in high risk patients.

For a ***40 year old woman those stats are much much higher with PPV 93% for t21, 70% t18 and 50% for t13*** which is due to increase chance of Meiosis Errors that are not being repaired / do not self correct like the mitosis errors in younger women can but even in older patients t18 and t13 high risk calls can be inaccurate).

Very obviously this does not preclude young women from true positive results and it's extremely unfortunate when you're a part of that very low statistic, I have been there myself.

Every test you take lists their statistics of sensitivity and specificity which can be used to calculate the PPV and NPV; however, take this with a grain of salt. The smaller number of people tested, the more inaccurate these metrics can be since chromosomal abnormalities are still rare in a genetic population.  Therefore, these tests are most accurate for trisomy 21, and less accurate for trisomy 13, 18 and monosomy x diagnosis. Micro-deletions and any other expanded NIPT for other chromosomes will have very low positive predictive values due to very low prevalence of these diseases.

&#x200B;

***TYPES OF NIPT TESTS*** NIPT tests employ 2 different technologies which are called WGS (whole genome sequencing technology) and SNP (Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based noninvasive prenatal test). They both employ what's called cell free DNA which is debris from the outer layer of placenta called Cytotrophoblast floating around in mother's blood. The % of this debris is called % fetal fraction (which is really a misnomer because ***THESE ARE NOT FETAL CELLS AND THIS IS NOT FETAL DNA - these are placental cells)***

SNP based tests: Panorama (Natera), Harmony (Ariosa) require a 4% fetal fraction for an accurate result and therefore send out an inconclusive report in light of low fetal fraction. Their reports may say ""low fetal fraction"" and they may require a re-draw.

WGS tests: Verifi Prenatal Test (Illumina), PrenaTest (LifeCodexx/GATC Biotech AG), NIFTY Test (BGI), MaterniT21 PLUS Test (Sequenom), Bambni Assay (Berry Genomics) do not require a 4% fetal fraction and can still make a high risk call at lower fetal fractions.

&#x200B;

***AMNIO VS CVS***

Consider having an amnio done if you **have a sonographically normal pregnancy** due to the possibility of confined placental mosaicism which would show a positive CVS but a negative amnio. In light of a sonographically abnormal pregnancy, CVS should be satisfactory.

This is specifically important for monosomy X diagnosis, Trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 since placental mosaicism is very common for these chromosomes. ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1715446/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1715446/)), meaning without sonographic evidence of these trisomies the CVS COULD be wrong in combination of NIPT test.

&#x200B;

>""We advise caution when CVS is used after NIPT. The diagnostic accuracy of CVS was established mostly on the basis of studies of women of advanced maternal age who were at risk for non-mosaic aneuploidy arising from meiotic nondisjunction.4 NIPT identifies women with aneuploid cells in the placenta that have arisen from both meiotic error and mitotic error. Mitotic errors often result in mosaicism. Therefore, placental mosaicism may be much more common in women with positive NIPT results. The presence of confined placental mosaicism accounted for at least 3.6% of high-risk calls in the study by Dar et al.2 In 2 cases for which CVS appeared to confirm a high-risk call, further follow-up evaluation revealed that the fetus was actually normal. Others have reported similar findings. Therefore, we believe that, at this time, an abnormal CVS result should not be considered fully diagnostic. NIPT-positive, CVS-positive cases need confirmation through amniocentesis or ultrasound scans to prevent termination of a normal pregnancy."" ([https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(15)00589-X/fulltext](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(15)00589-X/fulltext)  
>  
>We wish to thank Dar et al for their comments, especially regarding the need for caution when using chorionic villus sampling (CVS) as follow up to abnormal noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS). We agree that amniocentesis is, indeed, the better option than CVS for follow-up evaluation to NIPS. Because the “fetal” component of the cell-free DNA that is used in NIPS is actually trophoblast in origin like chorionic villi, aneuploidy suspected by that screening method is best confirmed by cytogenetic studies on amniotic fluid cells because chorionic villi may simply be mirroring the NIPS “false positives.” Confined placental mosaicism of the types that can result in a false-positive CVS cytogenetic result occurs in approximately 0.8% of pregnancies (309/52,673 pregnancies); a fraction of those would have a sufficiently high percentage of mosaicism to result in a positive NIPS result.1 In spite of the shortcoming of CVS as a method of determining the accuracy of NIPS, part of the intent of our article was to focus on the performance of NIPS from the viewpoint of a cytogenetics laboratory. In our experience, 32% of our NIPS follow-up diagnostic samples were CVS. This suggests that many patients who have early NIPS may not want to wait until 15 weeks gestation for clarification of a positive NIPS result by amniocentesis. - Jeanne M.

***\*\*\* CAUSES OF FALSE POSITIVE NIPT TESTS \*\*\****

* Confined placental mosaicism (CPM) - This is caused by a population of cells in the placenta with three copies instead of the usual two. These cells are confined to the placenta and are not present in the baby.
* Statistical false positive result - This is an incorrect result with no apparent biological cause.
* Co-twin demise - When one twin was lost earlier in pregnancy was genetically abnormal
* Placental Rare Autosomal Trisomies in Placenta giving a false positive of the 4 ""regularly tested"" chromosomes
* Maternal chromosomal abnormalities - own mosaicism
* Maternal Cancers

Most women take the NIPT test without much afterthought, and for most people the results will be normal associated with a normal pregnancy. This is not to say people shouldn't be having an NIPT test, but so that people understand the limitations of one and that it truly is a screening test - not a diagnostic test for reasons above. It is STILL the best non invasive test that people can have for diagnosis of the above chromosomal abnormalities - it's just not always right hence a screening test. However, when the result comes back abnormal it can be extremely distressful, very sad, very confusing. You want hope, but you don't want false hope. Then you want statistics and probabilities, and you just want your doctor to tell you what's happening. And then you want a definitive answer. You want stories and  maybe you need support. Hopefully you find the above information useful with how some of these results can affect you or where they come from. For those who end up having a diagnostic testing confirming the results, I am very sorry for your struggles and any losses you may experience. I have been there and the r/ttcafterloss community was of the most help to me during those times.

I went into the ER today with brown spotting and pain in my lower right side. Gestational age according to LMP would've been 9 weeks 6 days, but baby is measuring 10 weeks 2 days, and that made me feel pretty good.

BabyBumps,Possible TW: traumatic experience after birth. Always listen to your discharge instructions and trust your gut!,"Posting to hopefully help someone else. I had a very healthy pregnancy ending in a pretty boring delivery. My blood pressure was never high, not even once. Gained 20 pounds total. I had an induction that was over in 8 hours and I only pushed a few times. I had an epidural that was amazing and I didn’t even tear this time! Everything was great and we went home after 24 hours. My nurse was very thorough with my discharge instructions and what to look for post delivery and she probably saved my life. 

A couple days after we got home I still weighed the same as when we went to the hospital to deliver and the swelling was unreal. I had this awful pain under my ribs on the right side and convinced myself I had pulled a muscle when I was pushing so hard. It would catch and I wouldn’t be able to breathe if I moved the wrong way. It was so bad I couldn’t even lay down flat or it felt like I couldn’t breathe. Finally four days after my son was born I started to really pay attention and I realized how much I had been ignoring. I was having a headache, I was having trouble breathing when I laid down, my swelling was getting worse and not better and I felt off. I took my blood pressure and it was 150/100 so we headed to the emergency room.

I ended up spending 5 days in the hospital. I had fluid on my lungs, my heart was enlarged, my blood pressure got dangerously high and I was retaining so much fluid. My diagnosis was postpartum preeclampsia even though I had had no warning signs at all prior to delivery or even immediately after. I was dangerously close to having a seizure or a stroke and if I would have stayed home that night instead of going to the ER I might not have made it. I’m still on medication for my heart and I’ve lost 25 pounds in less than two weeks of pure fluid. I was separated from my son for several nights because my risk of seizure was so high and with the Magnesium Sulfate I wasn’t allowed to get up and walk around. I had a catheter inserted three times (once because of Mag, twice to drain my bladder because I couldn’t pee after it came out). I honestly thought I was going to die a couple of times. 

I wanted to share this to hopefully caution everyone who reads it to pay attention to your body even post delivery. We all hear about things to watch for in infants and sometimes we forget that we’re also recovering from a huge bodily change. Thank god I’m ok and home now and I hope this can help someone else!

BabyBumps,Birth Story. My experience with castor oil. Jeep Birth.," I was 40 +3 and had been 4 cm dilated for 3 days as far as I knew. I had absolutely zero signs of labor coming soon other than being dilated. 
I was trying a few methods to progress things but nothing i did really made me feel any different. (I at least wanted some Braxton Hicks or something!) lol
So I read about castor oil and all the mixed experiences, I’m not afraid of a little diarrhea at this point.. I had been constipated for weeks.  For some it worked and that’s all that matters right?  
So I take a table spoon at noon. About two hours later I take another another tbsp thinking it wasn’t working because I felt nothing at all. 
6:30pm - I’m making dinner and I feel some tightening, maybe just baby moving around.. it’s not painful at all.. maybe it’s a contraction though?? 

7:30- The tightening in my abdomen actually feels kind of regular? Omg did it work!? I start timing the contractions.. still not painful at all but 5-6 mins apart.

8pm- Okay it’s a little painful, and now the castor oils reputation comes into play I feel like I need to use the bathroom. 
By 8:30 I’d been stuck in the bathroom 💩 my brains out (sorry tmi) and the contractions somehow went from 2 to 8 on the pain scale.. I feel like I’m going to pass out from pain sitting on the toilet. My body had pushed everything out. I want to shower before grandma gets here to watch our son (who is asleep in bed) and then we will go to the hospital. My water breaks as I step into the shower.. contractions getting so much worse and I know we need to leave. NOW.  Grandma is still 5 mins away when we jump in the car and race to get to the hospital.. it’s only 15 mins away. I have the window down and I’m growling through contractions.. probably looking like a crazy person to anyone who sees us and then on the freeway I feel it..  Suddenly my body tenses during a contraction and pushes, working against every fiber of my being telling it not too. Still 7 mins away.
Another contraction, it happens again.. I feel the head and come to terms with what’s about to happen next. I tell my husband that he’s coming now, he says just hold on we’re almost there while probably driving dangerously.. I couldn’t really focus on that.
2 mins away. 
I pull my yoga pants to my knees and put my heels up on the edge of the seat, I was working with limited space because I have the worlds biggest convertible car seat behind my chair. 
My body starts to push and this time I help it a little, all of a sudden I feel him in my hands and pull him up into my arms and chest. It’s surreal and I’m kind of in auto pilot. I look down at his face, he’s so purple and it’s so quiet for what feels like too long but is only a few seconds. He starts squeaking and then the squeak turns into a beautiful little cry. 
Husband is repeating “ohmygod” and looks a little pale. We turn into the ER parking lot. He runs in and comes out with two people and a wheel chair. Holding my baby I climb out and sit and get wheeled in to a room with 15 people running around and they grab him and start looking him over and doing all the things that need to be done and I get coached through delivering the placenta into a bag. 
Baby’s estimated time of birth 9:15pm.  

Edit: Forgot to mention he was 9lbs 10 oz and a perfectly healthy giant baby boy. He did have some extra bruising on his face presumably from coming out so fast or maybe facing the wrong direction, so he looked a little puffy and purple for a few days. As for me I left the hospital the next afternoon and I am healing way faster than I did with my first. Pic of my perfect little 3 day old [warrior](https://imgur.com/a/xAw7wf4) .

BabyBumps,"Felicity’s birth: elective induction at 40+1, epidural, vaginal birth. Positive birth experience followed by nightmare ICU admission for postpartum septic endometritis. Happy ending.","[Baby tax!](https://i.imgur.com/itbiO3A.jpg)

My due date was November 21. I had an uneventful, healthy pregnancy and wanted to give my body a *chance* to go into labor on its own, but had no interest in waiting much beyond that - it felt to me at a certain point like the risks just went up with little to no benefit. I ate lots of dates every day, we had sex, we went out to Indian and Thai restaurants and ordered it spicy, but at the day past my due date I was still pregnant and 1 cm, 80% effaced, -2 position, about where I had been since 38 weeks (but more effaced). I had been having some signs of early labor that week, like losing my mucus plug, bloody show, loose poops, and cramping, but nothing consistent and it never amounted to anything. 

So my husband and I showed up to the hospital for my scheduled induction at 6pm the day after my due date. They started with Cervidil, which I had hoped would do the trick, but alas, when I woke up in the morning I wasn’t in labor and hadn’t made any progress. Next was the Foley balloon. I thought this was the least likely to work, but amazingly, it did! I started having regular but very manageable contractions shortly after it was inserted at 9am. I loved looking at the monitor (I had one for the fetal heartbeat and one for my contractions) and watching them rise and fall as I felt them - I had been having these vague feelings for a week that I questioned, and found it very validating to see them objectively measured. Around noon they had tapered off, and when I told my midwife, she said, “oh! That’s a sign you’re dilated enough that it fell out!” Sure enough, the balloon pulled right out and I was 4 cm. So they started me on Pitocin. The contractions picked up again but were again very manageable. I walked around, changed positions (I liked leaning over), bounced on a ball, texted friends, and watched standup with my husband and my in-laws, who dropped by briefly. Then, around 5pm, my water broke (though one thing I didn’t realize is that your water keeps breaking and leaking throughout labor). Holy shit. After that, things got really intense. The contractions were *so* painful and I became intensely nauseous at the peak. It was all I could do to try to appreciate the time in between contractions, but even that was painful, just less so. I never thought I’d do the labor in a tub thing - I’m like a cat, I hate water - but when my midwife suggested it, it sounded good, and it actually was pretty helpful. It still hurt like hell but in the tub I could relax a little more, appreciate my husband’s presence (though not interact, really). I did that for about half an hour.

I always planned on an epidural, but my goal was to make it to 6cm before I got it but to be sure to have it before transition. I was afraid of the epidural slowing things down or stalling, and figured 6cm was definitely active labor. But after half an hour in the tub, 2 hours since my water broke and ultra-painful contractions started, I couldn’t take it anymore. I asked the midwife to check me. STILL FOUR CM - what I had been since the Foley balloon! Unbelievable. At that point I didn’t care, I just wanted the pain to stop. So I got the epidural and it was amazing. At first it was more on my left side, but rolling over on my right resolved it. It was a perfect level - I could feel my legs but they were just a little tingly, could switch positions in bed, and could even sense contractions - verified by my trusty monitor - but they just didn’t hurt. 

Interestingly enough, contrary to my fear that the epidural would slow things down, things really picked up after! I could see the contractions on the monitor becoming more and more intense and close together, and felt very grateful not to be experiencing them. My husband and I went to sleep. Close to midnight, I woke up and realized I could feel some pain from the contractions, and that it had moved location - essentially from my uterus to my butt. I also began shivering and felt like I had to poop. I knew these were signs of transition and asked the midwife to check me. Her eyes immediately got wide and she said “you are complete! 10 cm!” I had gone from 6cm to 10cm in about 2 hours - thank God I had the epidural for that. They woke up my husband and said, “ready to have a baby?” He was so excited. Unfortunately, I pushed for THREE HOURS. It was one of the most physically exhausting things I’ve ever done. I decided not to dial up the epidural, as the pain from the contractions was manageable and useful for knowing when to push. I was crowning *forever,* which my midwife said probably helped me not to tear too much. Amazingly, the fetal heart rate stayed steady and strong through all of it. Finally, at 2:51 am, Felicity was born. I immediately felt a rush of relief and joy as I felt her come out all warm and slippery and they put her on my stomach. My husband cut the cord and we did skin-to-skin, and it was such a rush. She was beautiful, big at 8 lbs 5 oz, scored a 9 on her Apgar, and was already alert, pushing herself up on my chest and holding up her head. The placenta took a long time to come out, and when it did, my midwife said it was the biggest she’d ever seen, that I could “feed triplets with it.” My husband then did skin-to-skin with Felicity while they started to sew me up (2nd degree tear, which my midwife said was pretty good considering I'm pretty small and she's a pretty sizable baby). It was exactly the birth experience I had wanted.

This is where things took a turn. I started shivering - similar to during transition, but more intense. I couldn’t stop shaking, and it was thwarting the ability of the midwife to stitch me up. They covered me with hot blankets, but nothing. They then checked my vitals. My heart rate was 150 bpm. I had a fever of 103. They drew blood, and my midwife told me, “I’ve never had to tell a patient this before, but your results show this is sepsis, and you need to go to the ICU right now.” I felt absolute terror because I know there is a high rate of death from sepsis. I mostly despaired for my husband, thinking of him dealing with all of this on his own, wanting to be with him.

Amazingly, the ICU turned me around quickly. They pumped me full of antibiotics and fluids and within two hours the biomarker for sepsis had gone from very high to almost normal. The nurses were so, so kind, held my hand and told me that I was young and healthy, that I was going to be okay, that I would be with my husband and baby soon. They arranged to bend the rules and have the baby visit me with my husband in the ICU that night. By the next morning, they discharged me to the Mom & Baby unit. The baby (with a heart-wrenching port in her tiny hand) showed all signs of health - she had not caught whatever infection I had (they guess endometritis). We were discharged on Wednesday, 3 days after the birth.

Aside from the emotional questions, the biggest challenge in the aftermath of this experience was breastfeeding. I had missed a whole day of it, during which time Felicity received donor milk, and there was a question of whether I’d be able to do it at all with the antibiotics and infection. But the doctors gave me the green light that morning and after a grueling schedule of feeding, pumping, and supplementing, my milk came in on Thanksgiving and we're on day 2 of just the boob! She's actually gained weight since birth and seems to be a super healthy, robust baby - thank God.

I am still processing what happened - it was arguably the worst day of my life on the same day as one of the best days of my life. I have never felt the prospect of death to be so close, at the worst possible time. I do think it's deepened my appreciation of the past (hard) few days, my husband and me getting to bond with our daughter together and trying to figure out this whole new world. And also for modern medicine, as well as the pretty much universally unbelievably kind humans at the hospital, and the support of our amazing friends. So that's where we are!",385,21,2019-12-01,birth experience
BabyBumps,A long cautionary tale: how I managed to starve my daughter under the constant supervision of medical professionals.,"This has the potential to be a controversial post, but I'm going to share it anyway.  I'm getting closer to the halfway point with this pregnancy.  There are a lot of FTMs in this sub, and I hope that by sharing this, somebody may be able to avoid the hell we endured during our daughter's first week of life.  It should have been a joyous time.  Instead, I still find it hard to think back to those days without experiencing gut-wrenching anger, despair, and guilt at what occurred.  I plan to post this story again as we get closer to delivery.


Cora started life as the world's happiest little baby.  She almost never cried and just wanted the occasional snuggle.  I wanted to give her the absolute best of everything.  Due to this, I decided that I would attempt to exclusively breastfeed, although I was totally fine with supplementation if it was warranted.  We consulted with the lactation department on how to get her to latch.  They walked us through two or three breastfeeding sessions, providing educational materials and hands-on help with the finer points of positioning.  After observing us, they assured me that we were doing great and that she was getting plenty enough to sustain her.


But 24 hours later, she was a fussy mess that was inconsolable unless she was being held.  We fed a ton, but she'd get frustrated and break the latch to cry every 3-4 swallows.  Lactation was consulted again, and they reassured me that as long as I heard her swallowing then everything was fine.  ""Couldn't she just be swallowing her own saliva?"" I asked.  They brushed it off and instructed us to continue feeding as we had been.  They said it was 'second night syndrome,' and that all infants have a hard time about 48 hours after birth.  Once again, I did as I was told.


On day 3, her bilirubin levels were elevated and she needed to be placed on phototherapy.  This happens in babies who aren't receiving enough nutrition.  Because of this, they are unable to secrete urine and fecal matter that carries these toxins out of their little bodies.  I didn't know this at the time.  I was told it was just something that happened to 20-30% of infants.  I asked if we should give her some formula and was told no.  So I brushed it off as a random event.  After all, lactation said we were doing great.


By then she was so agitated that the concept of keeping her in a bassinet with lights was laughable.  She screamed shrilly whenever she was put down and would continue the racket for hours at a time.  At one point, her high pitched wail was a continuous stream for over 5 hours.  We spent 18 hours straight holding her on her biliblanket in our laps with the lamp above her.  She was only content when held close to our chests.  


This wasn't sitting right with me.  Alarm bells were distantly ringing in my ears, but as a first time mom, I dismissed them as paranoia.  Lactation was AGAIN called, and they instructed me to begin pumping and syringe feeding it to her.  I was getting anywhere from 1-3 ccs at a time and was completely alarmed that my volume was so low.  Again, a pat on the head and a reassurance that Cora was fine, despite the fact that she'd lost 10% of her birth weight, had only one wet diaper a day, and had dry mucus membranes...all chief signs of dehydration.  I asked when it was time to start supplementing with formula and was again told it was unnecessary.


I pumped every 2 hours around the clock, never getting more than 5 ccs of colostrum at a time.  When they rechecked her bilirubin the next morning following an exhausting night of constant pumping, nursing, and syringe feeding, it had gone UP, not down...despite a full day of phototherapy.  She wasn't producing enough waste to eliminate it from her blood.  She didn't have the adequate fluid volume to do so.  The night nurse fidgeted, as if she had something to say but was biting her tongue.  She asked me if I wanted to supplement, and I replied that we had been instructed not to up until now.  She left briefly and returned with a waiver sheet, a protocol that stated the criteria under which an infant can be allowed to be formula fed in their 'baby friendly' facility.  I signed the form.  She then told me to feed her FIVE TIMES the amount she was currently getting every 2 hours.  Instead of 5mls, I was to give her 25-30.  My face must have conveyed true horror, because she patted my arm and told me that my daughter was going to be fine.


I offered my tiny, screaming daughter a pull at the little premade bottle of Enfamil the nurse had brought me.  She fought me at first, frustrated that I was trying to get her to nurse yet again.  The moment it hit her mouth, she fell dead silent and sucked at it like she was dying.  She finished the entire 60ml bottle and screamed again when it was empty.  I tapped another.  She drank almost all of that one, too.  Altogether, she pulled down about 100mls in the span of 15 minutes.  She sighed, turned her little face into my chest, and fell asleep.


Immediately, she was back to her first day personality.  She stopped crying, stopped fidgeting, and started sleeping in her bassinet under the lights.  Her dirty and wet diapers picked up in quantity.  Her lips were full again.  


I sobbed for days.  I was beside myself with anger at the people who instructed me to starve my baby and then told me that all of the concerns I was expressing were normal newborn behavior.  I was angry at myself for following the advice of an authority figure instead of relying on my own intuition and knowledge that something was wrong.  I was guilt stricken that her first four days of life were needlessly miserable because of the breastfeeding mentality that constantly screeches ""breast is best,"" even when it's clearly not.


What should have been a two day postpartum hospitalization stretched into seven.  Cora spent another three days under lights before she was cleared for us to take her home.  I could never get comfortable with the notion of breastfeeding after that.  I *needed* to be able to measure her intake for my own mental health.  So I exclusively pumped for her instead.


She's almost two now.  This event is ancient history to her, but it's not to me.  I'll never be able to forgive myself for starving her at the instruction of somebody else.  For four days, I was trapped in my own personal Milgram experiment...only instead of a stranger screaming in pain, it was my tiny, precious daughter.


Please be wary of underfeeding.  [This](https://imgur.com/a/mrxih3E) was entirely unnecessary, and if reading this stops somebody else from going through it, then I'll be able to live with what happened.",1875,365,2019-03-29,birth experience
BabyBumps,Traumatic Birthing Experience.,"Okay. So I have no idea where to start with this. I guess I should start with my pregnancy. I got pregnant last year, and me and my husband were ecstatic. But I had a very difficult pregnancy. I had pelvic pain that started around 8 weeks pregnant and continued up until I got induced. I got diagnosed with gestational diabetes, had to change my entire diet and then I was put on 9 units of insulin a day. And because of that, at 32 weeks pregnant, I had to go to the doctor and me and my daughter had to be monitored once a week. Then when I hit 36 weeks, I had to go 2x a week. And then I was induced at 39 weeks pregnant. When they were monitoring my blood pressure the day of my induction, they saw that it was high. They thought maybe it was nerves or something. So they tested my urine for protein, and it turns out I also had preeclampsia. And because of this, I had to be out on magnesium, which made my entire body hot and uncomfortable. I was already hooked up to so many things in my IV, the list just kept growing. They started the induction by using a foley balloon, wasn’t comfortable, but it was fine. Then when it fell out, I was dilated to 4 cm. Then they gave me a pill called cytotec to soften my cervix. Still wasn’t dilating much. Then they started me on pitocin. They told me that the magnesium and the pitocin would work against each other, and we were in for a long ride. I got some IV pain meds at some point. I still wasn’t dilating, and it had been about 12 hours in. I’m only at a 6. Doctor came in, and they had to turn my daughters head in my uterus by hand because she was facing up and she needed to be facing down. This was super painful. (I can’t remember if I had gotten an epidural yet or not) but they think they got it. And then I started dilating more and more over the course of what seemed like forever. It was over 48 hours from the start that they told me that I was at a 9. And my epidural would move to one side when I laid on my right side. So I would feel all of my contractions on my left side. And then when I laid on my left side, it fixed itself. So eventually, I started pushing at the 56 hour mark. My epidural wore off and I could feel almost everything. I pushed her out for the next 2 hours. I had to get a tiny episiotomy. And when she came out, everyone sighed a sigh of relief because it was over. But little did we know, it wasn’t over. They laid her on my chest, and the doctors were trying to get the placenta out. They took my daughter to the warmer, and my husband followed. They started to massage my uterus, but it hurt. Really really bad. It hurt worse than pushing my baby out. I asked the doctor “Why are you doing it that hard?!” 
She looked at me and said “Trust me, you want me to be doing this.”
 My mom is standing next to me looking worried as hell, which doesn’t help the fact that I’m freaking out. I then hear one of the doctors tell the other one something about me needing blood. I start freaking out, so I try to call my husband over, but I’m to weak and he can’t hear me. My father in law gets his attention, and he comes over to me. I tell him that I need blood, and he’s freaking out. 

All of a sudden, I start to get really really sleepy. I ask my husband if I can go to sleep, the nurse said yes, and my mom said no. I tried to stay awake, my husband was trying to ask me questions to keep me awake. But I passed out. Well more like blacked out because my husband says my eyes were still open. He told me I threw up multiple times (I only remember 1 time). He told me that when he would try to talk to me, I would just stare at him with this blank look on my face and in my eyes. Like I wasn’t really there. There are a few things that I remember during my black out. I remember trying to answer people when they would talk to me. It felt like I was screaming, but nothing was coming out of my mouth. I remember seeing this new person in the room that wasn’t there before. Turns out he was like the head doctor or some shit. Then I saw that doctor doing an ultrasound because they put a balloon in my uterus to stop the bleeding and then I went back under. And then I started to come to when they hooked up the blood bag to my IV. I can’t remember when, but I’m pretty sure they gave me another epidural after I gave birth. They usually take out the catheter, but they left mine in. I remember being in the most immense amount of pain I’ve ever been in. My mom had to help me shower because I could barely move. 

I know there are a lot of things that I’m leaving out, but I can’t really remember all of it. 

But because of all this, I feel so messed up. Every time I watch a show or a movie where someone is giving birth, I cry. Every single time. And it freaks me out because I can talk about what happened to me, and not cry or have flashbacks (most of the time). But when I see a labor and delivery room on TV, I get scared and I cry. My friend gave birth 2 months after me, and I was gonna go visit her, but I got scared of going back to the hospital. Every time I have my period, the blood scares me and I think something is wrong with me again. I was afraid to go home after being in the hospital because I thought I was gonna die. I’m scared to get pregnant again. 

I feel like I can’t talk about this with anyone because they’ll get annoyed and think I only want to talk about myself. I’m going to therapy, but I’m not sure if it’s working yet. 

I also just lost almost all of my friends because I just had a very bad anxiety episode, and I actually let people see what I was going through. And they all bailed. So I’m afraid to open up to anyone. My husband is deployed now. So it’s just me and my daughter most of the time. 

I don’t know why I posted this. If you read this all the way through, I appreciate you so so much.",136,38,2019-09-07,birth experience
AskDocs,"Neurological issues (I think), but all tests normal. Need help.","Hello, I’m a white 36F, 5’6” 150 lb. smoker from Atlanta, GA. I don't use drugs and only drink occasionally (maybe 1 drink a month). I have no preexisting medical condition and, on paper, I appear to be completely healthy in every respect…except that I’m not. Something is wrong, *very wrong*, but so far no doctor has been able to figure out what that something is. Granted it's only been going on for a little over a month, at this point *my whole life* is on hold and I’m *desperate* for answers.

**Some recent background history:**

**Sept 27-30th** went on a trip to Savannah, GA where I went into the ocean, got sunburned, and spent a day hiking on Cumberland Island (receiving two tick bites, which were removed within 24 hours, and several chigger bites).

Immediately following this trip I had *EXTREME* fatigue (and I’m a PhD student, I know what tired feels like, this went far and above normal tired) and started losing more hair than is usual in the shower (maybe 3X more?).

**Oct 3** went to the doctor for the fatigue and they ran a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and checked my thyroid stimulating hormone and vitamin D levels. All came back normal except my vitamin D (which was low, 16 ng/mL). I was given the flu vaccine and prescribed a 10 day course of doxycycline (sorry, I don't remember the dosage) just to be on the safe side due to the tick bites.

**Around Oct 6-10th** I had, I believe, strep throat followed by a severe sinus infection that cleared up around **Oct 15th**. Not sure if this is relevant but around this time I also kept waking up with intense soreness in my upper left calf muscle.

On **Oct 17th** was when the real problems began. While driving into school I started to not feel quite right. I felt disconnected from my body, my head felt heavy but I was lightheaded, almost like having medicine head, and I found it difficult to focus my eyes (it was like my vision was closing in on itself), there was an almost numbness running down my arms and my hands were shaking. I pulled over onto the side of the highway and ate two protein bars, figuring maybe it was just because I hadn’t eaten breakfast. My mouth was very dry and I had difficulty swallowing initially without water. The whole episode lasted around 20 minutes before I was able to continue on to school, but I felt weak and tired for hours following the incident and had a slight headache. I initially shrugged it off but then had a second episode while driving home that same day, also lasting around 20 minutes. I went to an advanced care center where they ran another complete blood count, white blood cell differential, basic metabolic panel, pregnancy test, urinalysis, and did an orthostatic blood pressure test (all normal). After a 3rd episode the next day I went to my primary care doctor who checked my B12 and B9 levels, A1C, C-peptide, random insulin, ran a comprehensive metabolic panel, and checked for Rickettsiae and B. burgdorferi antibodies (for the tick bites). Everything was normal but there was concern that perhaps it was hypoglycemia so he referred me to an endocrinologist and a cardiologist. He also prescribed a weekly vitamin D supplement (*Ergocalciferol 50,000 Unit, 8 week course, started Oct 23*). The endocrinologist ordered fasting insulin and glucose tests, checked my C-peptide, AM cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, which all came back normal. She also had me check my blood glucose levels during episodes (normal). The cardiologist ordered a 48 hour heart monitor test (results not back yet but I didn’t have an episode while wearing it) and a stress echocardiogram (normal). I was also referred to a neurologist who ordered an MRI (normal) and an EEG (test isn’t scheduled til Dec. 5th).

While still having what I call “major episodes” as described above, I’ve also been having milder, shorter ones where it’s that same disconnected, unfocused feeling in my head and almost like something is trying to shut off. Sometimes I find it difficult to find the words I’m trying to say or even to speak at all, and sometimes I’m mispronouncing words or combining them. Others I’m saying the wrong thing (not replacing the word but the sentence itself isn’t what I wanted to say). Additionally I’ve had weird sensory issues. Once while fully reclined in a recliner I got that feeling you get when you’re on a boat, that sort of wave motion which lasted until I sat back up. Another time I got a similar sort of vertigo after standing on a moving sidewalk when I stepped off that lasted around 5 minutes where I felt like I was still on it. While sitting in a dentist’s office a cold, almost numbing sensation started from the top of my head and then radiated down my body. I got up, which seemed to alleviate that feeling temporarily but when I sat back down the feeling of a major episode building began but then subsided. Last night a similar cold, yet burning tingling sensation started at my toes and radiated upward to my knees. Tapping my feet and eating some crackers seemed to help stop the sensation but I didn’t feel right in my head for hours later. While the major episodes only seem to occur while sitting, these minor episodes can happen sitting, standing, or even laying down. I'm not sure if eating something actually helps or is just me waiting out the clock, but it doesn't seem to matter whether I'm hungry or not (though it occurs more frequently when I'm hungry). It also doesn't seem to matter whether I'm smoking or not.

I’ve also been experiencing some blurry vision, memory loss, and having difficulty with my spatial orientation. While these last two may not seem like a big deal, *for me they are very telling that something is wrong*. I’m a *very* organized person, I don’t lose things, I don’t forget things, and I’m not absentminded. To the same point I have a *very* strong innate sense of direction. With regards to the speech issues they are also *extremely* out of character for me. In addition to the, what seems to me, neurological symptoms my hair is continuing to fall out excessively and I’m having frequent constipation and urgency to urinate with some pain at the end.

Though the major episodes may appear to be anxiety or panic attacks I know that **they’re not**. For starters my heart never races during an episode. I’ve also started having anxiety attacks while driving since these episodes began and there is a definite difference in the feeling I get between the two. Even more telling is that I’ve been on Klonopin (*Clonazepam 0.5 mg taken before driving, started Nov. 10*) and Prozac (*Fluoxetine 10 mg taken once per day, started Nov. 10*) during some of the episodes (Klonopin is taken VERY rarely since I’ve all but stopped driving at this point).

I currently feel quite *desperate*. If any of you reading this has any ideas or theories I’d love to hear them. Thanks in advance!

\-----

**TL;DR** \- A little over a month ago I began having frequent episodes of weakness, lightheadedness, and difficulty focusing visually. Shortly after I began having speech difficulties, sensory issues, blurry vision, memory loss, and difficulty with spatial orientation. Most ""major"" episodes all seem to happen while sitting, though ""minor"" issues have happened any time. I can't drive anymore. These are **NOT** panic attacks. All cardiology and neurology tests have come back normal. No one can figure out what's going on with me.

\-----

**Update:** For those curious, I finally got a diagnosis of conversion disorder (also known as functional neurological symptoms disorder). Basically my brain hasn't been talking to my nervous system properly. There doesn't seem to be a conclusive reason for this but most specialists think it's largely due to stress. While I am still having episodes (both major and minor) I'm hopeful that with treatment the prognosis will be good and I'll be able to return to my normal life. I very much appreciate everyone's feedback, theories, and support!",2,25,2019-11-22,stress during pregnancy

diet: thanks to my mediterranean husband who loves to cook, I eat a lot of food considered to be in the med diet- lots of olive oil, tomatoes, salads, lentils, olives, veggies, fish, chicken and turkey. When I do eat red meat (1-2 times a week?) it could be pork or beef, but usually a good quality one from a fresh market. However, let's be honest, I am still eating sweets or fried food from time to time. I drink espresso every day in the morning with 2% milk, I sometimes have a small glass of milk in the evening. I eat regular bread, cheese, etc. I haven't tried cutting any particular food groups out of my diet (no doctor has asked me about my diet.)

living in Spain (with both public and private insurance)

I am looking for advice on how I could take a more holistic approach on my health issues, and whether they are likely connected. Currently, I have visited dermatologists (3 different ones to get multiple opinions) and other general doctors for these issues, but when I seek advice on **how to treat the ROOT of the problem**, and whether anxiety is likely the root, it seems that my doctors have been reluctant to discuss anything outside of their specialty. **Can anyone suggest the type of specialist that I could visit that would take a look at my health issues more holistically?** I am hoping to find an area in medicine that would look at my diet, lifestyle, stress and anxiety management, etc. in relation to the health issues I am experiencing. I have public and private healthcare here, so I should be able to locate something, my problem is that I really don't know where to search.

Additionally, does anyone have a suggestion for an alternative to Accutane that has fewer side effects? Before this flare up happened, my husband and I were planning on starting to try to get pregnant soon. Obviously, we wouldn't be able to do that anytime soon if I follow this treatment. How is cystic acne affected by pregnancy hormones? :)

A brief explanation of my medical issues:

**Acne**: I have had acne since I was a teenager, but it became cystic in my early 20s. It shows up on my chin/jawline and cheeks only. Between the ages of 24 and 27, I have had three separate severe flare ups and was prescribed antibiotics each time by my dermatologist. During each of the 3 flare ups, I was taking antibiotics for about 3 months (yikes!) This third flare up, which I am currently still going through, has not responded much to oral antibiotics OR the same antibiotic applied in a topical tonic solution. Additionally, the third flare up seems different than the first two- I have acne in my T-zone as well and on my nose, a few on my forehead, etc. Basically all over and lots of small, hard ones in addition to several deeper cysts. Now, my dermatologist wants me to start taking Accutane, but I am worried about starting such an intense treatment.

**Bruxism/TMJ**: This is something that I have struggled with on and off since my early 20s. I grind my teeth at night during certain stressful periods. Recently, during this acne flare up, I realized that the soreness and stiffness in my jaw was not going away for several days, so I went to an otolaryngologist who advised me to take Valium 5 mg for 5 nights to relax my jaw. This helped out a lot, and for the past two months I have taken the Valium a couple of times before bed when I have tension in my jaw.

**Anxiety**: its something that runs in my family, I have never gone to a therapist about it and mostly just deal with it on my own (going to yoga, exercising, deep breathing, stretching, resting, hot bath, etc.) I sometimes feel my skin on my cheeks or neck getting hot when I notice I am getting anxious. I also feel that I am keeping tension in my body, in my jaw and hands gripping too hard on something, etc. I am an elementary teacher, so high stress job, and am living in a different country where I am still struggling to learn the language- a lot of my anxiety comes from situations where I need to speak in Spanish or times when I feel like an outsider here. Socially, if I am out with friends/coworkers who speak English, I feel much more comfortable and become much more outgoing.",3,6,2019-11-12,stress during pregnancy

Height 5'7""
Weight 250 lbs
Race white
Medication Lisinopril 20 mg, Armour Thyroid 90 mg
Light exercise, intermittent fasting 16:8, and alcohol on the weekends

So I've known I have some kind of great issue since college although I couldn't get the SVT diagnosis until my first pregnancy at age 27 when I went into the ICU at 5 months with a heart rate of 200.

After that pregnancy they tried to do an ablation but couldn't get it to do it in the OR once I wasn't pregnant anymore. 

It came back for my second pregnancy and the ablation was successful. I didn't have symptoms after that for about 2 years. But then it started coming back. I got the Hashimoto's Thyroiditis around that time too. 

Now it seems like I have symptoms of SVT seasonally. When it's cool out I don't feel it but as soon as it gets warm outside I start having good days and bad days with it and every night is just really uncomfortable. I have to sleep sitting up a lot. Sleeping on my belly on a stack of pillows helps too. 

The symptoms I mean are I guess not exactly like palpitations, more like just an irregular beat. Sometimes I feel like I can't get a deep enough breath. My head feels tight and hot. I think that might be blood pressure which spikes at night (but doesn't seem to bother me during the day).

So, is this just what my life is going to be like? Is this normal? Am I going to have a heart attack in the middle of the night?

I went to a new cardiologist about 9 months ago. He did a complete work up with stress test and holter monitor and sono and EKGs. He said there was nothing wrong with my heart. But I just dread going to sleep at night. It's so uncomfortable. This irregular heartbeat feeling and hard to breathe feeling. It makes me really anxious about dropping dead.",2,6,2019-06-06,stress during pregnancy

This was the first time we have seen her feet that swollen, and although they might have gotten a little bit bigger during her pregnancy, nothing like yesterday.

As the title says, this was overnight. We got a little worried and went to see her OBGYN. Her pressure was 120/80 which was hih for her and weird. Doctor examined her and did not find any particular reason to be worried and said to let him know if anything changes.

She took an easy rest of the day, resting a little, and working from home. Then today (Wednesday), overnight, she woke up with her feet normal again.

This is the first time during the pregnancy where she has had *something*, some type of symptom for anything.

For context, she has been somewhat stressed at work, she stayed up late on Monday to finish a presentation and did not get a good night sleep.

We decided to be cautious and she is going to take it easy for the rest of the weeks, try to lower her workload, and work from home.

* Duration of complaint: approx 3 months (first missed menstrual period was April 9)
* Location: NS, Canada and regarding female reproductive system.
* Any existing relevant medical issues: unsure if relevant - fibromyalgia, hypertension, asthma, GERD, and a history of low potassium in thr past (requiring hospitalization) and a miscarriage in 2012.
* Current medications : cymbalta (90mg), hydrochlorothiazide (25mg), lobetalol (40mg), birth control pill (marvelon generic, 21 day pack), cbd oil for pain relief, salbutemol when needed. 

My last menstrual period was March 12. As of today I am 56 days late. I'm due today, but it hasn't arrived, marking the 3rd missed period in a row. I've taken two home pregnancy tests (around the beginning of May) and both were negative. (My boyfriend and I aren't frequently sexually active, the last time we had sex was in the end of March, which would have been around that ovulation period. We used a condom and I'm on birth control pill, though I had missed a couple during the month, but I suspect that pregnancy is impossible/ruled out.) I've had exceptionally regular periods since my miscarriage in 2012.  The Tuesday following the last birth control pill of the pack, usually by noon. I've never missed a period let alone three. When I missed the first period I figured it was due to stress since it was right before finals but that stress is over now.

I do, however, seem to be getting strange bouts of nausea (they pop up randomly throughout the day) and frequent urination, including getting up during the night. The urge comes on fast and strong and if I can't urinate right away I notice I start feeling unwell (including dizziness and nausea) and often experience pain in my left flank area. This started approximately late April / early May. I've now noticed an odor and frothyness to my urine, and immediately thought UTI, so I will be headed to a walk in clinic as soon as possible. There is also a occasional pressure when urinating but no pain or burning.

The only other symptoms that seemed to appear around the same time include increased joint pain (told this is my fibromyalgia) and a pain that occurs around my midsection, about just below diaphragm level, but it is worse under my right side ribs. I also started physiotherapy at the end of March for neck pain/cervicogenic headaches that is the result of a poor desk setup at school and work (recent office admin grad). 

I see my GP at the end of June, and will probably go to a walk in this week, when I can, due to suspected UTI. But I'd thought I'd ask here as this has and continues to perplex me and is now becoming quite concerning. Thank you in advance.",2,5,2019-06-05,stress during pregnancy

50mg phenagren every 8 prn chronic nausea

Cause of chronic nausea unknown

Friday around 230am I had a stroke, it didn't show up on CT or CTA but the MRI w/contrast confirmed the stroke. The MRI also showed bilateral VAD, I was told that on both sides it starts at the base and goes about halfway their length.  Stroke affected right side - arm weakness/hard to move, foot drop and dragging leg to walk, numb/pins and needles entire right side from the midline over. As well as memory (epically failed the cognitive test they gave me) as well as word searching 

My stroke symptoms randomly get a million times worse even with lovenox and plavix then just as fast go back to the baseline have atm from the stroke. Plavix dose times were noon Friday and Saturday. Lovenox dose is 120mg. Allergic to ASA so that wasnt started - neurology said might need to bring immunology in to desensitize so can be started on it  So even with meds/treatment I'm having TIA's. I was under the impression Plavix started lowering TIA/stroke risk after about 3 hours and lovenox 4 hours with therapeutic levels being reached after 3 doses - So is it normal still symptomatic and having frequent TIA'S?

When Neurology came in I was told diagnosis and that from the scan they looked stable so approach that will be most likely is rescan in 2-3 weeks to see if healing has started and if so monitor closely that healing if not stent. No known event to trigger and neurology suspects and undiagnosed under lying condition is at the root given I'm diagnosed with POTS and Mast Cell Activation Disorder/Syndrome. Also have primary adrenal insufficiency (negative for autoimmune cause on  3 antibodies tests) and have a hx of torn ligaments two to the point reconstruction needed. Hx of saddle PE unprovoked/no known cause August 2016, AC therapy for a year then off as all hematological testing normal. Also have had a DVT cause complication of PICC line during pregnancy, PICC was for treating hyper emesis.

 How is it stable if I'm been having TIA's since the initial stroke with meds? Like so many TIA's I've lost count.

I've been low blood pressures (one I remember was 110/49 last one 108/56) and resting heart rate around 100-110 - I rest a tad high typically at 90-100 so only slightly off my norm  (once the ER got it down and I was transfer to a room I was over 200 in the ambulance). Around 11am Saturday morning it shot up to averaging 140 with jumps as high as 200 with strings of PVCs, ekg done confirming sinus tachycardia. 2 doses of an IV med to bring it down - the m beta blocker forgive me I cant remember its name keep word searching on it (and many words) and an oral dose of same med it stubbornly absolutely refused to budge any and go down. They were limited on how much of the beta blocker they could give me in fear of dropping my blood pressure. This got me transferred to Cardiac PCU around 7pm.

After 3 hours later they finally got it to a more tolerable rate in the 120s and I fell asleep about midnight. Cardiac PCU used the same med but in smaller frequent doses to achieve heart rate decreases but not cross the to much for my blood pressure and have it go even lower.

Wake up around 5 - heart racing, feels like going to jump out of my chest, rate fluctuating lightning fast between 130 to 170. Up then down then stay in the 160s then down then back up constantly big swings. Neck also hurts a TON worse then went to sleep went from 5-9 on a 0-10 scale and severe nausea. Nurses get it back down with same approach and fluids.

No one has commented on why it's so crazy high just that cardiology was called to consult.

So now I'm awake  on less then 5 hours sleep watch the monitor cause it occasionally beeps and flashes yellow/red cause even with the beta blocker it's going above their parameters sometimes. That's when I noticed it, My jump in heart rate is a direct relation to how I'm sitting/laying and the angle my shoulders and neck is at. The pain is causing major nausea.

Cardiology hasn't seen me yet just my telemetry and written orders.

To my non-medical professional self my theory on that is going on with heart rate is the amount of occlusion on both sides is significant enough to be stressing my heart leading to the tachycardia and as long as simply treated with medication therapy the tachycardia is going to remain. Neurology pulled in Neurovascular for consult. I'm worried my logic is correct and today at rounds the game plan is going to change to the stent surgery urgently vs seeing if heal on own as they said most do. I don't want to be blindsided though so would this be a logical approach to expect presented to me today? If not what are your thoughts on what's going on and what I can expect the next few days? 

I've attached the one image of my MRI I have. The neurology yesterday said that on both sides it starts at the base of my arteries around the shoulder and the dissections stop somewhere roughly around ear level/rough half the length of the arteries. The left side is the worst as its completely occluded in spots, the right side he said is pretty much that level of blockage for the length of it with two places a little wider. 
(Nevermind it won't let me put the pic I'll try in comments otherwise message me and I can send that way) The right is a small pin point of black 

With my pain worsening significantly during the night in intensity as well as how much of my neck hurts, the elevated resting heart rate, and me noticing heart rate directly impacted by certain head positions when laying down/sitting up resting head against bed what is the likelyhood in  you the responders personal opinion that I'm going to end up with a repeat MRI w/contrast to check on the status as well as chances things changed/ got larger?",5,3,2019-10-20,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Cipralex while pregnant,"I have been on Cipralex (Escitalopram) for about ten years. I was always on 15mg. When I turned 26 I got pregnant and went down to 10mg the whole pregnancy. The pregnancy went well, my son was looking great the whole time, but when I gave birth he had some fetal distress during labour and his heart stopped seconds after he was born. He was resuscitated and stayed in the NICU 2 weeks to be monitored. He also was born at 39 weeks and was 5lbs 11oz. So a bit small. He recovered very well, gained weight and is now a very smart very healthy 20 month old with no problems at all. I want to get pregnant in a few months, and over the previous 6 months I have been weaning off with my doctors help from 20mg and now I’m at 5mg. My anxiety is horrible. I have no patience and just feel awful. I had horrible PPD right after my son was born so we upped the meds to 20mg. I’ve been trying to hard to wean off because I REALLY don’t want to be on it pregnant again. But I’m not sure I can. All the doctors tell me that they don’t think the cipralex caused his traumatic birth. But I can’t stop thinking I caused it from being on SSRI medication. I’m going to talk to my doctor about it more. 
Has any doctor seen something similar happen to a baby from the mother taking SSRIs? I want to be pregnant but the stress in my life without the meds is very intolerable right now. I am down to 5mg, but think I should stay on 10mg.",1,2,2019-12-20,stress during pregnancy

Stay at home mom

My husband and I are talking about getting pregnant. 11-12 years ago I had cervical dysplasia and at first had a LEEP done and then a cone biopsy after it returned. I have had all normal paps until last year where there was an abnormality, but no cancerous cells were found. I have been reading horror stories of women losing their babies at 6-24 weeks as a result of cervical incontinence and other complications from these procedures. 

My questions are:

Are there any studies out there I can read about my situation?

How likely is it that I will miscarry? 

Does the time that's elapsed (11-12 years) have any positive effect on my chances of having a normal pregnancy?

Can I exercise/have intercourse during the pregnancy or will this weaken my cervix?

Should I consult a fetal specialist or trust my OB?

AskDocs,Non stop palpitations after exertion. Could low ferritin or a hiatial hernia cause this?,"28yo female 5’2 220lbs(working on it have lost 15 already)

Today I had a stress test due to these strong palpitations after exertion, every other beat or sometimes 5 in a row, continually for at least an hour, which have been going on almost 3 years now, with no pattern disturbance, happens like clockwork after any exertion, couple times a week. Of course they didn’t happen until I got in my car to go home. Decided to just drive next door to the ER, the doctor there didn’t even look at the monitor and just said to call my cardio. Cardio suggests beta blockers but I’d rather continue searching for the cause of this until I’ve exhausted all possibilities.

I guess my questions are these:

1. Could a hiatial hernia or stomach dislocation cause heart palpitations only from exertion? I ask this because it gets better if lay down, and comes right back if I sit up. It also gets worse if I drink or eat anything after activity. Sometimes also if I bend down not during activity I get some strong palps. I also have a history of bulimia and these attacks started after pregnancy which I gained a lot of weight, a lot.
2. I was anemic after birth, and they did start directly after birth. My iron and rbc levels were normal not long after. I never had my ferritin tested until a few weeks ago and it was 40. My saturation in April was 45% everything else normal. What chance do you think the low ferritin level is causing this?",1,2,2019-11-16,stress during pregnancy

Hi, saw this sub in r/nhs and hopefully find peace of mind or a 2nd opinion.

Started May 2018 with constant (24/7) visual disturbance of flashing white lights and streaks in both eyes,geometrical shapes+blue/red milisecond flashes as well as weekly night nasal/oral bleeds when sleeping and increased headaches when laying down/after exertion which I wake up eith at night \~1 a week. This is ongoing and is gradually worsening - 2 opticians (vision exp/specsavers) have deemed both eyes to be healthy and provided referral to opthamologist. 

At this point I left job as constant headaches were unbearable (aspirin etc didn't reduce pain). 

Saw NHS GP around May '18 who then diagnosed migraines and cycled through possible migraine treatments - propronal, co-amizclov,amitryptaline, atenolol, triptans (suma/riza) with no change in symptoms.

Visited A&E in July 2019 with numbness on left side, spirometry/ECG test taken but results not listed on discharge papers (red flag?) - neuro diagnosed migraine 'scribed Zopiclone/topirimate. After following dose 2 per day morning/eve for <1 week had intense headache 7/10 for 6 hours, felt out of character (stressed/hyper + twitching limbs), difficulty falling asleep (body would jerk at intervals - this symptom has continued). spoke with GP who stated allergic reaction so stopped.

in addition breathing has changed - shallow breaths (x-ray clear) but coughing brown mucous up for 3 weeks with blood when brushing teeth from gag reflex. 

Other - constant non moving scotomas in both visual fields (cecocentral) and pain related to eye movement. Numbness to heat in hands, burning sensations in arms and legs which is spreading. 

After doing research I believe this is due to abnormality of brain or stem (visual disturbances), forgetfullness, personality change and external talking to people who aren't there as if holding a conversation. Mucous could be bronchitis - X-ray was cleared with no concern but didn't see final copy. Also Mother took sodium Valporate during pregnancy.

A) Can this be psycosomatic/mentally induced from anxiety etc?

B) If not what tests should I push for to rule out extremes?

C) what can be done at home to slow symptoms?

Already changed Surgery as GPs have all listed as migraine however i've read the longest visual aura was 6 months without headaches. Also cognitive impairment - memory, processing are slowed and difficult than before (emotional reasoning, self awareness, sympathy). childhood memories are vague, don't remember much from before the onset of symptoms except 'snippets'. 

Most GPs have addressed this as anxiety however GP has said I shouldn't go for tests as am health anxious (results might scare me) and surgery increases risks but I know other methods than surgery and medication exist which will might help or at least have medication which will help keep symptoms down. Feel's like no one cares to look past what they don't know. may not cure but at lease ease symptoms/ bearable.

I’m healthy, I feel good, eat really well (not much sugar, rarely refined, very small amount of refined grains, etc - primarily paleo/whole foods diet), drink maybe 3-4 glasses of wine a week, exercise 6 times a week. I had a baby about a year ago (and another 4 years ago).

I’ve been dealing with weight loss resistance postpartum and have been truthfully self diagnosing hormonal imbalances and taking supplements to help them. I have been taking these for about the last couple months:

- [ ] Vitamin C - 2x 1000mg
- [ ] Stress shield blend (https://www.countrylifevitamins.com/store/stress-shield%EF%BB%BF%C2%AE)

- [ ] DIM
- [ ] Folate 

AND I take a full dropper of 1000mg CBD oil nightly, sometimes in the daytime. I believe there’s 2mg in a dropper. 

I did a metabolic and hormonal panel with my OB and it came back all normal except with liver enzymes at 60. They said the normal range is 10-40, so I’m assuming that’s my AST. 

I have a history of heavy drinking about 11 years ago. It lasted about 3 years, then I had 2 years total abstinence, along with 2 rounds 9 months of near total abstinence with the babies. I had liver enzymes tested a couple times about five years and they were at 13 and 18, so I figure my liver was fine after all that drinking. 

These days I’ll drink 3-4 glasses of wine a week on average, with three full days off each week. 

That said, starting about five years ago I can sort of “feel” my liver if i drink a bit. Like... no pain. It’s just like HEY there’s something there. Super strange. This was at the same time when I tested at very low AST levels (13 & 18).

I’m wondering what might be the cause of my elevated levels. I really try to do everything “right,” and don’t have any risk factors for fatty liver disease etc. I’m curious if the supplements might be causing strain - I’m very aware I was WAY overdoing it and have cut out everything that’s not necessary, including the CBD. 

Plot twist - I had insurance when i tested about a couple weeks ago but don’t now and won’t until maybe next month, October 1 at the latest. I was thinking of retesting with an at-home test a little later.",1,3,2019-08-16,stress during pregnancy

23F, 5’3”, 145lb, white

Apologies for any typos/editing mistakes. I’ll answer any questions as best as I can!

**Current diagnoses:** depression, anxiety (OCD), anemia

**Medications**: Prozac 20 mg, ferrous sulfate 325 mg, vitamin C pills (for iron absorption), vitamin D pills (had past deficiency), clindamycin phosphate, tretinoin 0.025%, olopatadine eye drops 

Over the past 2-3 years I’ve been dealing with a bunch of small issues that I never thought were connected, and mostly dismissed as just being stressed with school/work. I couldn’t ignore them after graduating college last year, and they’ve kind of taken over my life. 

&#x200B;

**Symptoms**

* Forehead acne: starting spring 2018, I began developing small closed comedones/clogged pores on my forehead. Have tried 5-10 OTC acne medications and they have not gone away. Went to dermatologist in January 2019 and was prescribed clindamycin + tretinoin, which has not helped after one year of use. The clogged pores do not respond to treatment or get worse with any product. They seem to get more noticeable throughout the day and less noticeable at night. They are only on my forehead.
* Weight gain: I’m most comfortable at any weight between 115-125 lbs., but the past year I have gained about 25-30 pounds that I’m having a lot of trouble losing. I began to notice it during summer 2019, when I was eating well and had a job that had me walking 7+ miles outdoors every day. I was still gaining weight. 
* Hair loss: I have lost about 1/3 of my hair since April/May 2019. It never came out in clumps, but I’ve been shedding hair all over my shower and bathroom. Friends and family have commented that my hair is thinner.
* Excessive sweating: I usually get drenched within a minute or two of stepping outside during a hot day. These are not hot flashes, but are triggered by being in warm environments, wearing heavier clothes, or drinking hot beverages/coffee. I also have trouble breathing/catching my breath outside when it is warm.
* Dry/bumpy/rough skin along back, abdomen, legs, and buttocks
* Difficulty going to sleep, difficulty waking up, fatigue throughout the day
* Random heart palpitations, usually when at rest. It feels like my heart skips a beat, and then thuds hard once or twice before returning to normal.
* Vision/eyes: I’ve always been nearsighted and worn contacts/glasses. My prescription has gotten much more severe over the past year (i.e. one eye going from -4 to -5 in three months). My ophthalmologist and optometrist are in disagreement over whether or not I have astigmatism. I can no longer wear contacts, because they feel so uncomfortable the moment I put them in. I was prescribed olopatadine eyedrops, which worked briefly but then stopped. I do not feel like my glasses prescription is ever right, no matter how many times I go back. It has also gotten much more difficult to drive at night – I always feel like I want to “turn the brightness up”, like on an iPhone.

&#x200B;

My GP took my blood in November 2019 and all came back normal except my iron levels (due to Paragard IUD, which I’ve since removed). I was prescribed 325 mg iron pills, which have helped with the heart palpitation. Nothing else really changed, so when I got my pap smear in December I brought it up with my gynecologist, and asked if I could have my hormone levels measured. She said she did not want to measure my hormone levels because “they’re always changing” as I go through my cycle, so there’s no point in finding them.

Is there anything I can do? I know some of this is definitely tied to anemia, but I feel like something else is going on as well. Should I see a different gynecologist and demand I get my hormone levels measured? I don’t want this to be the new normal. I’m 23 but feel like I’m in my 60s, I don’t look anything like myself, and I don’t feel confident in holding down a job. I just feel like so many small things in my body are out of whack to the point that I can’t really function.

I went to an urgent care and they attributed it to stress and gave me ondansetron sublinqual prn. 
A few weeks ago I started having episodes of severe burning pain in my chest, sweating, light headed and severe nausea. Sometimes, instead of the burning, I will have cramping pain in my abdomen. So far the only thing that helps is lying down for 20-30 minutes. There does not seem to be a trigger and it does not happen exclusively after eating. In fact it's usually completely random.
I work in a hospital as a student nurse and I've been having these episodes. I can't exactly go lie down so I have to power through it. Usually I can go sit and chart which helps. My nausea is getting worse and worse to the point I need to find a bathroom bc I am sure I will throw up (I usually don't, only once or twice). These symptoms are really starting to affect my life.

AskDocs,"Hormonal induced ROCD? scared for my wellbeing and happiness, and my partners also. Any help would be appreciated.","This is going to be a long one

Age: 22 sex: F Height: 5’2 weight: 145 lbs Duration: 8 weeks. Location: UK and brain lol. Existing medical issues: undiagnosed OCD for 5 years seemingly. No current medications, just take St Johns wort to try and lift low moods. 

Hello all
I wanted to make this post to get some help. I have been struggling recently the most I ever have in my life. So context, at the end of May (28th) I had a medical abortion, it was stressful of course but I knew it was right and it didn’t seem to phase me all that much. In the appointment I found the nurse white judgemental and she asked me ‘what was I doing to do in the future to stop this happening again?’ Shocked by this and her tone I said ‘I guess I’ll go on the pill’. Now I must say, I was very wary about taking the pill again as when I initially took it around age 17, I struggled severely with anxiety and it was when I first began to notice obvious symptoms of ocd ( which I believe I have been having but controlling mostly for the past 5 years). During this time i became obsessed with health (probably health ocd tbh) and i could convince myself fully that I had an ilness/ ailment, there was no logic, I purely believed these things.
Fast forward to now and two weeks back on the combined pill again and I get an intrusive thought about my relationship (I must add this is a fairly new relationship, it started in January and up until this point I felt so in love and so happy even during shit times like the abortion, we decided to move in together and I was so excited) during this relationship, health focused ocd has always been there but I could control it and push thoughts aside for the most part. But these thoughts about my relationship affected me on a whole other level. I felt a slight feeling of disconnection to my partner along this time and I cannot remember the exact wording of the thought but it was along the lines of ‘maybe you’re falling out of love with ____’ or ‘maybe you don’t love ___ like you should’. I had been SO happy and content with my partner, did not look for flaws, was just happy to start our lives together. This all came at what was supposed to be such a happy time too, as I got a new flat, a new job, left university, got the degree result I wanted. For days after this (the week of the 10th of June) I couldn’t shake these worries and became obsessive, I would ruminate over everything for HOURS everyday, his looks, his personality, little quirks and I felt a depressive fog come over me, I would cry so much and felt so so low, praying everyday that the feelings I had not even 10 days beforehand would return to my heart. Weeks have gone on and while I definitely don’t feel as far low as I was and there was times when I truly believed I was on the mend, I still feel dreadful. I believe this is rocd (relationship focused ocd) and these hours and hours over the past 6 weeks after coming off the birth control (which I did on the 14th of June) of rumination have fully scarred me, I have been so anxious at times and so numb and also depressed at others, now I feel so dreadful, all I want is my old self back, I even cry because I miss her. 
I am so scared because we have now moved in together and every night there’s crying from me because I’m feeling awful and it’s beginning to affect him too, I feel his mood down and I feel like such a bitch that I ruminate over his every move and his attractiveness and how he looks when that would never bother me before, but now I’m scared because there seems to no longer be a rush of anxiety in response to the thoughts anymore which is making me so terrified that they’re real and I truly feel this way. 
I saw a therapist but he was not specialised in cbt so I’m hoping I can get sorted with something this week but I’m in the uk and NHS waiting lists are long and London private prices are high. I’m registering with a gp this Friday to maybe discuss medication.
I really just yearn to recover and be who I was, I want the adoration for my partner and excitement for the future to come back to me. Does anyone have any ideas as to what’s happened here? Was this the result of hormone fuckery, was the drop from pregnancy hormones straight into synthetic pill ones too much? Why have I not adjusted when it’s been 7 weeks almost off birth control now (I was only on for two)? How can I be who I was it’s destroying my life? 
Some days I feel that I can do it and I can heal and we can get to where we were, others I feel hopeless that I’m destroying my life and his. Why would I lose feelings for the kindest person to ever come into my life when they were so strong before?",0,2,2019-07-31,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Constipation? 20F,"I am a 20 year old female with no medical history, no diagnoses, no disease history. I've experienced constipation off and on throughout my life since I can remember. I've never been a consistently good pooper, but I eat pretty healthy. The only medication I take is Nuvaring, which I newly started on May 6 for the first time every. Before that, from mid-March to May 5, I took Aviane. I delayed my period by starting it then. My period was due for the week of the 13th, but I am going to remove the ring for the ""off"" week tomorrow May 27 to start my placebo period. Because I have delayed my period with birth control, maybe that has a little to do with it, plus I just swapped BC to Nuvaring??

My issue is constipation, gas, and bloating. The constipation has been going on for approximately the last two weeks. However, don't think I haven't had a poo in that time! I have. They just haven't been nice, regular ones. They are short and harder than generally desired (to get down and dirty here).

So this all started about two weeks ago. I was SUPER in pain. I had not eaten anything out of the ordinary the days beforehand, nor did I have a huge meal the days before. In fact, the morning it was so bad I had not eaten anything that dat. I was stressed with finals but not the most stressed I've ever been. Anyway, the pain was so bad I thought I was having appendicitis. I had gas. I was bloated. I had stomach pain that was moving around, from lower stomach (NOT my uterus area, like definitely the stomach) to right, to left, etc. The pain would stay for thirty or so minutes and leave for an hour or so. Sometimes the pain was twisting cramps, other times more like stabbing. Moving didn't make the pain really worse or better, but I was so in pain I didn't really move. That period, the worst of this all, lasted about 24 hours. i saw my University doc about it and he said it was constipation and told me to take dulcolax. I took two Dulcolax tablets and drank two Gatorades and then had a diarrheal poo. Over the following few days I felt alright but just kind of dirty and was gassy. My gas and poo was more rank than normal.


Every few days since then I will just be bloated, especially after a meal. Now after a meal I feel like a balloon. I've experienced  this before on the occasion but damn this isn't fun.


Anyways, sometimes I will feel nauseous too. Not during mornings like morning sickness or anything. I have taken two pregnancy tests and know I'm not pregnant. My poos are not very normal, it's hard to go. So I've been taking a little Miralax every other night at the advice of my dad who is a doctor. It helps and makes me have better poos. Tonight I also took Citrucel at the suggestion of my Dad. I will see how it goes. NONE of these poos have ever been painful, but some have required some force (notably the ones without Miralax's help).

Last week I also had a poo, a non-painful one again, with a small amount of blood outside the poo. None in the poo. None on my underwear. None in any other poos. No weird meals before that, nothing super spicy. I have NOT traveled outside the country, but I was at the beach then. I told my dad (again, who is a doctor) and he suggested it was an internal hemorrhoid and told me to take the Miralax and make sure I drink enough water and am not constipated. I am not too concerned about the blood, I am more concerned about the intermittent cramping.


Can I become dependent on the Miralax and/or the Citrucel? What does all this (the gas, constipation, bloating) sound like? Should I be seriously concerned? I'm going to my University doctor this week but want to hear from others.


EDIT: To fix this, every two days or so I take about a half dose to a dose of Miralax with a glass of water. This works, but I don't know if it is good for the long term. Usually the bloating goes away after a fart, but it feels like I'm a damned balloon before that. Why am I suddenly like this?",2,2,2019-05-27,stress during pregnancy

Any existing relevant medical issues (if any) 36 weeks pregnant

Current medications (if any) Macrobid, varapamil, nexium, zoloft, prenatal 

I am 36 weeks pregnant with my 3rd child. While I am not pregnant I will sometimes experience dizzy spells and become so physically weak I can't function. I've had a couple doctor visits but no conclusion and I become frustrated and temporarily stop pursuing it. With all 3 of my pregnancies (and this has gotten worse with each one), I experience the same thing and worse. My blood pressure frequently runs low like 90s/60s even in moment of duress. I will get hot, see spots, sometimes coming close to blacking out, often vomit during these times and lose most muscle control. I feel so hot and dizzy and my heart just races. It happens after being on my feet for more than 5 minutes and I often find myself sitting on the floor at the store. I am not overexerting myself as this will happen when I've done absolutely nothing else all day. It also happens often right after I've finished eating now matter how light the meal.  It basically puts me on bed rest as I can't really do chores without it happening and try not to venture to the store even with my husband (luckily I work at home). I can't stress enough this is beyond normal pregnancy fatigue. It is incapacitating. 

&#x200B;

Side facts: I have experienced tremors in my hands since I was a child, I have been to the endocrinologist as my lab results have reflected hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and normal thyroid function. I struggle with migraines. My lab results often reflect low creatine, leukocytes and protein in my urine, borderline low Hgb, hct and Albumin. I also have asthma. All the medications I am currently on have only been prescribed while pregnant. My blood type is O- and my children's were all Rh+. I also experimented with diet changes including Keto while not pregnant (not strict, just cutting our processed foods, grains, etc) and felt significantly better.

Early in January, I was 7 months pregnant and got T-boned while driving. They hit the driver side, behind where I was sitting. My SUV wasn't drivable but was repaired. I went to hospital because I started having tons of Braxton Hicks after the accident; was released after four hours of fetal monitoring and a fetal ultrasound--baby was healthy. I did not see the accident coming, I was hit unexpectedly so didn't brace for impact or anything and felt like I got whipped back and forth.

I developed bruising under my right breast, where my seatbelt was (I assume it was from the seatbelt). It resolved. I developed much upper back and shoulder pain (in addition to the lower back pain I had from being pregnant). Did a bit of physiotherapy (four appointments I think) and one massage therapy, while trying to manage my last month before going on maternity leave. Perhaps not relevant but I was under extreme stress after the accident. I was trying to finish work so I could train my replacement, despite being in pain, was getting no sleep because of the pain (plus a toddler and I have nausea and vomiting that last my entire pregnancies). I could have gone off work, as per my doctor, but tried to keep going. Took two weeks off after attempting a day and a half and not feeling up to it. I was incredibly anxious because my first child was born prematurely & every contraction after the accident made me fearful I'd go into early labour. I was an emotional WRECK, basically. During this last bit, I had to take antibiotics twice for sinus infections that just wouldn't go away with conservative treatment.

About three weeks after the accident I started having a worsening pain on my left back/side. It felt like a really bad strained muscle and kept getting worse. I was lifting my arms to put a sweater on one morning and heard a very loud crack/pop sound and had instant, very intense pain on my left side. I couldn't move without 10/10 pain, even deep breaths caused it. I was convinced my rib had just broken.

Husband took me to the ER. Again had a normal fetal ultrasound and fetal monitoring. 

Then went back to the emergency physician. He did a chest X ray, saw nothing. Wanted to rule out pulmonary embolism, though I did not have any symptoms of one except the ""chest wall pain"". Normal EKG. Blood work was not quite normal (but he said this would be expected in pregnancy making it difficult to diagnose clots.) Then did a V/Q scan; they found four mismatched spots, but they were inconclusive. Then had a doppler of both legs; this was normal. 

Was offered a CT chest to make sure no blood clots. I said no. I did not get treated for a PE. I was given morphine and sent home. The doctor palpated my ribs and it was just one rib that was extremely painful to touch, from my sternum all the way to my back.

The pain slowly lessened over many, many weeks. But I could not lift or bend or lie on my left side without bad pain (6/10) for about two months.Couldn't drive for about three weeks, because it was too painful to turn my torso or lift my arms to the steering wheel. Had to go off work early.

I now have a healthy four-month-old. My rib still aches almost every day, after carrying either child or sitting with poor posture for extended periods. If I push (hard) on that one rib, it is still slightly sore to the touch. Still have upper back and shoulder pain that hasn't resolved since the MVA, either.

I never got an answer as to what happened to my rib. I mentioned the cracking sound to every physician I saw but no one seemed to think it was important or indicative of anything. 

Does anyone have any idea what on earth actually happened? Thanks so much.",1,1,2019-07-30,stress during pregnancy

As you can see, I spend three years striving to lose weight and in 2016 those three years of hard work was worth it, for I managed to lose weight in a healthy weight. 

Unfortunately, I have a lot of menstruation problems and my gyno had to prescribe me birth control pills to regulate my menstruation. (I wrote here before about period and gastric problems before.) I was/still is hesitant in taking them because of weight gain, but according to my doctor the pills that was sent to me had low dose and won’t cause me to gain weight still I’m kind of afraid for the things I’ve read in the Internet. I asked my doc again and told me to not worry but it depends on my body...which is not reassuring.

AskDocs,Birth control weight gain and DHEA.,"23f. 

So three years ago I went from the pill to Nexplanon arm implant. Within the year I gained 40 pounds--140 to 180; I had been very skinny my entire life, diet had not changed switching onto it. I am usually well under 2k calories a day, typically only eat two small meals or one bigger meal a day. Switched to Kylena IUD after about a year and a half on Nexplanon because of weight gain. It's been a year and a half on the IUD, diet still hasn't changed and have had a decent amount of exercise (not a whole lot because unrelated orthopedic issues) and I just cannot lose the weight I gained from Nexplanon originally. I have tried eating less and cut sugary drinks. Even had my tonsils taken out and didn't each much for a month and lost nothing.

 My boyfriend wants me to try taking DHEA, which is suppose to regulate hormones (it lowers the heightned estrogen levels from the IUD and increase testosterone) and kinda control the weight better-- it's not for weight loss, but just helps lower fat deposits and increase muscle growth. So my question is, will DHEA help with the inability to lose weight that's being held on by birth control? I don't want to go back to pill particularly. If not, what are some other options for me? 


I also hope that it helps with my sex drive, which has been non-existent for the past year (I'm on Zoloft for anxiety disorder 50mg/d)",2,1,2019-07-26,birth weight
AskDocs,I (24F) am starting to lose faith in medicine and in my intuition.,"24F, 5'1"", 130 lbs, White, USA, Birth Control. All other info below:

When I was 12, my tummy started to blow up like a balloon. I was growing at the time, and being young and not knowing any better, I just thought I was fat. For reference, I stopped growing in height at about 13. By 13 I was 5'1"" and 115 lbs, with a tummy that looked legitimately like I was 6-7 months pregnant. Very disproportionate to my body. I also had joint pain in my knees and hips after being on my feet for more than 30 minutes. Again, I thought this was normal. I literally said to myself, ""This is why there are benches everywhere.""

In the 8th grade, my periods were so irregular (bleeding 2 weeks at a time, not bleeding for 3-5 months, etc) that they put me on birth control.

Fast forward to when I'm 16, still had acne and irregular periods, and my weight was now sitting at about 120 lbs. My family goes on a ""paleo diet"" to lose weight. I join them for fun. We eat nothing but fruit, vegetables (no beans or starches), nuts (no peanuts), eggs, and meat (no fatty or processed meat, and mainly chicken) for about 1.5 months. My poofy tummy completely disappeared, and my weight dropped to 106 lbs (sounds small, but remember that I am very short). 

Eventually, I start eating like a normal human again, but I'm much more cautious about what I eat. I stay around 115 all the way through my sophomore year of college (21 years old). Seemingly out of the blue over a period of about 3 months, I put on 15 lbs and my tummy got very poofy again. I don't know if it was related, but I also had lost a certain sense of myself, I was mentally slower than I was used to, my vision went to shit, and my memory went to shit, too. I cooked almost all of my food, I walked to all of my classes. Please understand me when I say that this was not due to a change in diet or exercise. I realized that between my joints, acne, weight gain, poofy tummy, and maybe other things, this was, in fact, not normal. (Yes, I went to a doc. to rule out arthritis and autoimmune diseases.)

I did a lot of research. I learned that the gut is the center of so much of your health. It could explain my acne, fatigue, joint pain, irregular periods... etc. At a loss and frustration, over the next 3 years, I try eating every way in the book to get rid of my poofy tummy and other symptoms, hoping to shed the random 15 lbs at the same time. Low FODMAP, keto, keto without dairy, paleo again, elimination diet (adding things in slowly to find intolerance). Over a couple years, I cannot for the life of me figure out what is going on. There are too many inconsistencies. Sometimes I blow up over certain foods (maybe it's the food?), and other times I don't. 3 years of diet changes. 

After years of frustration and diligence and research and everything I can think to do, I go to a GI. The GI runs a SIBO lab (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) which comes back positive. I was not surprised, based on my research. She runs me through 3 courses of antibiotics, and my symptoms do not go anywhere. She adds GasX, too. From my research, SIBO can be a stand-alone condition from food poisoning or something, or it can be a part of a larger problem. She runs a full blood panel on me, as well as a CSID test (sugar intolerance) and a Celiac's test, but everything comes back normal. She then says to try another round of antibiotics, but at this point, I have taken 3 rounds, and I am aware of the effects it can have on the microbiome, so.... I ask if there is any other testing, imaging, lab work, or anything we can do. She tells me to try Low FODMAP diet again. This infuriates me after my 3 years of food experiments, so I go for a 2nd opinion. 

In the mean time, I made an appointment with Johns Hopkins. But they can't see me until October. (I don't have any on my computer, but I can add pictures of my tummy later when I'm on my phone.)

So, now we are caught up to yesterday. I went in for a second opinion to a new GI. After him and I discussing for about 10 minutes, he says to me, *""Sometimes you reach a point where you either have to decide to keep suppressing symptoms, or you have to deal with the hand you've been dealt.""* I. Was. Dumbfounded. He went on to say that imaging work (CT scan, MRI, etc) isn't worth my time, that medicine doesn't really know enough about the gut to help my situation, and that I should find good resources and continue to do my own research because, ""You know your body better, and with a scientific mind, you can do more for yourself than a doctor can in 20 minutes."" He was actually very kind. He listened, offered resources for research.... but the bottom line is that he admitted that there was nothing he could do for me.

Needless to say, I got in my car and was a wreck. I cried on the phone with my mom and boyfriend for 30 minutes. I've put so much time, energy, and money into figuring out what is wrong with me. Science and medicine have never failed me before. No one has ever given up on me or said that there's no answer. I feel so discouraged. 

Please, someone, anyone, advise or comment or even just sympathy. I am so frustrated and so confused. I don't know what to do other than wait until October and pray that Hopkins will have more for me.

EDIT: I apologize for coming off as short to some of you. For the most part, it's a little bit of my blunt personality. I really do appreciate the time and attention you are giving to me. It means a lot, especially now when I am feeling very lost. I'm sorry if the gratitude isn't coming off in the replies. A personal apology goes out to those who I was a bit hostile to regarding PCOS. I was previously misinformed about it and it is not right for me to come off as hostile to those who clearly know more than I do. Once again, thank you for your time and energy.

I am female, 28 years old, 165cm height, 58kg weight (sorry I only know metric). 

I have a weird question, for the past few years, I've been having these ""hallucinations"", i put them in quotations because I'm not sure if they are. Mostly when I'm feeling I'm about to fall asleep or when I've had my eyes closed for a long time or if I'm really tired, I keep seeing insects that aren't there. Mostly those big green grasshoppers or spiders, which I am kinda scared of. First thing that came to mind to me was sleep paralysis, but I was awake when this happened and actually frequently jumped out of my bed seeing the bug and francticly started looking for it.

Everytime I am 100% sure it's real, and I noticed the longer my eyes are open, the bug starts dissolving? I don't know how to put it, the transition from ""holy fuck that's a huge bug it's so close I can touch it fuck fuck fuck"" to ""where did it go?"" is seamless.

I've been googling it lately and can't find anything, but what I did read is that any form of hallucination is not normal. I don't have any history of mental illness in my family, I did have a minor head injury when I was little (fractured skull) but I haven't had any consequenses from it. The doctors all say I'm just dreaming so I don't know who to turn to. I'm not on any medication except birth control.

AskDocs,PCOS surprise pregnancy - does ultrasound already reveal a non-viable pregnancy (estimated gestational age of 5 weeks 5 days)?,"*Age - 29

*Sex - F

*Height - 5'3""

*Weight - 130 lb

*Race - white

*Location - US

I have PCOS and have not menstruated for years. Although I have ""lean"" PCOS, my androgens consistently stay in the 60-80 ng/mL range, and my ovaries look like Swiss cheese. Despite this, I recently tested positive for pregnancy (after being on metformin, 500 mg twice daily, for 3 months); I was tipped off by uterine cramping and tender breasts. 

Given my lack of menstruation, the conception date was unknowable, so the doctor ordered an ultrasound (completed the next day). Based on this image, the technician estimated I am 5 weeks and 5 days pregnant, but I don't get to see the doctor again for 2 more weeks for interpretation.

In the meantime, given my medical history, I feel anxious that I'm doomed to miscarry. My grandmother (my last living ancestor) is rapidly dying of stage 4 pancreatic cancer, and I'd love to show her this as a birthday surprise this weekend. I already know my risk of miscarriage is quite high as PCOS patient. What I'd like to know is whether or not the ultrasound already shows signs that the pregnancy is non-viable. 

For the estimated age, does the ultrasound look normal? The technician did not mention a heartbeat.

On Tuesday, I took a pregnancy at home. Test was positive. Scheduled ob appointment on Sept 10. Wednesday, I had cramping with no spotting. Thursday, I continued to cramp and went to the ER to be checked. My hcg level was 350. My ultrasound results were put as: “Possible 3 mm intrauterine gestational sac near the fundal portion of the endometrium without definite fetal pole or yolk sac. Differential possibilities would include early gestation, nonviable pregnancy versus non visualized ectopic pregnancy. Recommend continued biochemical and sonographic follow up. A small amount of free pelvic fluid may be physiologic. Heterogeneous mixed echogenicity 2.2 cm nodular structure with some peripheral blood flow in the left ovary may represent a corpus luteal cyst.”
Saturday morning, I had my hcg drawn again and the level was 434, which is about a 28% raise in around 42 hours. I’m still having back pains and slight cramping along with feeling lightheaded and winded easily. I still have not had any bleeding or cramping. Just recurrent diarrhea. I’m unsure if I should be more worried about a possible ectopic and should get checked again, or if my doctors office would have already called me if my blood levels/symptoms were warning signs to them.

Hi! So I’m currently 37 weeks pregnant. 2 previous pregnancies (live healthy full term babies, one on 24th %ile, one 38th). Both via c-section, spontaneous labour with second, both born at 38+4. Pre eclampsia with 1st (induction leading to emergency c-section). Only high blood pressure with second which did not progress. All 3 children have same father.

Blood pressure has been perfect entire pregnancy but become slightly raised over past month (usually 120s/80s when previously was 120s/70s). Baby is measuring around 40th percentile per fortnightly growth scans. Gestational diabetes this time, completely diet controlled.

Blood test results have been returning extremely high alkaline phosphatase levels but other levels are normal/borderline. No injuries or symptoms. Drs are stumped at this point as to what is causing this high level. Have to redo blood tests (most recent test yesterday returned level of 1266 u/l - I’ll try to attach a picture of the results from a few days prior if I can figure out how.

Starting to become stressful, both for my own health and for babies health - wondering if anyone has any ideas please - even of suggestions I could make for them to check?or reassurance that baby will be ok in spite of these levels! not on any medications (ferritin level slightly low but has remained unchanged since around 20weeks)

My sister was pregnant last year and during a scan at 12 weeks + 6 days of gestational period we found out that the fetus had many abnormalities like abnormal skul shape, smilobar holoprosencephaly, bilateral cleft lip and palate with polydactyly, bilateral enlarged echogenic kidneys and on performing cytogenomic microarry analysis it showed **TRISOMY OF CHROMOSOME 13 ( Patau Syndrome )**. So we had the fetus removed.

Now she is pregnant for the second time and upon scanning yesterday ( 29th June 2019) where gestational age of the fetus is 20 weeks + 1 day, we found a **Unilateral Choroid plexus cyst** without any obvious structural defects of the fetus at this period of gestation.Everything else was normal, all the body parts, heart beat and movement are normal.  


What are the complications of this? Is it directly related to Trismy 13 as there's a previous pregnancy causing that. What to do now. The doctor said the cyst might disappear after a month or so and we'll know in next scan.

AskDocs,What causes Petechiae on preterm baby?,"This is going to be long so bear with me please.
My son is 2 months old (adjusted age is 40 weeks gestation) he weighs about 9 pounds and is 20 inches long. We are in a NICU in Ohio. He was born at 30 weeks gestation and after the first 24 hours stopped having bowel movements. Whenever he was around a week old, he was diagnosed with NEC (necrotizing enterocolitis) and was treated with antibiotics. A week later, he was diagnosed with NEC again, and was treated with antibiotics again. Since then he has had few bowel movements, some of them with meconium plugs as far as four weeks into life. His stomach will randomly swell, but is still soft. Xrays show that he has air and stool in his lower intestines, but can’t pass it out on his own. Glycerin Suppositories don’t work, enemas have little success as well. We were transferred to a better hospital in hopes of answers. 
At this hospital, he had an upper and lower GI test. We found what we thought was a stricture from the NEC. This past Friday he had open surgery to remove the stricture, which to our surprise, there was none. There was scar tissue surrounding the bowels, so they removed that while informing me that there is no 100% guarantee that the scar tissue was causing the problems. 
To make things worse, about two weeks ago he started developing random Petechiae on his body. At first we thought it was strain from crying because it was on his face, but then it started appearing on his hands, arms, legs, and feet as well. It comes and goes with no real contributing factor. His blood count is normal, although he has had to have 3 blood transfusions since birth for low red blood count, but the doctors didn’t seem to think the two were related. 
I just want to know what’s wrong with my baby. The highest he’s ever been fed was 60 mls, and that only lasted a day before his stomach swelled. He’s been on TPN more often than he hasn’t.

Sex: Female
Height: 5 feet 9 inches
Weight: 190lbs
Race: White
Duration of complaint: left jaw joint was locking up due to stress in April of 2016. Had an MRI, was told I was developing arthritis. Problem went away after I got pregnant with my second child in Sept. of 2016. Left Jaw still clicks but does not lock up anymore and does not hurt. Right jaw started to lock up about three months ago, has gotten worse the past week.
Location:  right jaw joint
Existing/Relevant medical issues: OCD manifesting in picking, biting and chewing skin on the inside of my mouth, lips, fingers, cuticles and nails. Tooth I use most for biting is right top incisor. MRI of LEFT jaw joint in 2016 showed arthritis. 
Current medications: Ativan .5mg/day, Zoloft 100mg/day, singulair 10mg/day, Zyrtec. Also undergoing hormone treatments including vaginal progesterone, estradiol patches and lupron injections for the past 3-4 months to prepare for serving as a gestational carrier for a friend. Currently preparing for transfer next month so I am off all hormones/fertility meds as of Monday. 

My jaw has always clicked and popped for as long as I can remember. In April of 2016 I woke up one morning and I couldn’t open my mouth enough to fit two fingers inside of it. The left half of my face went numb. I was told it was just stress and was being made worse by my OCD which causes me to pick and chew various bits of skin on my body. I was very stressed at my job. I tried going to several doctors and specialists but no one could give me a definitive answer or help. I was in so much pain and despair I considered suicide. I told my husband and he talked me out of it. I’m thankful that he did. 

No doctor could help me. I would go to my dentist, they’d send me to my PCP. My PCP sent me to a neurologist and then back to me psychiatrist my psychiatrist put my on Valium which did not help my jaw unlock/loosen. I tried to see an oral surgeon but he said it was just due to stress and there was nothing he could do. I got pregnant in September of 2016 and that honestly saved my life. The pain went away and I am now able to fully open my mouth without pain on my left side.

Fast forward to now, where my RIGHT jaw joint is locking up in the middle of the night as I sleep. I wake up in the morning and it is locked, like the joint is “off its track” after a few minutes of moving it around it will pop back into place. I don’t want to go through this again. No doctor could help me. No doctor would give me anything for pain. I was told it was all in my head. I have two children and a husband who I love. I’m afraid of being pushed to the brink again.

I do not have the same stress in my life now as I did in April 2016. Now I work at my dream job as a behavior analyst for a public school district and I look forward to going to work each day. 

What kind of doctor or medical professional can help me? My dentist only deals with teeth. Other doctors I have gone to will either refer me back to my dentist who doesn’t know how to help me or will tell me this is stress or due to my OCD. I’m trying not to bite myself but it’s a life long habit and it’s very hard to stop.

AskDocs,[Discussion] [Cardiologists or Obstetricians] Sudden Onset Peripartum Cardiomyopathy Following First Childbirth and the Aftermath.,"I know this is long and I apologize! Thanks in advance for bearing with me!!

I had my first son at the age of 18 (pregnant at 17). Although I did gain more weight than recommended (40 lbs), pregnancy was uncomplicated and unremarkable until the very end. Prenatal care was received throughout the entire pregnancy. 

I had a routine doctors appointment on Monday morning (04/15/02) (EDD was 05/15/2002 so gestation was 35wks and some change). My blood pressure was elevated, protein was present in my urine and I had significant swelling in the lower extremities. They completed an internal exam that revealed slight dilation and effacement (as to be expected). They were suspecting preeclampsia/toxemia so I was sent home with supplies and an order to collect a 24hr urine specimen; I was to start this Tuesday morning. 

I had some contractions that evening and into the early morning hours but I ended up falling asleep (I was always told if you can fall asleep, they are not true contractions) so I was not alarmed. Upon waking in the morning, I stood up to go to the bathroom and I felt a small trickle of fluid from my vagina. This alarmed me so I called the OB. I was told to go to the hospital to be checked out for PROM. 

Triage told me that I just “peed my pants” and tried to send me home. I was adamant that I did not and refused to leave until a OB/Midwife from my practice confirmed under microscope (I continued to have these small trickles of fluid intermittently). My OB confirmed it was indeed amniotic fluid and I was admitted to start inducing labor via Pitocin. 

I was taken for an US to determine baby’s approx weight, informed of risks associated with preterm labor, administered Pitocin and started on IV fluids. 
I labored all day and into the night. I requested an epidural that took for roughly 1.5 hours and then wore off. The nurse paged the ANES on call and he said (this is according to my extremely infuriated L&D Nurse) “he is not coming unless it is a life or death emergency”. She was very understanding and empathetic, even urging me to call and complain about this. So, 0800 another ANES is on call and comes to re-do my epidural. I was so very thankful but in hindsight it was too much and too late. I started pushing around 0840 and could not feel ANYTHING!! I literally slept b/w contractions/pushing and had to be awoken by my nurse to say “it’s time to push”. I’d push and then fall back asleep. 

I finally delivered my healthy baby boy at 1009. I LITERALLY had to take each hand, one above and one below, to open my eyes manually to see my sweet baby boy!! I remember doing so and saying “who does he look like?” 

Things were routine and unremarkable following my delivery until that evening when trying to settle in for some much needed rest. I kept trying to get comfortable and couldn’t; I had this annoying rustle/rattle/gurgle (hard to explain) in my chest/throat every time I would inhale. I am not sure if I honestly was struggling to breathe or if it was creating a panic attack, but I eventually called the nurse in. My BP was substantially high and SpO2 was 76%. 

Imagining machines were brought into my room and dx was congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. I was sent to ICU and stayed there for 2 weeks. I had been asking to use the restroom before there was even a dx. I was put off and put off. Finally after about 45 min in ICU, I demanded that I had to void my bladder. I was not allowed to get up so two nurses helped me by putting a bed pan under my buttocks. I filled up a whole bed pan and 3/4 of another. That was before I was even administered Lasix. The following day, the nurse was weighing me (the bed was designed to do so w/o my getting up). I was curious to know how much weight I had lost with just the delivery of my baby and the accompanying tissue and fluids involved. She told me that I weighed 171lbs.  This was a complete shock to me because at my routine appointment that Monday I had weighed 154lbs. She said she could re-weigh me because I had a pillow from home and the bed was not calibrated for the additional pillow. I don’t think that one pillow weighed what I wanted it to weigh LoL. 

I was discharged from the hospital after 2 weeks. I followed up with a Cardiologist for 1 year. I was told that there was no lasting damage to my heart muscle but I did have mild pulmonary hypertension(MPH). 

It wasn’t until weeks later that I got pictures from my labor and delivery developed that I started putting things together. I have pictures of me throughout the process and then (the main one that I compare) one of my son’s Father and I holding our baby for the first time. My face looks like the Michelin Man on steroids. If, you weren’t able to see the rest of my body, you would think that I weighed 500lbs. just by how my face looks. 

I started researching and asking questions. I have learned that I should’ve never been put on fluids. Even though I did not have a confirmed diagnosis, it was definitely suspected. I believe that this could have all been prevented had they followed protocol for a woman with preeclampsia. 

In my subsequent pregnancies I have been HR and have many coordinating specialists. But it wasn’t until my 3rd pregnancy that there was no longer any evidence of MPH. The same followed with my 4th and final pregnancy. 

Fast forward to now, my BP has been rather high (ie. 167/118, 140/111, 151/110). Pulse is almost always elevated as well. My AppleWatch shows resting HR to be in the high normal and it’s normally 110-120 but has been as high as 165. 

Friday morning (0230) I woke up and grabbed some h20 and laid back down. There was this random, intermittent pain (hard to describe) that I continued to feel. It would almost take my breath away. It lasted into the following day. It is occurring significantly less now but it still comes and goes. 

I am Female, Caucasian, 5’2”, 140lbs., LOC: Heart, Duration: at least 4 months but probably longer, Frequent Recurring Kidney Infections, Hypothyroidism (currently untreated), Depression

Medications: Bupropion 150mg qd (although I’m supposed to take at bedtime but it keeps me awake), Vyvanse 50mg qd, and Suboxone 0.5mg (been tapering and just started 0.5mg from 1.0mg 2 days ago). 

Do you believe this is a consequence of my cardiomyopathy or something new is warranting these symptoms. Could tapering from Suboxone cause an influx in HR and BP?

It’s completely unexplained and doesn’t seem to be a symptom of any other medical condition. Other than aesthetics, it doesn’t affect my day-to-day life.

I got pregnant in May, I’m now 36 weeks along. I literally haven’t had one bruise since I became pregnant. I’m mainly just posting because of curiosity. I don’t think prenatal vitamins are the reason because I had been taking those for awhile before pregnancy. My last CBC was at 27 weeks and everything was still within normal range. I also am considered low risk-no gestational diabetes, normal blood pressure, no swelling. Other than morning sickness and minor back aches and fatigue in the third trimester, I’ve had an easy pregnancy compared to some. I’m RH negative.

Current meds: AltaVera, Bentyl (prescribed 4x per day but I take as needed), Xanax ( .5-1mg as needed)

I went to a walk-in clinic on Friday for a routine physical for work. They did a urine sample, which revealed trace amounts of ketones and protein in my urine. I had Gestational Diabetes, so this concerns me that it could be an early sign of Type 2. I hadn’t eaten or drank much during the day because I had been very busy all day. The doctor asked me if I was on a low carb, high protein diet—which I am not. I still have some of my testing supplies so I decided to test 2 hours after dinner (40 grams carbs, 16 grams protein). My number was 97, so well within range. 

Then, they did a chest X-ray instead of the skin prick for a TB test so that I wouldn’t have to come back in 2 days. The doctor came in and said my heart was enlarged on the X-ray. Two years ago, a heart murmur was discovered while I was going through a miscarriage. I went in for an echocardiogram, and they said I had mild regurgitation in the atrial and mitral valves (if I remember correctly). But they said it didn’t require any follow-up and hasn’t been mentioned since. The doctor I saw on Friday said to watch my diet and exercise and that it could wait 6 months but that I should follow-up with my PCP. My blood pressure was 134/88 but I was also very stressed because I was dealing with insurance issues all day and my daughter was also sick. When I saw my PCP 2 weeks ago, they said my blood pressure was great. 

So I have two questions:
1. Is it possible that the ketones and protein were just dehydration? Or is it more likely to potentially be diabetes?
2. How urgently should I see my PCP for follow-up? Is cardiomegaly really something that can wait 6 months?

I’m 14 weeks today. For the past 3-4 hours, I have been having what feels like distinct Braxton Hicks. They’ve been knocking the wind out of me. No other symptoms. Just what feels like tightening in my uterus. It has been making me a bit nauseous, and if I lift anything more than 10ish pounds or so it hurts in my pelvic area. I have not done anything strenuous to bring this on. Belly feels hard when they happen. 

This is my 4th pregnancy and all of these feels normal for me, but what is making me concerned is how far along I am. I typically don’t feel these symptoms until baby is much bigger and I’m further along, usually around 24-28 weeks. 

3 previous pregnancies, no miscarriages, all live births. Earliest came at 37 weeks and 3 days so no real history of preterm labor. History of anemia in pregnancy. Doctor has had no concerns about my weight. No history of gestational diabetes, however there is a family history of diabetes.

Previous health issues: gestational hypertension (first child)
Symptoms: blood in urine, dull lower back/flank pain, period has not yet returned after IUD removal on December 10th

Hello, I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on the slew of random issues that showed up on a CT scan I recently had. First and foremost, I went and got a physical back in November with full blood and urine samples taken. Blood was all normal, but I had microscopic blood in my urine. My Dr thought it was gynecological from my Mirena IUD I had, but scheduled me to give another sample in 2 weeks. Well, that one also had blood and I ended up having my Mirena removed (husband had vasectomy) and retested for a third time. Blood again.

My Dr still thinks it’s nothing, but schedules a CT. Around the time of the second urine sample given I had some right lower back/flank pain come and go, which I assume was my kidney. I went into the CT thinking stones were the culprit.

He calls me with my results yesterday and here were the findings. I don’t have a copy of the findings unfortunately, so I am reporting on what I can remember:

- Diverticuli (which he said I was young for and asked if I had problems with constipation. I wouldn’t say I have bad bouts of it, but I’m not the most regular person and can skip a day a couple times a week)
- Polyp in my stomach (he didn’t mention where in my stomach. I don’t have any symptoms of pain other than occasional indigestion)
- Mass near my ovary/uterus on right side (he didn’t mention how big and said that wasn’t on the report and he asked if I had fibroids in the past. I told him not that I know of. It did not state in the report if it originated on the ovary or uterus, they couldn’t tell)
- No definite cause for blood in urine

Next steps are he is scheduling me with a urologist who will probably do a repeat CT with contrast since they couldn’t see in my bladder with last CT. I pushed to go ahead and get a referral for an ultrasound for my ovary/uterus thing because ovarian cancer terrifies me.

Which would you be most concerned with in these results? Could my lack of period be related to my ovary/uterus thing? I am definitely going to follow up on everything but I’m scared because they seem to all be in different places in my body that I won’t prioritize the correct issue. I am overall a healthy person and I feel like my body is betraying me. :(

Thank you in advance. ",3,1,2019-01-16,gestational age
AskDocs,I (24F) am starting to lose faith in medicine and in my intuition.,"24F, 5'1"", 130 lbs, White, USA, Birth Control. All other info below:

When I was 12, my tummy started to blow up like a balloon. I was growing at the time, and being young and not knowing any better, I just thought I was fat. For reference, I stopped growing in height at about 13. By 13 I was 5'1"" and 115 lbs, with a tummy that looked legitimately like I was 6-7 months pregnant. Very disproportionate to my body. I also had joint pain in my knees and hips after being on my feet for more than 30 minutes. Again, I thought this was normal. I literally said to myself, ""This is why there are benches everywhere.""

In the 8th grade, my periods were so irregular (bleeding 2 weeks at a time, not bleeding for 3-5 months, etc) that they put me on birth control.

Fast forward to when I'm 16, still had acne and irregular periods, and my weight was now sitting at about 120 lbs. My family goes on a ""paleo diet"" to lose weight. I join them for fun. We eat nothing but fruit, vegetables (no beans or starches), nuts (no peanuts), eggs, and meat (no fatty or processed meat, and mainly chicken) for about 1.5 months. My poofy tummy completely disappeared, and my weight dropped to 106 lbs (sounds small, but remember that I am very short). 

Eventually, I start eating like a normal human again, but I'm much more cautious about what I eat. I stay around 115 all the way through my sophomore year of college (21 years old). Seemingly out of the blue over a period of about 3 months, I put on 15 lbs and my tummy got very poofy again. I don't know if it was related, but I also had lost a certain sense of myself, I was mentally slower than I was used to, my vision went to shit, and my memory went to shit, too. I cooked almost all of my food, I walked to all of my classes. Please understand me when I say that this was not due to a change in diet or exercise. I realized that between my joints, acne, weight gain, poofy tummy, and maybe other things, this was, in fact, not normal. (Yes, I went to a doc. to rule out arthritis and autoimmune diseases.)

I did a lot of research. I learned that the gut is the center of so much of your health. It could explain my acne, fatigue, joint pain, irregular periods... etc. At a loss and frustration, over the next 3 years, I try eating every way in the book to get rid of my poofy tummy and other symptoms, hoping to shed the random 15 lbs at the same time. Low FODMAP, keto, keto without dairy, paleo again, elimination diet (adding things in slowly to find intolerance). Over a couple years, I cannot for the life of me figure out what is going on. There are too many inconsistencies. Sometimes I blow up over certain foods (maybe it's the food?), and other times I don't. 3 years of diet changes. 

After years of frustration and diligence and research and everything I can think to do, I go to a GI. The GI runs a SIBO lab (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) which comes back positive. I was not surprised, based on my research. She runs me through 3 courses of antibiotics, and my symptoms do not go anywhere. She adds GasX, too. From my research, SIBO can be a stand-alone condition from food poisoning or something, or it can be a part of a larger problem. She runs a full blood panel on me, as well as a CSID test (sugar intolerance) and a Celiac's test, but everything comes back normal. She then says to try another round of antibiotics, but at this point, I have taken 3 rounds, and I am aware of the effects it can have on the microbiome, so.... I ask if there is any other testing, imaging, lab work, or anything we can do. She tells me to try Low FODMAP diet again. This infuriates me after my 3 years of food experiments, so I go for a 2nd opinion. 

In the mean time, I made an appointment with Johns Hopkins. But they can't see me until October. (I don't have any on my computer, but I can add pictures of my tummy later when I'm on my phone.)

So, now we are caught up to yesterday. I went in for a second opinion to a new GI. After him and I discussing for about 10 minutes, he says to me, *""Sometimes you reach a point where you either have to decide to keep suppressing symptoms, or you have to deal with the hand you've been dealt.""* I. Was. Dumbfounded. He went on to say that imaging work (CT scan, MRI, etc) isn't worth my time, that medicine doesn't really know enough about the gut to help my situation, and that I should find good resources and continue to do my own research because, ""You know your body better, and with a scientific mind, you can do more for yourself than a doctor can in 20 minutes."" He was actually very kind. He listened, offered resources for research.... but the bottom line is that he admitted that there was nothing he could do for me.

Needless to say, I got in my car and was a wreck. I cried on the phone with my mom and boyfriend for 30 minutes. I've put so much time, energy, and money into figuring out what is wrong with me. Science and medicine have never failed me before. No one has ever given up on me or said that there's no answer. I feel so discouraged. 

Please, someone, anyone, advise or comment or even just sympathy. I am so frustrated and so confused. I don't know what to do other than wait until October and pray that Hopkins will have more for me.

EDIT: I apologize for coming off as short to some of you. For the most part, it's a little bit of my blunt personality. I really do appreciate the time and attention you are giving to me. It means a lot, especially now when I am feeling very lost. I'm sorry if the gratitude isn't coming off in the replies. A personal apology goes out to those who I was a bit hostile to regarding PCOS. I was previously misinformed about it and it is not right for me to come off as hostile to those who clearly know more than I do. Once again, thank you for your time and energy. I will work to be better in this regard.",295,220,2019-05-08,birth experience
AskDocs,I want to get my uterus removed,"I'm a 23 year old woman and I've been suffering ever since I first got my period 11 years ago. Several gynecologists have suggested I have endometriosis but they never actually never tested me for it. I've been on the pill since I was 18 but it doesn't solve my uterine problems. It does take away the symptoms but I often experience paralysing cramps and heavy bleeding during my period. I once had a period that lasted 40 days.
Last cycle I decided to skip the pill and it was the worst cycle I have ever had. The ovulation was very painful and the pain faded very slowly. My period came a week early and lasted 5 days. Those days have been hell. The bleeding was extreme and the cramps made me throw up and have diarrhea at the same time for hours. I got sick when I stood up. My uterus felt as if it was filthy water balloon in my belly.
This reminded me I'll probably have to deal with this for 30 more years. I want to look into getting my uterus removed and don't feel like dying every month. I've never wanted any children so I donkt think I'd ever regret such a procedure.
The only thing holding me back is the fact that I'm very scared of getting surgery. Anaesthesia scares me a lot. I don't like the idea of people cutting into me.
On the other side my uterus disgust me and I get sick thinking about it.
I'm from Belgium so if I decide to get the procedure my insurance will cover the costs if tests prove the procedure is necessary to improve my health.

AskDocs,"My GF (15) has multiple illnesses and is projected to live only until 23 years old. These include blood, heart and lung problems, as well as a recently diagnosed brain tumor. What can I do?","I am a junior high school student. My only medical experience is with volunteer organizations and the occasional observation of medical professionals at work. If any of you are doctors in the Philippines and/or are familiar with medical laws that apply there, please let me know.

My GF has been sick since birth. She inherited this from her dad's side, who were mostly sickly and short-lived. She has the following problems; (walking?) pneumonia, haemophilia, leukaemia, and heart failure, as well as a brain tumour (recently). Her illness is unclear. however, as it is spread throughout her entire body.

Her recent medical history (within the past month) includes:

1. 2 Blood Plasma Transfusions due to:
2. Undergoing Hypovolemic Shock 2 times due to blood loss caused by:
3. 2 stab wounds; one on her left thigh and one on her abdomen.
4. During a visit, the doctor mentioned something about a weakened immune system.

Her symptoms include the occasional hyperventilation, breathing problems, and coughing - all due to emotional stress, as well as vomiting blood, low blood pressure, and low O2SAT. Her bleeding is also uncontrollable and does not stop even after almost an hour of pressure. She also suffers from weakness and fatigue when not able to eat or drink, or when doing physical activity.

She visits the hospital frequently with her aunt or older relatives, who know about her condition. This is just a handful of people. She doesn't stay in-patient for long though, due to her having to keep up with school as well (to keep the condition a secret, for reasons I've posted about in other subreddits.)

She's projected to live until she's 23.

What's the best way for me to help her, and possibly manage her symptoms? What do I need to do/acquire to make sure I know what exactly her condition is? What can I do to ease her pain? How can I help her?

Edit: Yes, it does seem like she's lying. All I know for sure are the symptoms I've listed and haemophilia, as I've seen it myself during a few hospital visits. I said it had to be kept a secret (even from her one surviving parent), so I'm in need of legal advice in the Philippines to see if that's actually viable, or if I'm being strung along. Thanks to all those who took this seriously.

Edit 2: I'll try and talk to her about this. Thank you for the replies.

I do confirm I've made a prompt about this in the WritingPrompts subreddit. That was a mistake. I know it seems like just some writing fuckery or something but I honestly don't know what went through my head while writing that. I'm confused. I don't know how to react to this shit and being able to post whatever about it in a place with little or no consequence is a huge comfort for me. I guess it's just me trying to grab attention to my problems however I can. I'm not trying to be unsincere about this. I hope y'all understand that.

AskDocs,I’m Living Any Woman’s Nightmare and Any Advice Would be Extremely Helpful,"I’m 20 years old and ever since I first bled I have never once stopped bleeding naturally.


So yea warning for somewhat graphic material? Blood, period, female stuff. Men click away! 


It’s a long one so TLDR at bottom. 


But yea like I said, the bleeding never stops. I still remember being tween-aged (somewhere between 12-14 I’d say) and already going through the stress of puberty and high school, and experiencing the absolute horror of having a heavy period (I’m talking bleeding through my pants during class, waking up in near puddle of my own blood in the mornings, ruining my bed sheets) and seeing it continue on long after the normal week-long duration. 


I bled for multiple months before my mom and I finally went in to see my doctor, a pediatrician at the time. He prescribed me one month of birth control pills to sort of “reset” my uterus. The pills worked fine, but if I stopped taking them, the horribly heavy bleeding would come right back, so this meant I absolutely could not forget to take them every single day. Remembering that was a stressful task for tween-aged me. Imagine having to nonchalantly slink off at a slumber party or camping trip to pop out a little pill from a tin foil blister pack, trying to hide from your young and naive friends what you are afraid would be found shameful or taboo to them. 


Once the “reset” month ended of course the bleeding came right back. 


This time mom and I went and a saw a gynecologist, she was a super nice young lady. She showed me various different methods of birth control and how they worked, and I decided I liked the idea of Nexplanon - a little chip that goes in your arm, under your skin, and works for 3 years. The operation wasn’t so bad, they completely numbed my arm up and I just closed my eyes while she inserted it. I wore a bandage around my arm for the next few days. And it worked perfectly! For about 3 years I didn’t bleed once. Nothing. I was so happy and was able to live my life without that horrible stress. 


3 years expired however, and the bleeding came back, lightly but still continuing long after a weeks time. Unfortunately, the nice gynecologist lady moved away and I had to find a new doctor. 


He was a nice young guy who was able to easily replace my Nexplanon chip with a new one. 


Buuut, a month or so goes by, the bleeding doesn’t stop. This didn’t happen last time...


I go back in to see my gyno, he prescribes me birth control pills monthly on top of the Nexplanon. When ever I mentioned that I was on this to any girl friends of mine, they would always be slightly shocked or concerned about it, which I typically laughed about because I agree! But it works ?? Also I’ve never noticed any negative side effects in BC for me, in fact it usually seemed to make me normal?? 


However, like clock work, I noticed about every three months my BC pills would stop working and the bleeding would  come back, lightly, but still occurring every single day without stop. Each time one pill would stop working, I’d go into my gynos office, get prescribed a different brand of BC pills (they all varied in package design and pill color, but all the same blister pack pills) they’d stop the bleeding for a few months, it would start to come back, and repeat... 


I had seen a couple different gynos at this point. 


However recently the original gyno I had, the nice lady, moved back! I have gone to see her at the beginning of this year and she took a blood sample from me and it came back suggesting that I had a high thyroid level, and prescribed me daily pills to take which we will later test to see if it helps. She told me the high thyroid level could be a causing factor of the bleeding. She then ordered an ultrasound to make sure nothing bad was going on in my uterus, the results came back all clear. She also suggested removing the Nexplanon and putting in the IUD Myrena (the little plastic thing that goes inside your uterus) I agreed, I have once read an article from a woman in a similar situation that said an IUD solved her problem. 


I was nervous as hell but made it my New Years mission to get this shit figured out. I went in and she had to have me laid out on a cot with my legs up in those stirrup things so she could insert this big long metal contraption up my U-no-what (I didn’t look at what she was doing because I would freak out if I did lol, so this is based on what I was feeling and hearing) The procedure felt like a series of really painful menstral cramps, wasn’t that bad for me because I’ve been having bad cramps for ages. But it did hurt and was super uncomfortable. She was done fairly quickly, and warned me that I could become dizzy after the procedure and not to get up for a couple minutes. She used that time to remove my Nexplanon. 


My mom has gotten IUD many years ago and advised me to have my boyfriend pick me up after the procedure, because you get waves of bad cramps after getting an IUD put in. And booooy did I. The cramps I had about every 20-30 minutes were the most intense and excruciating I’ve ever had. When they hit I would be hollering and writhing in pain. I also had intense dizziness for a while, I almost passed out when I got up to use the bathroom at one point. I had to call into work that day, I had no idea I would be knocked out of commission for 24 hours. I couldn’t leave my bed that day. But I was able to go to work the next day and the cramps became fewer and far between and eventually going away. 


The bleeding has STILL continued however. 


I told my gyno that I was and she prescribed two pills I had to take every day to control the bleeding. They made the bleeding light and very dark and sort of “dried out” seeming. (Sorry, gross I know) but it still didn’t actually go away. 


And I have just now refilled my thyroid meds, but the two pills I took to control the bleeding were not refilled. They weren’t supposed to be permanent. So I’m now at a phase of seeing whats happening. I currently have an IUD in place and take my daily thyroid meds, but I’m STILL. FUCKING. BLEEDING. It’s getting worse to as more days go by without those two pills I was taking. I have a couple packs left over of BC pills, I noticed when I take one it works that very day and makes the bleeding completely stop. However I want to ration them for when I really need them, and like I mentioned earlier, the BC pills stop working over time. 


My gyno said that if I don’t stop bleeding with the Myrena IUD that I will have to have it removed and a smaller one put in. I don’t want to go through that procedure again TWICE. I will avoid it at all costs. I read on the Myrena website that it can take 3-6 months for the IUD to adjust and regulate itself...but that’s an insane amount of time to put up with profuse bleeding, and if my body continues like it has been all these years, then I have a feeling it won’t stop anyway. 


I really feel as if I’m living in some sort of nightmare, this is always looming in the back of my mind and makes me anxious all the time. Hard to ignore when I’m bleeding constantly to remind me of it. 


Today I had to throw away a cute white thong with grey leopard print. I got cocky during my shift and wore only a panty liner. I’m just happy I didn’t bleed through my jeans. 


I hate that I’m stuck in this cycle of paying the copay to see my gyno, paying the fees for any blood work or procedures they do, paying the copay every time I refill my prescription....on and on. I don’t want to take pills everyday. I hate driving miles to the ONE pharmacy my insurance works through, I hate waiting in line at the pharmacy for what feels like forever and then being told I have to wait another 15-20 minutes, I hate having to puy pads and tampons all the time. I hate that my sex life is being strained because of this?? My boyfriend is so wonderful and patient and has been super supportive during this, but I still feel such horrible guilt and obviously wish we could have sex again.


I have asked every girl I know, including my mom and have always just gotten a shrug. I have googled it countless times but never quite finding any information that serves my unique situation. I’m so sad and stressed that I’m STILL struggling with this and I just want to know what is wrong with me, and why this is happening. I’ve never heard of anyone experiencing this and it’s honestly so scary. 


I really enjoy the Reddit community and reading posts on here gives me great comfort when I’m stressed, which is why I’ve decided to share this story here in hopes one of you many smart folks may have any advice or opinions on it. Or if anyone has experienced something similar and what you’ve done to treat it? 

Thanks so much for reading.

TLDR - Ever since I first got my period it has been horrifically heavy and never went away. I’ve been through multiple gynecologists and tried various different birth control methods which work for awhile but every time the bleeding eventually comes back. It’s extremely stressful and anxiety inducing for me, and any advice, opinions, or similar experiences anyone could share would be extremely helpful to me.

NICUParents,Talk to me about your preemie’s milestones!,"
Did they develop based on their corrected age, actual age or did they fall somewhere in between? Please include what gestation your babe was born ☺️

Our girl was born September 8th, 2018 at 29+4. She is now 20 weeks old actual but only 10 weeks old corrected. At 10 days corrected she was already beyond her corrected age. Now at 2.5 months corrected she is the size of a 2.5 month old (still wearing newborn clothing) but development wise, fall somewhere in the middle of the two ages. At her 4 month shots (they’re based on actual age) the nurse asked me a bunch of milestone questions and she hit every single one for 4 months. I just got the advanced development paperwork from her physiotherapist and she checked off 95% or more of the 4 month milestones there too. 

Wondering when your babes hit the big milestones, like sitting up, crawling, walking, talking, etc. 

[Day 1 to Now ](https://imgur.com/a/x2pmoF0)

I think I need to edit and add: I have zero concerns over  her development/reaching milestones. She is well beyond where she needs to be and I’m not stressing about her development. She see’s Physiotherapist’s and developmental therapists to make sure she is on track for her adjusted age. I’m letting her take the lead and not trying to rush her. Honestly, I wish she would just stay my tiny baby forever but sadly they grow up so darn fast 😢",28,38,2019-01-29,gestational age

I'm trying to get an idea of what to expect for my girls growth wise. They were born relatively small but gained rapidly in the first few months. Now their weight gain has slowed to may be 1 pound a month and I'm a little worried. They're happy and overall healthy which gives me hope, but tiny babes.

NICUParents,"NICU mothers, how to stay motivated to pump?","Hi everyone, I had a twin pregnancy, but one of my girls passed in utero a few weeks prior to birth. My surviving twin has been in the NICU for about a week and a half. Gestational age was 26 weeks + 1. 

During the day I have no problem pumping every 2-3 hours. It's still a struggle to schedule when to get out to NICU (30 min drive from house, 2 hours by bus) pump, fulfill other obligations, and eat the ridiculous amount of calories and drink the crazy amount of fluid needed to produce milk. 

But the toughest part is waking up in the middle of the night. I have slept through alarms for 6 to 9 hours three nights in a row now. That means that long period without pumping. I'm a FTM, but I imagine a crying/screaming newborn is slightly more motivation for waking up. 

I'm making enough milk for my daughter's feed, but I'm just worried about my future supply. Any tips are helpful!

Update: Thank you everyone for your help! Getting extra pump parts has helped. I got addicted to cookies and/or graham crackers with milk while I was being monitored in the hospital and while recovering from my C-section. Now I'm only letting myself indulge if I wake up in the middle of the night. Plus, I've come to peace with the fa t that my milk might run out and it's okay if my daughter has formula instead. For now, I'm making enough for her and that's what matters.",18,24,2019-04-09,gestational age
NICUParents,35 Weeker Still on O2 at 12 Weeks,"Hi, everyone.  I’m new to this sub but I am hoping to get some feedback on my son’s situation.  He was born at 35+3 after I developed severe preeclampsia and was kept in the NICU for 12 hours after birth but did not require any intervention at that time.  He was discharged from the hospital on day 2 of life but then readmitted on day 4 due to jaundice.  At that time, he was put on O2 because they noticed he would occasionally desat to the low 80s.  The staff said that this was not uncommon, both because he was early and because we live at 5,500 feet above sea level.  They did a chest x-day while he was there and saw nothing abnormal or concerning.

He was discharged again on day 6 and sent home with O2 (setting on portable tank is 1/16, which I think corresponds to 0.06 L/min?).  He failed his overnight pulse ox study at 4 weeks with sats below 88 35% of the time.  Then he failed another overnight pulse ox study at 8 weeks with sats below 88 13% of the time.  He did another study last week at 11 weeks - we are waiting for the results, but both my husband and I saw sats in the low 80s on the monitor so we’re thinking he failed this one too.

We are concerned that he is still on O2 nearly three months after birth, and we feel bad because we don’t really take him anywhere very often because of the hassle of the tank and because his whole life, he’s had a cannula up his nose and stuck to his face.  His pediatrician said that it’s okay he’s still on O2 but we are wondering when he will be able to get off of it.  (I should add that, thankfully, he has had no other health issues other than the jaundice since he was born, and that resolved pretty quickly after light therapy was initiated.)

Has anyone here had a similar experience?  How long did it take for your baby of similar gestational age to get off oxygen and did that process involve weaning?  Should we be concerned about lung issues since it’s taking him longer than expected to be off O2?  I would really appreciate any feedback - thanks so much!

Edited to add:  I did get two doses of steroids in the hospital before he was born.",15,20,2019-12-18,gestational age
NICUParents,Feeding Setbacks: How long did it take for your baby to learn how to eat?,"I've posted my baby's story before, but to summarize her risk factors:
•born 36+3 to a diabetic mother, so large for gestational age (9lb6oz)
•body cooling due to metabolic acidosis 
•grade 3 brain bleed (resolved itself quickly)
•enflamed and infected liver
•four platelet transfusions because her blood wouldn't clot

That was exactly a month ago yesterday. At this point, each of those issues resolved. (Well, she's still an idm). For the past 3.5 weeks of our stay she's been working on feeding. She has no neurological issues working against her. We wanted to see how she'd do without her NG tube, just try it out and see. 

Day one she was taking 60ml per feed with a premie nipple. This was insane progress as before she had only been taking 20mls through an ultra premie. We were beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel. To be safe we did a swallow study to make sure this new nipple was good. It wasn't. It was silently penetrating her airway and on day two of this trial her intake reduced to 35mls per feeding. We had to put her NG tube back and realize that she isn't as ready as we thought.They're going to try to mix my breastmilk with gelmix and use a higher flow nipple to see if the volumes improve. Then its giving her more time.

 I'm preaching to the choir here, I know, but it's so hard to have her there and commute. We can stay bedside and I do as much as my mental health will allow. My husband has some pretty strong hospital related anxiety, so I'm doing most of this by myself. I'm feeling like this night has no dawn. The nurse practitioner casually mentioned that it could take weeks or months. Months. I never imagined that it could take that long and I'm just... devestated. I came home today and sobbed looking at her baby swing wondering if she was ever even going to use it or if she'd outgrow it before I could take her home. 

So tldr: how long did it take for your babies to get that proverbial lightbulb moment?",8,20,2019-08-03,gestational age
NICUParents,Update PPROM at 22+4 with di/di twins (warning: loss),"Original post: https://reddit.com/r/NICUParents/comments/dtltvr/pprom_at_224_with_didi_twins/

My wife’s water broke on Friday November 8th and we were discharged with instructions to monitor for any signs of infection or labor or any changes in discharge. 

On Saturday we had a nervous day of laying in bed and watching lots of Scrubs. Late in the afternoon my wife noticed some shooting abdominal pain and dull lower back pain so we called the perinatal doctor we spoke to the day before and she recommended we take a trip to the hospital to be evaluated. We had a nervous trip down to the hospital and were hooked to the monitor and the nurse was able to find both heartbeats and we were immediately relieved. They took an ultrasound and everything looked ok, in fact baby A appeared to have accumulated some fluid since the day before which was a good sign. We were discharged again but felt like we might be ok. 

On Monday morning my wife woke up to a pink discharge which we called in to L&D and they told us to come in for another evaluation. This time our drive to the hospital was less nervous and more scared. We were hooked to the monitor and they searched for baby A’s heart for a few minutes without luck. They pinned down baby B and went back to searching for baby A. A few more minutes and another nurse came in to try. Our hearts were falling but we still didn’t know for sure. When the doctor came in with the ultrasound she found baby A and her heart was still. A second doctor came in to confirm the diagnosis. One of our twins had died in the womb. 

Monday we were 23 weeks exactly and we were admitted. The hospital has a Level 3 NICU so we were where we needed to be. At this point my wife still had no signs of preterm labor. No contractions. We were counseled by neonatology about outcomes for babies born at 23 weeks in case my wife went into labor or in case they needed to do an emergency c-section. After having just lost baby A, we were willing to do anything to keep baby B and opted to agree to all resuscitative measures in case they were needed. 

My wife began on the antibiotics and received her first round of steroids. We were absolutely crushed by the loss of baby A. My wife lost her father earlier this year and it has felt like a series of losses have struck us in a row. We spent our first night in the hospital scared for baby B and mourning the loss of baby A. The course of action at this point was to keep monitoring for signs of infection, keep tabs on mom’s and baby’s vitals, and watch for any symptoms of labor. 

We woke up early Tuesday morning to cramps that felt like period cramps. We knew that at this gestational age contractions can be fairly light so we got hooked back into the monitor and my wife was given Tylenol and iv fluids. The cramps subsided. 

In the morning we celebrated being pregnant another day. My wife had a bowel movement and noticed something protruding from her vagina, it was baby A’s foot. My wife had an unmedicated vaginal delivery of baby A without contractions or labor. Baby B stayed inside. We got to hold our baby girl and give her a name. We got to say goodbye. We named her Chioma. My wife was a rockstar but I crumbled holding her tiny body. They sutured the umbilical cord as close to the cervix as possible and noted that the cervix had closed after delivery. 

Since then it has been back to the waiting game. Grieving for Chioma. Grieving the unfulfilled plans and dreams of raising twin little girls. But also celebrating the life still within my wife. Hopeful but terrified. Today marks 24 weeks and 6 days. Every day is a gift and every day improves baby B’s chances.

We have good days and bad. We have a lot of visitors, we have used redbox more in the last two weeks then the last two years. 

It’s a very strange emotional mix, the sadness, the anger, the happiness, the fear. It’s very strange that the best outcome at this point is a long protracted hospital stay followed by a short NICU stay for Baby B. 

Thank you for the support we received when I first posted about the membrane rupture. This is an amazing and supportive community. Our nurses and our doctors have been incredible and have provided excellent care. 

We’re still here, counting days and hoping and praying for positive outcomes.",76,10,2019-11-25,gestational age
NICUParents,Living life in the NICU,"Hello! I want to start out by saying that this group has been a huge inspiration for my husband and I. So thank you to everyone out there willing to share their stories! 

Our little girl was born at 25+4 weeks due to severe preeclampsia and HELLP. Certainly not the entrance in to the world we expected. She is now 5 weeks old and 31 weeks gestational age. She is doing pretty well thus far but I know we’re just at the beginning our our journey. 

My question to everyone is, how did you make it through your NICU stay without losing sight of yourself, significant other, and life outside the NICU? And keeping sight of life after all of this?

NICUParents,"Induction on Dec 9, 2019 (at 34 weeks GA) FTM with some questions...","Just a quick background, I have an incompetent cervix, found out at 26 weeks and have been hospital bedrest. Water broke at 30 weeks. Induced labor will be scheduled at 34 weeks to avoid future infection since I am 2cm dilated, completely open, etc. I've gotten the complete set of steroid shots and was told I won't be getting anymore. Same goes for magnesium since they only do those at 32 weeks or earlier. And my baby boy is a few oz short of being 3lbs. (he was 2lbs and 12oz last week)

For those who have experienced the same or witnessed the same case, when I do go into labor (vaginal birth at the moment because baby's head is down), will it be quicker since I am already 2cm dilated or will that not matter? I'm nervous for the labor and don't like not knowing what to expect...I'd like to at least get some idea of how things will go for me, whether it will take 15 hrs or 3 hrs to push the little one out. I know it might be different from case to case.

Also, how well do babies at that gestational age and weight do in terms of NICU stay? They say 34 weeks babies do very well but my LO is on the smaller side...

Any other advice before I go on Monday? Please and thank you!",3,17,2019-12-05,gestational age
NICUParents,Happy Birthday Update: PPROM at 22+4 with di/di twins (warning: loss),"Brief overview of what brought us here. My wife was pregnant with spontaneous di/di twins, due March 9, 2020. On November 8, Twin A/Chioma's water broke. On November 11, we went into the hospital for an evaluation and found out that her heart had stopped. Her sister, Kelenna, was still alive with intact membranes. My wife was admitted and on November 12, delivered Chioma naturally. During our hospital stay we were receiving NSTs three times a day. I'm a bit fuzzy on when the first significant decel happened, but it was around the weekend of December 7. We were put on constant monitoring with the hope that it was an isolated incident and we could go back to three times daily if we had a clean trace until the next morning. Instead we began almost a week of constant monitoring and late night decels that Kelenna always recovered from, but had the perinatal team asking when she would decel and not recover that would necessitate an emergency c-section. (Kelenna was breach throughout this period.)

Early in the morning of December 12, we had multiple decels including at least one that necessitated my wife to be put on NPO and to start on magnesium. Our resident came by during rounds and told me I should not go in to work that day. When the perinatologist came in, she highly recommended that we move forward with an urgent scheduled, but not emergency c-section. We cried over the decision but ultimately agreed that this was our daughter telling us that she was ready to make her grand entrance and that we should listen to our doctors. She would be born at 27+3 gestational age; a month to the day that her twin sister was born. The c-section was scheduled for 10 AM and our daughter was born at 10:30.

We heard her crying before we saw her during the ""drive-by"" on her way to the isolette. The NICU team stabilized her and she scored an 8 on the Apgar at 5 minutes. 

In the intervening weeks, my wife has recovered from her surgery remarkably well. She was discharged 5 days after delivery, but if we hadn't spent the last month in L&D it probably would have been sooner. We got into the housing for family members with loved ones in the hospital which has been absolutely huge for helping us adjust to our new life as NICU parents.

Kelenna is doing great, she is taking full feeds and gaining weight, she's been on bubble CPAP of 4-5 since day 4 or so. I'm convinced NICU life is harder on us the parents than it is on her. In addition to the stress of having a loved one in the hospital for the foreseeable future, we have also been grieving over multiple losses. Of her sister's life of course, but also of our chance to be parents of twins. Of getting to see her grow up with a twin sister, to see how they were the same and how they were different. We are also grieving the loss of a normal third trimester and having a baby in the hospital.

My heart swells with joy every time I see her, and it breaks every time we have to leave.

We've been doing normal parent things, changing diapers, taking temperatures and giving baths. Waking up twice a night to pump, and being exhausted throughout the day. Mama loves the skin to skin; she bradied twice on me my first time holding her, so I'm waiting until she's a little more stable to do it again.

Thanks again to /r/NICUParents for the support and for helping me know what was in store for us when they finally told us this baby was ready.",66,9,2019-12-31,gestational age
NICUParents,Kangaroo Care Anniversary,"On this day last year, my little one was 3 weeks old, 26 weeks gestational age, and I got to hold her for the very first time. It took her nurse and 2 respiratory therapists to move her from her isolette to the gravity chair I was sitting in a few steps away. She had reached a mighty 810 grams that day, and it barely felt like she was there once we were snuggled in together, save for the vibrations from the high frequency jet ventilator. 

Those first 21 days of her life had been some of the scariest I had lived, but finally being reunited was heavenly. It was a little nerve wracking: she was still so tiny, there was so much equipment attached to her that needed to stay in place and not be jiggled about (I'm a little curious how many rolls of tape were used during her NICU stay), and she was still so fragile hour to hour and day to day. There was this primal part of my brain that had been aching for my baby, needing her to be nearer. And then some very careful hands put her on my chest and that longing ache quieted. We were together. We were going to be alright. 

She got held every day that it was allowed after that, save for some very difficult days where the team felt it was too risky to move her. Those long afternoons spent together on the gravity chairs in the NICU were where she slept the best, satted the best, and was able to have her oxygen turned to lower levels. I really and truly feel that part of why she has done so well is because of all the hours spent skin to skin.

I can't advocate enough for it, kangaroo care is so good for babies.

NICUParents,7 months later I have decided to start therapy for my traumatic birth experience and the NICU stay,"My girl was born at 35wks and 3 days due to placenta abrupta and an emergency c-section. I went from perfectly normal happy pregnancy to traumatized new mom in about three hours. 

I realized a few weeks ago that i think about the birth and hospital stay daily. It makes me feel so lost and out of control. My therapist is recommending exposure therapy by writing about my experience every day. I realized that what happened was, in fact, traumatic. I am slowly progressing. I stopped crying when i write about it. 

I really think this will help process and to stop letting that experience define me and my baby girl, because apart from my scar and how i feel, we are doing amazing. She is the happiest, chubbiest little seven month old. 

However, i feel that the hospital ‘forgot’ to take care of my mental health during my stay and hers. I was literally shaking from shock for two days afterwards in hospital and they didnt intervene at all. I think i will write them an email to encourage that they do analyse this and take steps for the future.

I just want to encourage everyone here to take good care of themselves and eachother and to find help when you need it. ",29,8,2019-03-20,birth experience
