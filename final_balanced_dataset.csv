BabyBumps,I’m 34 weeks pregnant and my mother is grossed out by my “fat” body.,"My mom is obsessed with being skinny. I’m quarantined with her. It’s hell. I had trouble standing up from lying flat on the tile floor after stretching and she calls me a fat pig. No she’s not being funny. Called me fatty when I was just sitting on the couch on my phone. 

I’m fucking pregnant. I’m over 34 weeks pregnant. I should have this belly. And I’m really proud of it. I’m not insecure about my weight. Yes, I do want to lose this extra weight as soon as I can after birth, but I’m okay with how I look. 

The whole point of this post is to rant I guess because it’s so fucking annoying. Just being around someone who sighs whenever they see you eat is fucking obnoxious. Now every time I look at her I know she thinks I’m ugly. I feel it. And I literally can’t do anything about it. I’m staying here until the baby can get some vaccinations and then my husband and I are moving out of state. I’m also having a really hard time figuring out when’s the safest time for us to move because of this, you know, global pandemic thing going on. I don’t even know how to handle this.

BabyBumps,Surprise third baby - Still traumatized by second birth (long),"Hi guys, long time reddit lurker, finally signed up. I'm 36 years old and 22+6 weeks pregnant with my third child. 
My youngest child is 2 1/2 and her birth was a nightmare. I had a precipitous labor of one hour at 40+2 weeks and walked into the hospital with her head poking out and meconium everywhere. To make matters worse, I had a complete retained placenta after the midwife lifted my daughter into the air, snapping the cord off. I started haemorraging and by the time an operating theater was available for manual removal I had lost nearly 2 liters of blood. 
I was not planning on any more children but managed to fall pregnant despite contraception. I can't put into words how terrified I am of the birth. I'm excited about the baby but I don't want to die. It's like I can't even see past the birth, it's the be all and end all of everything. My partner is quite blase about it and says if it happens again they'll just fix it. That's not the point!

BabyBumps,Tips for a discreet pregnancy?,"I'm currently 6w+3 with my 2nd.

This pregnancy was planned but I just **love** my privacy and want to stave off the unsolicited commentary/advice for as long as possible (especially anything related to preterm birth, because our first was a NICU baby). Another element is our daughter is 17m so the ""when are you going to start trying for another?"" 's are coming in more and more frequently. Any tips on hiding a pregnancy? Specifically for the holiday season where we will be around a lot of family, food, and alcohol? My husband has already tried to teach me how to ""take"" a shot and spit it discreetly into a chaser, so there's that, but I told him if I absolutely have to have part of a drink to avoid being interrogated then for the sake of my mental health, I will.

NICUParents,How long did you go with your second / third pregnancy?,"Hi friends,   


My daughter was born three years ago at 33w3d after an uneventful, healthy pregnancy due to PPROM. We never figured out what caused the PPROM; there was no infection, cervical shortening wasn't confirmed, etc. 

We were lucky; we only spent 17 days in the NICU before taking her home healthy. But still, as I'm sure you can relate, our little one being in the NICU was one of the most stressful times of our lives and one that I'm not eager to repeat.   


Here I am 21w3d pregnant with my second baby. I thought that my daughter being born so early was a fluke and that it wouldn't happen again, but my OB was monitoring me pretty closely and found that I had a drop in cervical length between 18 and 20 weeks from 4.7cm to 2.6-3.0cm which is pretty dramatic. 

I'm on progesterone suppositories and go in again today, a week after my last, for another ultrasound. My OB has suggested I'll probably get a cerclage put in, and I'm not sure how effective they are, but I'm still really interested to hear...   


**If your first (or second) pregnancy resulted in a preterm birth, how long did you carry your subsequent pregnancy for? And when (how many weeks) was your first preterm baby born?**

BabyBumps,Depression during pregnancy,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety before pregnancy. Was on medication and saw a therapist. Now that I’m pregnant I still see the therapist, but am off my medication. The first trimester was great. I’m 17 weeks now and for the past month or so have had weekly suicidal thoughts. I would never do anything because I would never hurt this baby, but they’re still there.

I don’t think about how I would do it like I used to think (again, my mind protecting my baby I think). I just think about how my world would be easier/less painful if I weren’t here.

I feel very, very lonely right now. On top of it all, my husband may get a specialized residency in another city. This means packing up, moving, starting all over, getting a new teaching job in a new district (which is so hard, I’ve done it before). Making new friends. All with a newborn. The thought makes me sick and makes me not want to be here even more. It would be easier if I weren’t here.

BabyBumps,Working moms - how do you get through first trimester morning sickness?,"I'm a STM (7 weeks atm) struggling with severe nausea throughout the day and night. I know I should be thankful that I don't have hyperemesis (persistant vomiting) like some moms have, but I just wanted to know how other working moms coped through the first trimester as I literally battle to get any work done.

Often I have to sit next to the toilet for periods of time because I'm on the verge of throwing up, and even if it's not that bad it's enough to make focusing on work really difficult. Being in a male-run corporate environment there is little understanding for what women go through during pregnancy. I don't even know if I would be allowed to use my sick leave for this, but I feel so sick all the time. I'm so behind in my work and also don't have the energy to work through the night to make it up. Anyone else in the same boat or have some advice?  


I think it may be due to the prenatal vitamins as well because I switched to taking them at night thinking that would be better and I woke up 30 min after taking them with the worst nausea I've experienced so far. It probably also doesn't help that due to the nausea I'm eating like a cracker here and there - can't stomach dinner or proper food that my hubby cooks.",11,25,04/02/2020,coping during pregnancy,236,PRE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pregnancy has been all kinds of complicated (monochorionic twins who developed TTTS and had to be operated... then PPROM) and because of it, the C-section is planned for week 32. I am currently at 26 weeks and trying to prepare for the extended NICU stay. At least, we can consider ourselves lucky to know ahead of time that our babies will be in the NICU for while and prepare.


Will I get to see my babies when they are born or will they be too young for any kind of skin to skin? Will I be able to visit them while I recover from the C-section at the hospital?
After I get discharged (~4 days), how long should I spend at the NICU everyday? Will I get to take care of my babies?
What will life be like with two little ones in the hospital? I'm assuming I will also have to limit my contact with people to avoid getting sick?

BabyBumps,Silly but legitimate waxing question (I may be in the early stages of labor),"SOOOO. I'm 38 weeks today. I had planned on getting a brazillian sometime around now in my pregnancy. I asked my doctor, she seemed fine with it as long as I didn't get my stomach waxed. 
I know I've seen a lot of things talking about increased chance of infection with hair removal. Hence why I asked. 

Well. I have a wax appointment scheduled for tomorrow. Yesterday I was having super mild contractions that were so random and weren't painful at all. 
Last night I got woken up 3-4 times from pretty painful ones (this happened at least an hour and a half to two hours apart each time)

And I""ve been having more contractions (they are definitely more painful than yesterday, but all of them aren't painful) more frequently. While doing my usual morning routine they were anywhere from 5-9 minutes apart lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute and a half. THey've since become more infrequent again (now it's almost like every 15 minutes). My water has not broken. I haven't lost my mucus plug. I am not leaking. 

SO...What would you do? Trying to decide if I should cancel the wax or not...I've read that waxing is probably better than shaving (I used to wax all the time, so I know the pain aspect and all of that good stuff)

Water broke at 30 weeks. Induced labor will be scheduled at 34 weeks to avoid future infection since I am 2cm dilated, completely open, etc. I've gotten the complete set of steroid shots and was told I won't be getting anymore. Same goes for magnesium since they only do those at 32 weeks or earlier. And my baby boy is a few oz short of being 3lbs. (he was 2lbs and 12oz last week)

For those who have experienced the same or witnessed the same case, when I do go into labor (vaginal birth at the moment because baby's head is down), will it be quicker since I am already 2cm dilated or will that not matter? I'm nervous for the labor and don't like not knowing what to expect...I'd like to at least get some idea of how things will go for me, whether it will take 15 hrs or 3 hrs to push the little one out. I know it might be different from case to case.

This pregnancy and delivering a healthy baby is all I look forward too nowadays. I’ve went from working two jobs to now just looking for one, and I feel like I’m already failing my little one.

Once she is born she will need surgery on her intestines almost immediately and I won't be able to see her for hours afterward. After surgery I won't be able to hold her for a while (the process of putting intestines back inside the body is kinda slow).

My boss wanted me to reach out to HR about making sure my maternity leave/paperwork is taken care of and I started thinking....

I want to have time off of work when they come *home*, not while they are still in the hospital. 

How did all of you deal with this kind of situation and should I suggest anything to HR?

After I sat straight up for 10 minutes they went away (laying down and walking didn't work). Now I'm done. I want him out. I never went into natural labor with my first, he was induced from start to finish, so all this is new. I want the waiting to stop. Its killing me to not be able to play with my preschooler or have sexy times with my husband. Please help. 

P.s. I will not do anything dangerous. While I do want labor, not that bad. I also am weird and LOVE hearing old wives tales for everything, so if you want to just say that for any part of pregnancy, I don't mind.",11,26,03/11/2019,induced labor,175,PRE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,I am furious at my family.,"This is a throwaway account since my friends know my main one. We are expecting our first, and we were excited so we decided to tell our families a little early. It was convenient, we were all going to be on a group call anyway so it would be a fun way to surprise them without being suspicious. We explicitly told them not to tell anyone yet, as we are only at 10 weeks, and things can still happen. 

Not 24 hours later my dad has told his coworkers, my mom has called and told her friends, and my stepmom told her group of friends. We didn't tell them that ""hey don't tell anyone because we could still potentially have a miscarriage"" but just told them it's a family secret don't tell. That should have been enough. 

Anyway, got a text from one of my best friends this morning on ""congratulations, i heard y'all are expecting."" Not really how I wanted him to find out, through a friend of one of my parents, especially when we are still so early along. 

This is just a venting post, I'm so mad at my family that I can't trust them with something so simple. If we have another in the future I guess they will find out when the baby is born, because I'm definitely not trusting them to keep the secret.",343,99,23/08/2020,born early,230,POST,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m in the wide awake club. Had a gel induction at 2 pm yesterday (I’m 12 days over due day) Immediate contractions that got very strong very fast. Plans for a pool delivery were scrapped fairly quickly and I opted for an epidural. Best. Thing. Ever. I can feel everything ( like you can feel someone holding your had) but zero pain. Even the catheter going in. I can also move my legs, but no walking. But I don’t feel trapped and can try different positions when pushing time comes. After a breakdown due to being alone a lot at first, thanks anxiety, I’m now so chilled and happy.  Just waiting to be told I’m at 10 and it’s go time.

BabyBumps,How do you deal with possible depression over an unintended pregnancy?,"Before I say anything, just be aware that yes, I AM safe and in contact with my doctors about everything!

So, I might be pregnant. While I've always wanted to be a mom, now is just not the right time. 20 years old, about to move into my first apartment, new job, it's all very stressful. I am pro-choice and pro adoption, but trust me when I say that those are not options for me. When I get my blood test on Monday, if it's positive, I'm raising a baby.

I have depression though, and this pregnancy scare has seen an...unfortunate spike. Especially in suicidal thoughts. What if my partner leaves me and I'm left with a baby by myself? I have an IUD--is this pregnancy ectopic? How would I feel if I miscarried? Can I handle being a mother?

The suicidal thoughts have passed for now, but I fear that a positive test might bring them back. Everybody talks about postpartum depression, but what about depression during the pregnancy? How do you handle it, especially if it's caused by the pregnancy itself?

Edit: blood test was negative! Thank you for the advice, stories, and comfort you all provided me. Having the support of other people who've lived through similar situations made me feel a lot better about the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy.

I've been having very mild cramping that I would just assume was Braxton Hicks or baby stretching if I hadn't had a baby already. Most of the pain when they happen is down low where baby is but they are going across my whole uterus starting at the bottom and going up. It's not consistent but the last two nights I've had them for multiple hours then I go to sleep and they stop. Baby feels like she is grinding into or digging at my cervix. I keep getting stabby needle feelings in my actual vagina. She has had hiccups for the last twenty minutes and Everytime I have a contraction feeling she goes crazy. I feel like I have to pee every 5 minutes and I'm so gassy. When the contractions happen i feel like I need to poop. She is sitting so low and all her movements are down in my pelvis. I have an appt tommorow but I can't decide if I should call the office and talk to them or not since I feel like I'm just being extra paranoid bc my son came early with no warning.,2,3,11/02/2020,preterm labor,211,PRE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I work full time as a project manager for an advertising agency. At the moment, my work is verging on unbearable levels of stress for me. I currently have a couple of very large projects for very big global companies that are crashing and burning because of factors out of my control like third party suppliers.

 As the PM I am the face of the project so I take all of the clients and my companies anger about the project not doing well, and I am working incredibly long days trying to get international teams to solve these problems.

I'm not sleeping well, struggling to eat, and I would say I'm running at about 80-90% panic/stress levels basically around the clock at the moment. I'm really genuinely treading water trying to stay afloat.

My question is, people say that stress is bad for pregnancy, but what can it actually do? And when people say stress do they actually mean, like, a loved one dying or something of that magnitude? There's not a lot I can do about my stress levels right now but I'm worried that I might be causing harm.

I have two questions:
1) I had polyhydramnios with my first pregnancy. Does this mean I’m likely to have it again with number 2?

2) I’ve had HPV for at least 2 years. Usually I get a pap smear once a year, they send me to a gynaecologist and they look at the cells under a microscope and tell me it’s okay. About two weeks ago I had a gynaecologist appointment and she ended up doing 3 biopsies done on my cervix due to “unusual cells” (I was given very little information). They told me that I might need to have a small operation to burn off these cells (which I would be put under general anaesthetic for due to PTSD from birth 1). I have a follow up appointment regarding this on the 17th. My question is would they still go through with the operation now that I’m pregnant? And would the HPV or the operation pose a risk to the baby?",1,2,03/01/2020,PTSD pregnancy,190,PRE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,How to cope during early pregnancy,"Hello all,

So, I am VERY early on in my pregnancy (somewhere in the neighborhood of 5-6 weeks). In all my prep for baby, I did not anticipate how anxiety fueled I would feel at the very beginning. I always assumed that the stressful part was waiting to find out of you were indeed pregnant. I didn't realize that once you actually are pregnant, it is so up in the air the first few weeks and GOODNESS is it making me worried and panicky. 

I had some bleeding right around the time of my missed period, and I actually thought I had my period. Turns out, it was spotting. It was pretty light but I did spot last Friday afternoon/evening and then a bit again Sunday and Monday morning. Spotting was light and only noticeable when wiping. Then this week, I've had some light cramping. Though I've noticed cramping on both sides, I am noticing it more frequently on the left side. 

I have an early ultrasound set up for next Thursday. My doctor wanted to follow-up since I did have some spotting. 

I am mostly wondering: 1) what spotting/cramping was like for other people, 2) how in the world do people make it through the very beginning when it feels so potentially fleeting and up in the air?!!

Thanks, Mamas.

She said that we will need them because the only way to get them in the hospital is from the NICU. Am I wrong to think that the only reason i would need them is if my baby needed to be in the NICU?

My husband and I have discussed me either becoming a SAHM or going back to school to get my masters in teaching. I think teaching would be a much better fit for me and would give me more flexibility to spend time with our child in the future.

However, I'm so unhappy in my job so I would like to make this switch NOW. Thus, to get my toes in the water for teaching, we are considering me quitting my job, taking a few teaching classes in the fall, and start a bit of substitute teaching. If I don't like it, we are OK with me being a SAHM. This switch would mean that our finances would have to become a lot tighter. My husband doesn't make amazing money, but enough that we could make do by making some lifestyle changes. We also have quite a bit of savings.

Combine this with being out of work with little-to-no financial assistance available (being self employed) for almost 6 months so far this year...It has been A TIME.

Which is odd for me because the only thing that can wake me up is my husband leaving for work or the urge to pee. I could sleep through a natural disaster, otherwise.

Tightening turned to painful contractions (every few minutes) with accompanying back pain. I had this for hours until it wore down. Called L&D hours later as I still had tightening, but they did not recommend coming in as it had slowed.

BabyBumps,First baby was overdue and induced; do some people just naturally gestate for 43 weeks?,"Hey everyone. I’m at 38+6 today. No signs of labor yet. Feeling uncomfortable but I could handle another couple of weeks. 

My main worry here is that I have planned (and paid) for a home birth and will have to go to hospital for an induction if I hit 42 weeks. My midwife can’t deliver my baby at home and there’s only one person allowed in the delivery room so she won’t be able to be there at all, even as a doula. 

My daughter was born at 41+5. She was induced, and I wasn’t at all dilated or effaced when I went to the hospital. From what I’ve been able to gather, it looks like second babies usually come a little earlier than first babies, but usually not by much and definitely not always. 

I’m worried because I don’t know how long I would have gone with my first if I hadn’t been induced. I feel like I might just have one of those bodies that stays pregnant naturally for 43-44 weeks.

Mentally I'm hoping for 34 weeks at least like with baby #1 who only had a nine day nicu stay. Curious if anyone has advice for how to prepare/navigate a second NICU experience with a toddler at home. Covid also obviously complicates getting help after coming home, but we do have a part-time nanny already who will continue with us when #2 arrives.

This past month I’ve spent sulking because I wasn’t getting the birth experience I had always pictured. I felt like I was being robbed of some crucial part of motherhood. And in that moment I realized the reason I have these ideas around what birth needs to be is from other moms. Because moms want to share their birth story as a testament to their willingness to sacrifice for their babies. But instead of it leading to support it leads to judgment and one upping each other. What they forget is that we are all making sacrifices and all going through battle to get there. All moms are warriors. 

It doesn’t matter if you labor for 4 or 40 hours, whether it’s a c-section by choice or not by choice, whether you even carry your baby or not.

Sorry if this is not well written. I had a bad reaction to  an ambien last night and they had to give me something to calm down.

By the time they got me in for anther ultrasound there an hour later I had dialated 3-4 centimeters and had a bulging bag.

They called an ambulance to take me to the nearest hospital with a level 3 nicu because we decided we want to do everything everything possible to save his life short of chest compressions (which can cause brain bleeding) and emergency c section, at least until week 24.

Right now my goal is to reach week 24 so he can get steroids to help develop him lungs but I'm afraid I won't make it. We are just trying to take it day by day. 

We started on labor and delivery and it seemed like it would be ok. The nurses were all amazing and so helpful even though I had to pee like 30  a day because of the iv and they had to come help me use the bed pan.

NICUParents,IUGR: Requesting Insight from Others,"Hello NICUParents,

Lots of text, TLDR at the bottom. 

Currently in the middle of mentally processing a recent IUGR diagnosis at 24+6. I'm hoping to get some perspective from those who have been where we are.

Wife had ""unexplained elevated MSAFP"" at about 12 or so weeks, I can't remember.

After that discovery, we had a battery of several tests. We were negative for spina bifida. Our trisomy screens returned normal and were told we are low risk for chromosomal abnormalities. No abnormal nuchal translucency, and no neural tube or abdominal wall defects. Ultrasounds regarding anatomy and visible organ function/development have all appeared normal per MFM staff, aside from baby measuring 2 weeks behind where she should be.

Doctor did mention elevated umbilical dopplers that are worthy of additional observation, but there was still blood flow and there wasn't any backflow. My wife is on a preemptive aspirin and bedrest protocol, but has not officially declared preeclamptic. She has a family history of diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, but is negative for those things herself. 

Baby has remained physically active without issue. We feel her move and kick daily, and she was even moving for us on screen today. The geneticist at our MFM clinic told us that (thus far) due to a lack of observable anomalies on ultrasound, she is leaning more toward a placental issue than chromosomal abnormality.

Even so, my wife and I are still worried to death that something detrimental to our little one's health is hiding under the surface. It has been a very stressful, trying time. We are aware that an early delivery and NICU stay are highly likely, and we are fine with that, as long as she is okay. 

TLDR: For those of you who have had an IUGR baby, were they healthy otherwise, despite their growth restriction? Or did you have other diagnoses alongside the growth restriction?

NICUParents,Told to expect a premature baby and he is already smaller than he should be,"Hi everyone. I don’t know where else to post or if I should post here but cautious baby bumps forwarded me to this subreddit.

I’m currently 25 weeks pregnant with my first baby who was conceived via IVF after years of trying. I’m only 23 years old.

8 days ago, I was having abdominal pain and tightening so headed to labour and delivery. They noted my cervix was closed, however a test they ran came back highly suggestive for preterm labour. They kept me in hospital for a week, giving me steroids for baby’s lungs and monitoring me and I was allowed to come home 2 days ago. 

Today I went for a growth scan and was sadly told baby is only measuring at 23 weeks and 5 days. He also only weighs around 660 grams. At 25 weeks they would expect him to be weighing more.

My OBGYN told me that in ‘normal’ circumstances my pregnancy wouldn’t be too worrying and I’d likely just have a small baby at term, but because he is expected early it is now worrying. 

Another preterm labour test was run and again came back positive. It’s likely I will go into labour within the next week or two if the test wasn’t wrong. I have been told I can have magnesium sulphate if I go into active labour. I’m constantly in pain abdominally but nobody really knows why, so this is just treated with pain killers.

Has anyone got any words of hope at all for me? I’m heartbroken. I saw 25 weeks as such a milestone as I was told most preemies do well after 25 weeks but my little boy isn’t measuring at 25 weeks at all especially with a low weight of 660g.

I hope I’m in the right place.

BabyBumps,How to deal with constant anxiety throughout pregnancy?,"I am currently 13 weeks pregnant with our first baby boy and my fiance and I are so excited! We had to postpone our wedding due to the coronavirus so finding out we were expecting has really been a silver lining for us through all the wedding stress. The problem is, I have had crippling anxiety throughout my whole pregnancy since the day I found out. Although I love reddit and find it to be super helpful I also found that during pregnancy it can be a dark hole. I am constantly reading terrifying stories of women miscarrying, etc and it only fuels my anxiety. Everyday I am afraid the baby has passed and I just don't know it yet. 

All my ultrasounds have been great, baby is growing on track and heartbeat is always strong. Our NIPT can back low risk for everything (that a NIPT tests for) and our NT scan was great, baby looked healthy and normal. But still, everyday I fear I will miscarry or that something is seriously wrong with my baby.

I find myself literally spending hours on the internet sometimes researching very rare complications that can occur during pregnancy and convince myself that it will happen to me. 

Now that i've passed my NT scan I am terrified that at my anatomy scan that we will find something horribly wrong about the baby and I cant stop thinking about it. 

Anyways, I guess i'm wondering, have other future mommas felt this way and how did you deal? Am i ever in the clear to feel excited and attached to my baby? Do all signs point to me having a healthy baby boy in October?

BabyBumps,In the hospital 18.5 weeks pregnant recovering from brain surgery.,"These past few days have been the absolute scariest days of my life and I just need to talk and share with other moms.
I am 18.5 weeks pregnant and since week 12 ish I’ve had terrible headaches. I called my OB twice who has helped a ton with meds and just trying to get me through that second trimester headache wave. Thursday afternoon it was so bad no meds were helping and I could barely see. My OB sent me to labor and delivery triage and after giving meds with no improvement decided to do an MRI just Incase.
Within an hour I was told I had three brain aneurysms one 14mm long that was already leaking and was rushed my ambulance to our university hospital neurological ICU and in brain surgery within hours.
I don’t remember much I just remember being so scared for my baby boy and begging for them to make him safe.
After a 5 hour surgery everything is fixed went perfectly and I’ve been able to see him on an US and listen to his heart tones five times a day since. 
I am so thankful I caught it in time. He was kicking so much before I went under anesthesia it’s something I’ll never forget. I felt like he was just telling me “we got this mom” I just can’t believe we’ve been through so much together already. He’s so damn tough😭
Our bodies are seriously miraculous. Thanks for letting me share, alone in the hospital and just wanted to talk💙

All these messages have brought so much light to these terrible few days I really appreciate you guys giving me the space to share some not so joyful news on this forum and get it out. Joyful now but for sure not easy to read or hear. I knew out of anyone you guys would understand my fear and just overall stress more than anyone.

BabyBumps,HR Manager called the Doctor,"I was diagnosed with an insufficient cervix about a month ago at 26 weeks. My doctor sent me to a specialist to get a second opinion who confirmed that I am at risk for preterm delivery.  


I just had a follow up with my doctor Friday where he asked me about my activity and was surprised to hear that I am still working full time. My job isn’t super strenuous but I am constantly getting up and walking around all day and it’s exhausting. He immediately wrote me a doctors note that it is his medical recommendation that I start working from home starting at the end of August. My particular job cannot be done at home but there are many side projects that the company needs done that I can work on from a laptop.  

I have been very forthcoming with HR about all of this and they let me know that even if there are no work from home options, that I can start short term disability early. Today my nurse called me and said she has a voicemail from my HR manager asking for an exact medical reasoning behind me needing to work from home. She said of course that she cannot give out this information because of HIPPA and that she was very surprised that an HR manager asked to begin with considering its not really allowed? I feel like an HR manager should know about HIPPA and I feel like calling was a huge invasion of privacy. I gave her a note and I even explained the insufficient cervix to her! It’s not like I’ve been shady about any of this.  

My nurse is amazing and said that she won’t even tell my HR manager that we spoke and will just tell her point blank that she is not going to release that information.

BabyBumps,Just Learned I'm Pregnant – At 30 - 36 Weeks!,"Hello! I learned last week that I (31 F) am not only pregnant, but 3rd trimester pregnant! I've seen 3 doctors and been given 3 different possible due dates. 

Some background info: I have had PCOS since puberty, so my periods have always been irregular. I have (had) been on birth control for the last 4 years or so. I was diagnosed with lupus in November 2019. All of these factors combined led me to misjudge, ignore, or misappropriate symptoms of pregnancy! In fact, what led me to see a doctor was that I felt a ""mass"" in my abdomen and I was concerned that it might be a large ovarian cyst, or possibly even a tumor. She sent me for a CT scan, but thankfully they did a weak x-ray first and we saw an unmistakable upside-down little skeleton inside of me!

My boyfriend and I are finally getting over the initial shock, but now that I know I have a lot of sadness. I've been pregnant this entire year and I did not know! Thankfully I neither drink nor smoke, but I have so much guilt about ""neglecting"" my baby, not to mention having x-rayed her!! (The radiologist assured me the amount was fine, especially because of how far along I am.)

The earliest estimation of my due date is August 21st (!!!), based off of ultrasound measurements, and the latest is in the beginning of October,  based off the last period I remember. I've read up on it, and late term ultrasound estimations can be off by up to 30 days if there are no others to compare them to! Being so far along, it seems impossible to narrow down this TWO MONTH window! 

We are preparing for the August date, just in case, (baby shower in two weeks, scrambling to turn BF's office into a nursery), but I'm praying to the universe that she stays in until at least late September.

It is extremely stressful and sad not to know when my baby is coming, how far along I am, and to have missed at least 6 months of joyful expectation! To be dealing with Covid-19 restrictions on top of all this... 

I would really appreciate any words of wisdom, advice, comments, help, anything. Thanks for your time!",540,179,25/07/2020,weeks pregnant,382,POST,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,I have/had an IUD pregnancy and need advice,"Update: hcg levels have dropped again to 67. I'm going back tomorrow to test again to ensure they keep falling now. Quite disappointed but guess it's not meant to be. Thank you to everyone for all your support and kind words. 



Hello, hoping someone can help put me out of my misery. My (33f) husband (46m) and I have two children and thought we were done. I have had the mirena IUD since our 2 year old was born. 

My last menstrual period was early-mid August, but a week after it ended I started spotting and have been since. Hubs and I had sex 28th August. This past Tuesday I woke with cramping that felt unusual, I thought something was wrong with my mirena but thought I would take a home pregnancy test to rule it out. Shock horror it was positive. Initially I was horrified,  thought my family was complete but have since come to believe if this ends up being viable we will be thrilled. 

Went to the hospital for bloods, hcg level was 99. Went back thursday and levels are 85. Which I think means this is unviable? I have to go back saturday for another test to see if they continue to fall. 

My question being, is this a definite miscarriage? Is a slight fall definitely a miscarriage? The spotty stopped yesterday and I feel fine otherwise. Is there a chance this could be visble or do i need to resign myself to this not happening? This is our last (surprise) shot as hubby just had a vasectomy a week ago (typical luck for us). 

Also will the iud need to be removed? 

And on the off chance this pregnancy continues, is removing the iud or leaving it in better medically?

BabyBumps,Apparently I am being oversensitive & need to calm down - according to a man in my office.,"Okay, I need to rant really quick. I have this male coworker who thinks he knows everything. Since I announced I was pregnant (I am 18wks but just told work 2wks ago), he always has something to say. From""You shouldn't rub your belly because it will cause premature labor"" (Cue eye roll) or ""You really shouldn't have juice (I was drinking apple juice) because it is not good for the baby"" or, my favorite, ""Are you really eating again?"", as I am having some watermelon as a snack. 

Keep in mind, he is a 6'8 tall, 250lb MAN.....so yeah.

So today, I was talking to my coworker about some medical issue I THOUGHT I having, (turns out I am okay, but didn't know it at the time) &  while in her office and mid-sentence (almost in tears), he barges in, cuts me off & starts speaking to her about something else. When I said ""Okay, I guess I wasn't speaking..."" He said ""Oh you are always talking, stop being so oversensitive"". 

At that point, I walked out of the office. He said something while I was walking away then followed me to the kitchen, where I was attempting to compose myself, & he was saying in a joking tone how I am over sensitive. All his little comments over the past two weeks bubbled over & I just snapped & told him I was speaking to her about my medical issues, it was kind of important & I don't understand while he is always so rude to me - to that he repeated ""What medical issues, stop...you are so sensitive, calm down."" & walked out.

I am livid. I just know he is going to try & joke around later in the day about something to smooth things over, but this time, I am not going to allow it. 

WHY DO PEOPLE THINK IT IS OKAY TO SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THIS? 

This is going to be a long 6 months before maternity leave...Argh. Okay, rant over.

BabyBumps,Terrified FTM with expected super preemie,"TLDR: 27 weeks with an indefinite hospital stay and baby due to be delivered any time. 

I'm currently 27+6 and absolutely terrified. My pregnancy has brought on diabetes related kidney disease. Before pregnancy the kidneys were functioning in the high 90s and no concern at all. They've drastically gone downhill and are now functioning in the 20s.

I went to what I thought was just a routine appointment with a specialist about this last Tuesday and they discovered that my blood pressure had suddenly skyrocketed. I was given medication to bring it down but this didn't work and the doctor decided the best course of action would be to admit me.

I was told that I now also have pre eclampsia and will be staying in the hospital until the baby is born. The doctor said that mothers who are normal get to this stage and have to deliver within 7-14 days and expects me to deliver in less, when my body gives out. I've been given steroids to help develop baby's lungs. 

Baby was measuring slightly on the small side at around 800g on Wednesday and I'm so scared that I'm going to lose her. She was supposed to be my miracle after two losses this year. I'm doing everything I can to remain calm so my stress doesn't harm my BP but honestly it's a nightmare. I'm on a high observation ward where new mums are brought after having their lovely healthy baby and seeing them interacting and knowing that even if baby is delivered safely I won't have that with her as she'll be whisked away is just about killing me.

I don't know why I'm posting this, if I'm looking for advice or just needed to get this all off my chest but thank you so much if you managed to read the whole of my long ramble.",113,44,28/12/2020,preemie,312,POST,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,"Four weeks pregnant; first ultrasound which finished up after-hours, tech had radiologist read it immediately, was told I need to call my doctor “ASAP” tomorrow. What are the reasons for something like that?","UPDATE: Doc called me this morning and said to come in immediately. Though, I’m not sure why, as it’s more hurry up and wait. I’m 4 weeks approximately, and they’re not seeing a baby anywhere. No fetal pole, gestational sac, or yolk sac. My endometrium lining is 12mm, which was described as “thick”. I also have a hemorrhagic cyst on my right ovary, which is 17x12mm. 

As another update... The report states: 17x12mm complex cystic structure with low level internal echoes right adnexum. Vascularity along peripheral margin without internal septation or vascularity.

Hi all.

Gender: F  
Height: 5’8
Weight: 140lbs  
Health conditions: Pregnant, 4 weeks approximately. 
Thyroid issues (hypo)  
Never smoker  
Location: California and reproductive system  
  
As title states, I went in for my first ultrasound today. It was to see if the Mirena IUD had dislodged, but the tech said it wasn’t there. Must have expelled it.  
  
However, she spent a lot of time imaging my right side with a transvaginal wand. When she finished, she asked me to stay put. She came back after about 15 minutes; said told me she had to have the radiologist read it immediately. She said the radiologist said I could go home, but call my doctor ASAP in the morning.  
  
What would be *possible* reasons for this? I understand it would all be speculative for my circumstance, but there must be some emergencies that require an immediate read but not immediate care. Can anyone detail what those could be? My mind is stuck on ectopic and some kind of mass/cancer.

BabyBumps,Feeling really depressed because my sisters don't seem to care at all about my pregnancy.,"I've been delaying my announcements because my stepsister had her wedding recently and I didn't want to steal her thunder or whatever.

My mom was pushing me to do them anyways because my mom flat out said she doesn't care about my stepsister's wedding and she wants to be able to talk about my baby. I ignored her because I really didn't want to be that person.

I told my actual sister before the wedding to get my mom off my nuts and because she's in from out of town and I figured her feelings would be hurt if she found out on facebook. This sister had the decency to at least act a little excited and is planning on sending all her baby stuff that she doesn't need anymore back with my parents for christmas.

Today we had an outing with my stepsisters and my mom. My mom pushed me to tell them because one of them is also out of town. The one sister had noticed I wasn't drinking at the wedding and basically said ""yea I figured"". And kind gave a half assed ""I'm happy for you.""

The other stepsister literally said NOTHING. And literally didn't speak directly to me the entire day. 

I've never been super close to these woman and I've always kind o of been a black sheep in my family. I didn't go to college, I don't have a ""Career"". But I take care of myself and my husband just fine. These people just don't see me as a responsible adult. They still see me as their stupid little sister that plays video games all day and has no motivations in life.

So I'm not super surprised and I wasn't expecting them to be jumping for joy. But the just really really seem to not give a fuck at all. I have  coworkers that barely know me that are more excited for me than these women that I grew up with and are supposed to be my family.

BabyBumps,Can postpartum depression start during pregnancy?,"I was just wondering if this is possible because I think it's happening to me. Things are not good with the baby's father and it is sending me into a really bad depression. I would seek mental health help but I'm worried that they would call CPS on me. I want to do what's best for me and the baby but I'm scared to draw attention to it. Is this pretty common during pregnancy though?

Edit: I have read all of your comments and I have a doctor's appointment Tuesday. I'm going to bring it up with my doctor and see what she can put me on to help me. As I said, things are not good with the baby's father and I have left him but it has still put me into a depression. He is not the sort of role model that I want in my son's life. His life and his family's life is nothing but chaos and drama and I don't want my son exposed to that. 

Thank you for reassuring me that everything will be fine. I was just worried that if they knew that I was having problems that they would think that I was not fit to be a parent to my son. But I guess it makes sense that if they see me trying to get help before he's even born that it will look good. I only want what's best for him.

I’ve done some retail in the past but would like to remain in an office setting, I just haven’t interacted with the general public for a living since I started here as everything is security clearance for HIPPA (which I’m also HIPPA certified) so I guess I would like some guidance.

This is definitely not what I need as of now and I've been very clear to him about needing someone to support me in this process as I have literally no one except for him. I'm really leaning more towards keeping the baby but my question is if I can actually be a good mother to my child if I've been struggling with my emotions (thoughts of suicide) and happiness for so long?

BabyBumps,How long was your induced labor? Also a few other induction questions!,"I'm getting super nervous about everything. My appointment to figure out ""go time"" is on Thursday, and we're supposed to decide a date and game plan and all of that for a 37 week induction, with a C-section as a backup plan depending on how things go. This is supposed to be what's safest for me and baby both with my conditions, but I'm finding a lot of conflicting information. Some people say inductions are twice as painful but twice as fast, some say they were in labor into two days despite all the pitocin in the world. So I'm just curious how other people's went so I can maybe get an idea. I'm the kind of person that calms down when I'm informed on a topic I'm fretting about.

Additionally, how much room do you realistically have when it comes to choosing a date, at least on the hospital side of things? (I know it's ultimately up to the baby, haha.) 11/11 is just a cute date and lines up with the current planned week. Plus that Monday would also make the most sense for my husband to take his time off work, so I'm hoping I'll have some freedom to choose. But of course I'm clueless since I'm a FTM. I really have no idea how any of this works so any experiences you guys would be willing to share would be amazing.

And of course, it's probably asked a million times, but what about induction without an epidural? Depending on my lab results, I may have to go without and I'm freaking out about the pain.

It also doesn't help that this will be the first grandchild on my side of the family which means my sisters can't really offer much baby advice either. I'm so grateful for my MIL and how she's been supportive but sometimes she can come off a little strong. Tbh I think I might be a little bitter because she's not *my* mom.

NICUParents,PPROM at 22+4 with di/di twins,"This morning at 5:45 am my wife bolted out of bed thinking she was peeing the bed. When she got up there was a rush of fluid that made us even more concerned. We called the 24 hour nurse who encouraged us to head into labor and delivery where the doctor confirmed that twin A’s membrane ruptured. 

My wife is having no contractions at this time which seems like the only good news. 

It seems like the plan at this time is to wait until 24 weeks and then be admitted for steroids and antibiotics, but I’m scared that this is a false hope that they only told us to avoid the hard truth. 

We were discharged with instructions to avoid exertion and monitor temperature and be very wary of any early signs of infection. 

We are terrified, we have a call scheduled with the Perinatologist in two hours but we just feel so helpless to protect our babies. 

Reading the internet tells me that the outcomes for our situation are not good. We are at a terrible risk and I’m sort of waiting for the other shoe to drop.

UPDATE:

Thank you for your replies and responses. We had a long call with our perinatal doctor and it was both informative and helpful. The outcomes are scary and we are looking at a long, hard road regardless of what happens. But I also have a lot more hope than I did when I first made this post.

The reasons for not admitting this early were as others have said, it would not demonstrably improve outcomes. We are currently in a waiting game, hoping to avoid labor and infection while we count down to viability. We have an appointment next week to meet with a neonatologist and with the perinatologist to plan our course of action.

Thank you for your thoughts and prayers and for your suggestions to seek a second opinion or go back to the hospital. I can understand where you are coming from and I appreciate that you are all looking out for my wife and my babies' best interests. As of now however we are going to wait it out at home, ready to take a trip to the ER/L&D if anything changes.

BabyBumps,Some very “WTF” things they don’t tell you about pregnancy.,"25 weeks, first-time mom. Here is a list of things that NO ONE bothered to tell me about being pregnant:

1. You haven’t actually stopped peeing until you try it once, stand up, sit down and then pee a second time. Leaving the house without doing this will bring you a world of regret (especially since public restrooms aren’t a thing right now.)

2. Your nipples will leak without telling you and then they will dry, and you’ll look down the next morning and immediately think you have cancer or a rare nipple disease oh my god. 

3. Speaking of nipples, they are permanently erect now and they feel like fire at all times. You can cut glass with them. You are now Andy Bernard in that episode of The Office with the rabies fun-run. 

4. Your baby can, and WILL, kick you square in the butthole from inside the womb. They do not apologize. Do not expect flowers. 

5. First kicks don’t always feel like butterflies or a fun little goldfish. They can also feel like your bladder is trying to off itself one explosion at a time. It will launch you off the couch in a panic and there is nothing you can do about it. 

6. You won’t know where your stomach is anymore now that your organs are all squished around. Your doctor doesn’t know. Your midwife doesn’t know. Nobody fucking knows but you’ll still get reminded that it’s there by the HOT LAVA heartburn that happens if you even THINK about a banana before going to sleep. 

7. Doing the dishes takes three sessions because standing up is impossible for more than two minutes. You will feel like you need an oxygen tank. Or a priest. 

8. Constipation is more difficult than normal because, as you may remember from #6, you don’t know or understand where your organs are anymore. Your body is just trying to poop but your liver and kidneys suddenly have to voice their shitty opinions, as well as whatever the hell is in your ribcage at the moment, and you more than likely will google “AM I DYING?” at four AM. This will happen more than once. 

Have I missed anything? I’m only 25 weeks so I guess I get another full trimester to find out. Pregnancy is such a BEAUTIFUL MIRACLE.

I had such dreams for my life with twins. When they were born so early it all felt like it was crashing down. I had more hope when their brain scans came back clear, all we wanted was for them to be as healthy as possible. Then at 10 days old our son became ill and died hours later. For those of you going through this, I am so sorry, the pain never stops. We miss our boy every day.

My girl continued to get stronger, she had some ups and downs but after 117 days in the NICU we took her home. We were so scared! I can’t believe they just let us leave, I felt so unprepared. She spent the first 3 months on constant low flow oxygen, it was cumbersome but fine. I tripped over an oxygen tube in the middle of the night while holding her and landed on my back by kept holding her in the air, I was bruised but she was fine. After that we did nine months of oxygen as needed.

Now here is the good part. At 2 years old she is beyond our wildest dreams. She is the sweetest, most fun, Intelligent baby you would ever meet. Her doctors marvel at how well she is doing. She is our miracle. I hope yours is too.

Tip: Our NICU did kangaroo care, it’s the real deal, look up the studies. Also at 29 weeks or so they let us pick her up on our own without help and my wife basically never put her down, she was being cuddled and loved on for 16 hours a day, I think this helped her.",62,6,14/04/2020,early labor,342,PRE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Giving birth alone?,"I’m almost 37 weeks. I’ve been in an emotionally abusive relationship throughout my entire pregnancy. It’s super good at times but every once and a while when he loses his temper it gets way out of control. He’s called me fat cow (at 7 months pregnant), ugly bitch, stupid bitch, idiot, cunt, waste of life, he’ll say he doesn’t love me anymore and I never meant anything to him, he tells me he wishes I’d kill myself (while pregnant with his daughter). I’m starting to believe all of it and I’m feeling so scared and unable to leave. He blocks my number constantly when I try to bring anything up, even when I’m in the hospital experiencing different complications and in so much pain he says it’s good I’m in pain and I deserve it. He says I deserve a miserable life and he will do whatever he can to make it that way. He tells me that he’s gonna have my baby taken from me and that he can’t wait to take me to court. I am not on drugs, I am living healthy and devoted my whole life to getting ready for baby, I don’t understand why this is happening. He takes videos of me crying and threatens to use it to show what an unfit mother I am. He has spit in my face and then when I’m sitting there wiping it off crying says “prove I did it, bitch.” He’s grabbed my arms to the point I have bruises and had to go to the hospital where I ended up having a sprained wrist and they documented injury (8 months pregnant).

Recently he told me multiple times that he hopes I die while I’m in labor. I really feel so scared and alone and I don’t get why this is the pregnancy I deserve. I love him so much and I don’t understand how he says he loves me and treats me like such shit. My water has broken once early and I was in preterm labour in the hospital and he wouldn’t come and said he hopes I die there. I had blood come out and contractions all night about two nights ago and he said good he hopes I’m in a lot of pain. I want to involve him so bad because when he’s not mad he’s a good person but I don’t know what to do or if I can even do this alone.

BabyBumps,Baby is in the 99th percentile for size. I feel like a traumatic birth is inevitable and I’m scared.,"Gosh, maybe it’s hormones but I got misty-eyed just writing my post title. 

I’m a FTM, 30w 3d, and my son is enormous. He’s measuring four weeks larger than his gestational age. Over the past few months he’s gone from the 93rd percentile, to the 96th, and now 99th. I was hoping he would slow down but he just keeps getting larger. My OB even sent me to a specialist with one of those fancy 3d ultrasounds, so I don’t think the estimations are off. 

I do not have gestational diabetes or any health condition that would cause this to happen. They even had me do a 3 hour glucose test to be sure, and I passed with flying colors. I guess it’s just genetics. I was 9lbs 6oz. My two cousins were over 10 and over 11 lbs respectively (my aunt does have diabetes and obesity). All of us were delivered vaginally and my mom says I was a smooth delivery. 

But I’m still terrified. I was told by a gynecologist in the past that I have a narrow vagina. So even if my son was not huge, I would be afraid of tearing. It seems inevitable that I’m going to end up with either a 3rd or 4th degree tear, or I’ll have to have a c-section. He also most likely has a double nuchal cord (nearly impossible to detect for sure even with the fancy ultrasound) which means labor will be even more terrifying for me as I will be in fear of my baby’s circulation being cut off. My OB tried to reassure me, said that every situation is different, that some people have no trouble delivering a 10 lb baby vaginally and others have trouble with a 6 lb baby. I don’t know why but I still feel like there’s no way this is going to go well for me.

Since I’m a FTM, I’ve been reading birth stories for months in an effort to better prepare myself. I think the stories are fascinating but it’s not helping my anxiety at all. It also doesn’t help that I’m a medical coding auditor. My profession involves reading only the most complicated medical charts, so when I work on delivery cases I never see the ones that go smoothly. That skewed perspective probably isn’t helping. I’m planning on doing a tour of the hospital’s maternity ward with my husband this month, but I don’t know how much that will help. 

I have 10 weeks to go and I just want to stop being scared. Any advice is very, very appreciated.",30,53,03/01/2020,gestational age,433,PRE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Week 26+4 Update: PPROM at 22+4 with di/di twins (warning: loss),"Original post: https://reddit.com/r/NICUParents/comments/dtltvr/pprom_at_224_with_didi_twins/

First update:
https://www.reddit.com/r/NICUParents/comments/e17uzf/update_pprom_at_224_with_didi_twins_warning_loss/

Hey all, thanks again for sending your love any good wishes and prayers. We are currently at 26 weeks and 4 days this morning and still pregnant with our second daughter.

We are experiencing what the medical community describes as ""delayed interval delivery"" where the birth of the first twin is followed by a period of days or weeks before the delivery of the second twin.

As described in our first update, our first baby girl was lost November 11 and was born on November 12. We have been blessed with almost a month of mostly stable conditions and monitoring since then.

The doctors have been following the general recommended course of action for a PPROM (preterm, pre-labor rupture of membrane) even though our little girl in utero still has intact membranes, she is still at heightened risk of infection. So we have been monitored 3 times a day, temperature, blood pressure and NST monitoring.

On early Thursday morning, baby's heart-rate had a prolonged (6 minute) decel which prompted prolonged monitoring which caught a few, more minor decels which prompted medical interventions. My wife received magnesium infusion for 12 hours and the first shot of the second round of betamethasone. Worth noting that my wife was not feeling contractions; the magnesium was neuroprotective in case they needed to perform an emergency c-section that night. We were also kept on 24 hour monitoring to make sure the decels weren't recurring.

Yesterday was remarkably uneventful and we went from about 3 AM to midnight without any marked decels. Unfortunately this morning around midnight we had another lengthy decel and a second later this morning.

My wife is back on the magnesium, but thankfully it is helping her rest, and we haven't seen any dips for about 5 hours. Rounds should be in the next hour or two, but it's unlikely we will know more afterward.

We are so glad that we have a team of doctors and nurses around us who are looking out for my wife and baby's best interests. Everyone wants this baby to keep gestating as long as possible, but the repeat prolonged decels have everyone on edge.

Was anyone else delivered early, before labor, due to fetal heart rate issues? We met again with a NICU nurse yesterday who explained the basics of reading preemie body language and bonding with LO in the NICU. We'd love to prolong our stay at the most expensive hotel either of us will ever stay at, but if it's best for baby we may be becoming NICU parents sooner than later.",27,6,06/12/2019,preterm birth,435,PRE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Just had my first appointment at a fertility clinic and turns out - I’m already pregnant!!!!,"For the last couple years I’ve had irregular periods, I used to only get them every 6 weeks and now it’s every other month.  My family doctor has never been able to diagnose the reasoning for it and said sometimes women just don’t ovulate for no explained reason and that when I’m ready to start trying, he’ll refer me to a fertility specialist right away.  My fiancé and I decided to start trying at the end of October and my family doc immediately wrote me the referral.

Since then, I’ve been mentally preparing myself for the upcoming struggle ahead and have lost sleep for the past month about it.  The initial ultrasounds and bloodwork are supposed to be done on your period so I’ve been waiting for mine to come and finally Tuesday this week I started to bleed and booked my appointments.  The next day I stopped bleeding and the clinic told me to keep my appointments anyways.  This just made even more upset thinking that the stress I’ve been putting on myself is making my menstrual cycle even more messed up.
 
Today I went in, did my ultrasounds and bloodwork and the OB came to speak to me after and told me I’M ALREADY PREGNANT!!!!!! He said I’m only 4-5 weeks and that it’s still really early but I immediately started sobbing.

For years now I’ve been hating my body for not being “normal” with no unexplainable reason.  I had already prepared myself for the thought of years of trying to conceive and all the medication or procedures I might have to take and just knowing that my body IS ovulating and I’m able to conceive has been the biggest weight ever lifted off my shoulders.  Whether or not I make it to full term I’m just so happy to know that something is working and even though it’s too early to share with friends and family...I had to share this good news with someone who might also be worried their irregular period automatically means infertility.

Any early term advice is greatly appreciated and I’m so excited to be on this journey with all you other women out there!

Update:  I set up cupcakes and a pregnancy announcement on my fiancé’s desk for when he got home.  Worst timing he came home when I was on a video conference call with my work team!! He was jumping and screaming and ran to gave me kisses.  Fortunately I muted and turned my camera off in time.  Ironically enough on the call my colleague shared for the first time that his wife is pregnant and due in the spring. I’m the only female on my team and everyone kept telling me I’m next!  I laughed it off but little do they know I just found out today that I actually am!! It will be funny to tell them later that the same day they told me I’m next, was actually the same day I found out I was pregnant!",1661,187,11/12/2020,pregnancy stress,499,POST,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,"3 weeks ago, found out I was pregnant. Thought I was 6 or 7 weeks at the time. After first ObyGyne app. (4 days ago), found out I was almost 32 weeks pregnant. See comment for more info.","How does this happen you ask?  Well, I was diagnosed with PCOS last year and had doctors telling me if it was normal in my condition to not have a period due to the situation.  I've never had a child before and I work a laborious job that puts my body in low level pain alot.  3 weeks ago, I got to this point where I couldn't understand why I was having to pee all the time and I was taking a new medication that I thought could maybe causing some side effects.

I still had this inkly of thought to think about pregnancy and finally just randomly said to my husband ""Hey, would you mind if I took a rapid pregnancy test?  I don't want to just get one and have you freak out on me if you find me doing it and it's just to dispell some concerns.  I honestly don't think I'm pregnant"".

He nicely bullied me then to get the test and late that night I get a surprise positive test reading.  Husband gently freaks and has a mini internal crisis (new daddy thoughts).  I then got into my primary to take a blood test following day and on Columbus day, got positive results with estimate of 6 to 7 weeks.

I then struggled and filled out fifty billion forms to get into an obygyne clinic that wasn't able to see me until 2 weeks following.  When I get in, the pandemic forced me to go alone and I, again, was expecting something unexpected I just got blown out of the water.

The woman goes to plunk the wand inside me, then takes it out and really quickly changes to the sonogram.  This is when I get told ""So you think you are around 10 weeks hun? .....Well you're actually more than that"".

""Okay.....how much more?""

""Ohh...I'd say around 28 or 29 weeks...""

....I start hyperventilating and Ohmygodding and she had to spend 5 to 10 minutes talking me into a calmer state.  Baby seems to have strong heart beat and she told me baby looks good.  The next room I get pulled into I get told I'm actually 31 weeks and 4 days estimate.

Long story short, my husband and I thought we'd have many many more months to prepare and now we have less than 8 weeks to get everything ready for the little firecracker coming in hot into our lives.  We are happy, we are just scared.  

So with that, do any of you have nice suggestions on baby items I may need that I wouldn't think of?  I'm trying to compile from baby registry on Amazon but I'm worried there may be secret amazing needs that I have no time to thoroughly learn or get in the ""know"" about.  I appreciate any suggestions!

BabyBumps,"Why is it expected/acceptable that women will suffer through pregnancy without treatment for ailments, compromising their own health and well-being, just for the sake of the fetus?","I’m about 8 weeks pregnant and already at my wits end. I’ve taken issue with women’s healthcare in the US for a long time, but the treatment of women during pregnancy is by far the worst. 

This is a planned pregnancy, and I understood in advance that pregnancy is just one of the millions of sacrifices a mother will make for her child. However, I have a sneaking suspicion that if men were the ones who carried a pregnancy, the first-line treatment for debilitating pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting would not be an OTC sedative + vitamin B in the year 2020. That sounds more like a treatment for hysteria in 1820. 

I take several medications normally for asthma, allergies, and acid reflux. MD has advised that she will generously “allow” me to continue taking my asthma medication, but has advised me to stop the others — “heartburn and allergies may make you uncomfortable for a few months, but it’s a small price to pay to have a healthy baby.” As for the nausea? “Ginger and crackers are best.” I’ve lost 7 lbs in 2 weeks, and I was only 110 lbs at baseline. I hardly think that malnutrition and dehydration can be better for the developing fetus than a fucking Prilosec in the morning to keep acid reflux at bay. 

Right now, the “baby” is little more than a blueberry-sized parasite that is feeding off me, but I should be treated as the patient. If I choose to consider the implications of my own treatment on that of a tentative fetus, then that’s my choice to make, just like a patient may cross-reference a recommended treatment against their religious or social preferences. 

My fury is perhaps intensified by the fact that I have a PhD in pharmacology and am well aware of what evidence exists — or doesn’t exist — regarding adverse effects of each medication on a developing fetus.  I wouldn’t take Accutane or tetracycline while pregnant, but the theoretical risk a Claritin tablet poses to the developing fetus is a chance I’m willing to take. When I confronted the MD about the supposed evidence (I was told metoclopramide is a teratogen, which it is not) her only defense was that maybe it doesn’t say in the literature that it’s a teratogen but she has “seen it many times over the years.” Oh really? 😂 So this MD established a causal relationship between metoclopramide and birth defects, purely based on her own anecdotal case studies and observations? I wonder if she got IRB approval for this study. 

The treatment of women, and especially pregnant women, in this country is antiquated and quite frankly disgusting.",839,344,24/08/2020,week of birth,445,POST,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Do IUGR babies tend to do worse when born early?,"Hi again everyone. I asked something similar the other day but just feel as though I need to arm myself with more info.

I’m in hospital yet again due to contractions. So far only every 15 minutes and docs aren’t sure if it is my bowels playing around (I suffer from IBS and the pain sometimes resembles contractions but we cannot take any chances with recent events). I’m pretty sure it won’t be long now until baby makes his appearance, sadly I am only 25 weeks and 4 days. I’m grateful however that we made it this far - I was previously told I’d deliver at 23 weeks and 4 days. 

A few days ago, we had a growth scan and boy was measuring about 7 days behind where he should be. He was in the 50th percentile for a baby at 24 weeks, and the 17-20th percentile for a baby of his age (25 weeks)

They couldn’t tell me why. My placenta function is normal. It’s all been very worrying.

Husband and I were disheartened as we always assumed if we got to 25 weeks he’d have a better chance. In the leaflet our NICU gave us, they state most babies born after 25 weeks survive if they have had magnesium and steroids. He has had both (currently at it with the magnesium anyway)

I was then told by a pretty unsupportive family member yesterday (who has had three full term babies) that because our boy technically isn’t the size of a 25 weeker his chances are lower. However, I’ve read a few comments on this subreddit and google where preemie parents have been told its more gestational age that matters rather than baby’s measurements on percentile charts from ultrasounds. I actually spoke to one mom who said that preemies who are small for gestational age have usually put their energy more towards organ development so they often fair well.

Little dude has definitely been in there for 25 weeks and 4 days. We can’t explain his small size away by confused conception dates because he is an IVF baby. 


Has anyone here got any hope for us? I’m feeling desperately sad again tonight. It’s never ending.. I’m in the UK and have also been told tonight that they don’t give drugs to ‘hold off’ labour here as it isn’t in their policy. They only give drugs to stall labour so they can transport the woman to a NICU. I’m currently waiting to be transported YET AGAIN but the only thing I’ve been given is magnesium. Is this supposed to stall labour??",21,11,01/02/2020,born early,433,PRE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Worst doctors experience & emotional aftermath,"I went to a different OB than my regular one today due to them having better ultrasound equipment and my little girl being very stubborn. I was put into an 80° room and poked and prodded for over an hour and a half for the scan, which was fine but uncomfortable. The doctor seemed short but pleasant the whole time. 

As soon as we’re done, the doctor first makes a comment making fun of me for being sweaty. Then she starts going in on me about being overweight, and how I have sugar/high blood pressure. Which I do not, and she did not bother checking my labs or charts obviously as both have been tested and perfect. She then says it’s good that I was so sick in the first trimester and lost 40 lbs, and to keep it up. Then, she tells me that if my baby Is stillborn it’s my fault for being overweight and that I shouldn’t have gotten pregnant while overweight (I was told I was infertile, this was not a planned pregnancy) and that I better breastfeed to help me lose weight (I’m not, I have trauma regarding my breasts). She wraps up the conversation saying she hopes I keep this in mind before getting pregnant again. 

I had tears in my eyes, my husband is slack jawed at the audacity, and as soon as we got into the car I started bawling. I literally haven’t been able to stop crying and it’s been 5 hours. I’m hungry but I’m so disgusted with myself that my body is rejecting food. 

I’ve struggled with depression/anxiety this whole pregnancy and went through lots of trauma during it too. I’ve worked my ass off to try to have a healthy pregnancy, and btw my baby is PERFECT AND HEALTHY she even said so. I’m just so terrified of being an awful mom. Now I can’t shake the feeling that I’m already failing my baby and she’s gonna die because of me. 

I read the reviews on this office on google and they have 1 Star reviews for the same thing. They do this to all women, and they’re a high risk OB. If my normal OB (who is great) tries to send me there I will flat out refuse. 

Now I gotta try to recover the steps of my mental health. I had been doing better lately but feel like I’m at rock bottom again. I can’t get out of bed, I can’t eat, I can’t stop crying.

BabyBumps,Has anyone dealt with an extreme amount of stress / grief during early pregnancy?,"I will be 12 weeks pregnant tomorrow. A few weeks ago my MIL died after a long battle with cancer. It was awful, but we knew she was approaching the end of her life and she was very at peace with it so we were managing our grief pretty well. 

Last Sunday, my FIL wasn't answering his phone so we went over to his place to check on him, where we found him unresponsive. I did CPR but he was already dead. Suspected massive heart attack, but I know he really died of a broken heart. He died 17 days after his wife, meaning my husband and his sister lost both their parents less than three weeks apart.

My husband is devastated and my heart is absolutely broken for him. I adored his parents so I'm grieving them hard myself.

On top of all this, also during my first trimester: 


- My SIL (husband's sister), who was my 'pregnancy buddy' because she was 6 weeks ahead of me, had a miscarriage two days before her mom died. I've been grieving the loss of having our babies grow up 6 weeks apart 


- We discovered that my husband is a carrier for a very serious genetic condition. We found out last week that I'm NOT a carrier (small win!!) so the band will be fine on that front, but we've been stressing out about it for weeks


- My own mom (who has destroyed her pancreas with 20 years of heavy drinking) relapsed after 7 months sober the day of my 8-week ultrasound. I'm afraid she's going to drink herself to death. 


All of that baseline grief/worry probably isn't good for the baby, but I'm also concerned that the absolute trauma and horror of finding my dead FIL and having to perform CPR on him (I can still hear the sound of his ribs breaking under my hands) was enough of a shock to the system to hurt the baby.

Has anyone been through an absolutely horrible time during pregnancy and ended up with a happy, healthy baby at the end? I can find articles on the effects of general stress during pregnancy but this shit is next level.

And yes, I'll be looking for a grief counsellor for both myself and my husband this week. He's handling it as well as can be expected (and I think I'm doing pretty well too) but I have a history of depression and this feels like a recipe for PPD waiting to happen, so I want to get in front of it!",37,18,17/08/2020,pregnancy stress,429,POST,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Gestational Hypertension?,"Hi all, I’m wondering if any of you who were diagnosed with gestational hypertension without preeclampsia ended up experiencing in regards to prenatal treatment and labor. 

I have a history of severe preeclampsia with my first pregnancy (born 30+5), and despite having normal bp with my second (born 35+1) I was induced for a headache and put on magnesium for labor; in hindsight, I should have pushed back against that, as my headache ended up being due to a back injury. I am currently 35+6 and watching my bp rise over the last few days, though there’s an anxiety component that’s exacerbating it. I have no protein spillage, all bloodwork is good, no headaches or other pre-e symptoms. My bp was 128/89 this am but has been as high as 147/96 (but with a pulse of 111 bpm) in the past 24 hours. I’m on baby aspirin and Wellbutrin, no other meds. 

My anxiety component comes from going into L&D on Monday to get asymmetrical foot swelling checked out. Being there definitely triggered some ptsd and the nurses made it worse by telling me they were going to put me on magnesium sulfate and induce me before even talking to my doctor about it. My bp numbers were very high (145/98 to 150/110), but my pulse was 155+ the whole time so it wasn’t just GH raising my bp - I was very open with them that I was having severe anxiety during the whole experience. My doctor intervened and shut them down, and was upset that the nurses told me what they did. She had me discharged after getting checked for a blood clot in my leg. I saw her the next day and she was satisfied with my bp in the office (128/90) though not thrilled. She is not the doctor that induced me with #2. I’ve been having serious anxiety ever since and am waiting to hear back from my doctor about getting medication to calm me down. Looking at my blood pressure cuffs starts a physical panic response at this point. It’s really frustrating and embarrassing. I feel like I’m sabotaging my own pregnancy outcomes. 

I would love to hear from anyone who has had a similar experience. Especially whether or not they put you on magnesium for labor, did labetalol, or prescribed any meds for acute anxiety. Trying to mentally prepare myself for another induction, but would like to advocate for keeping this baby cooking as long as possible. And I would love to avoid mag this time around, is that a thing that they give patients with only GH and no other preeclampsia symptoms?

AskDocs,heart rate 160 +," 

White female, 163, 70 kilos (currently 6 months pregnant), non smoker. Dad suffers from bradychardia- and has a pacemaker (fitted when he was 55). Uncle passed away at 50 from a heart attack in his sleep.

2 years ago I suffered from anxiety and stress. I remember waking up at the time with my heart rate shooting up (then found out it was going 160 + when it happened), sweating, feeling dizzy. I went to the ER who did tests such as EKG, XRAY etc and said that the heart rate was fast but regular- and said it was anxiety related. One EKG done at the GP surgery came back as atrial flutter so I went back to hospital- the consultant again said that the GP read it wrong because the heart rate was so fast but that it was totally regular and fine. I decided to trust her- she gave me beta blockers that I never used. I decided to work on my anxiety as a result and got better.

My heart rate can still shoot up to 160 if I'm panicked- so anytime a nurse or GP takes my pulse, if I have to do public speaking, etc. It comes back down nicely as soon as I breathe and calm down. Some nurses freak out and say this is REALLY high to just be anxiety related- but then see I went to hospital etc so just leave it.

My slight worry is that I noticed that my heart rate was 176 going up stairs (they are quite steep), when it was 110 when I was walking (quite fast). Is this normal? Again, the heart rate drops back down quickly and nicely within minutes. No chest pain experienced. Am I just out of shape then?

I also noticed that my heart rate went from 90 to 120 just standing up- not sure how much I trust my fitbit but could it be PTOS? None of the GPs mentioned it to me.

I'm currently pregnant with my first baby and was assured by the midwives that it would be fine during labour- my main worry was around the epidural and whether my heart could cope with this? and cope with labour in general? I'm just worried it will be crazy high and that they will give me an emergency c section as a result?

Thanks a lot for reading and for your input- again I have been reassured by the medical staff who look after my pregnancy but was curious to get opinions from doctors on here too. As you can see in my family history my dad's side have had heart related issues so want to be on the safe side.",8,5,10/02/2020,stress during pregnancy,452,PRE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Why I'll never see another midwife,"My first child was born at 41 weeks. She was estimated to be 7 lbs and was born at 8lbs1oz. I had a natural unmedicated birth that ended in a 3rd degree tear and significant blood loss. It was horrific and traumatic for me. My recovery was significantly more difficult than any of my friends who had c sections. 

With this pregnancy, I have gestational diabetes. Baby has been consistently measuring large for gestational age. His size has been estimated 3x by ultrasound. His belly is measuring above the 99th percentile. I am terrified of delivering a large baby and have been begging for a c section.

My high risk doctor said I am not to go past 39 weeks because of the risk of my placenta failing. There are two midwives and two OBs at the regular practice I go to. One of the midwives told me that I absolutely could not have a c section unless the baby was measuring over 10 lbs. She also tried to convince me that I didn't have to listen to the high risk doctor and that I could go to 40 weeks. She didn't listen to any of my concerns.

On Monday at 36+6 I saw the second OB for the first time. At this point, baby is estimated at around 8 lbs. We went over the risks plus my fears and concerns. He recommended induction at 38+0 and felt it was the best option for me. He told me that I was free to wait until 39 weeks if I really wanted to and that he would recommend a c section at that point based on how my previous birth went, but he said that ultimately it was my decision. Now he is going to deliver my baby instead.

I saw the other midwife today, who I usually see, and she acted mad that the OB scheduled an induction for me at 38+0. She said she would have been ok with me going to 39 weeks. I told her that I was happy about the induction and explained why I thought it was a good idea. She still acted mad at him about it, said she would not have recommended that, and offered to reschedule my induction. I said no.

One of the midwives has completely ignored my concerns, the other has ignored my concerns and made potentially dangerous suggestions that go against what the high risk Dr said was necessary.

I will never again see another midwife. I'll be seeing this OB from here on out, including for my future annual visits. I have felt so ignored and like they didn't see me as an individual with individual medical history and needs.

I feel much safer and relieved now that I am having an early induction and am delivering with a dr who listens to me.",129,90,17/07/2020,gestational age,476,POST,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,"Need to vent, but know ITA...","I’m a FTM due with a little baby girl at the end of November. Husband and I are over the moon, despite the difficulties of pregnancy during COVID, plus a scary false T21 positive on NIPT at 13 weeks. 

My sister-in-law (husband’s sis) was supposed to get married in May in Hawaii (we live in CA), but we all know how that turned out. I was supposed to be her MOH, and I was super pumped. 

Wedding has now been moved to... end of October. So, I will be 35 weeks and unable to fly out to Hawaii. Of course, I’m bummed. I’m so so happy for her, but I am sad and a little salty at this damn virus for messing everything up.  

The vent? My husband and his entire family (essentially my whole support system) will be gone. My mom lives far away and we have a tenuous relationship. Plus, my husband wants me to minimize my time with her, as she heightens my anxiety. Same thing with my aunt who lives in my area. So I will effectively be alone 4 weeks till my due date taking care of our 2 dogs (and I’m a bit worried the travelers will ask me to drive around and care for theirs as well). 

I am SO anxious about this. What if I go into premature labor? What if I end up being on bed rest or needing help? Meanwhile my husband and his family will be living it up in Hawaii at the Grand Wailea, sliding down water slides and going to luaus. I want them to have a good time and I don’t fault them, but I am SALTY. I requested (to my husband) that they don’t send me any pics of them all having fun, as it will likely only make me cry and feel lonely. I don’t mind wedding pics or videos, but vacation pics while I’m stuck at home?? No thanks. 

My husband is so upset at me for feeling this way. “Why do you have to look at it like that?? Why can’t you just be happy for everyone? You don’t HAVE to be upset about it.” I just want him to understand that I will be a little sad and lonely when my whole support system will be thousands of miles away when I am at the tail end of my pregnancy. 

Don’t get me wrong. I don’t begrudge my SIL, and I do want her to have the wedding of her dreams. I want my husband to be there for his little sister. But I am sad and scared and I will be a little salty that I have to be alone. I wish I could be a serene and selfless person who is only happy for them, but it’s really really hard. And now I feel like a spiteful bitch because of all this. 

Thanks for reading that long rant. Needed to get that out. :)",39,59,03/07/2020,premature baby,495,POST,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,"Overdue, false labor, broken boundaries","I’m 40 + 3 today. since 1 in the morning i have been stuck in false labor. this is the second time this has happened. i thought it was real & around 9 this morning i realized it was prodromal labor, just like what happened to me around 37/38 weeks.

i got pissed off and felt defeated. i’m tired of fucking dealing with this. i don’t know why my body just won’t fucking work.

when i realized it was false labor again, i told everyone to stay home & not come by. what the fuck is the point of them coming by? especially when i’m pissed off & MAJORLY upset (this pretty much cements that i’m going to be needing to be induced- that’s a post for a different day though).

i come from a really tight family. my mom is my best friend and my sisters + brothers are the only people i consistently talk to everyday (obviously besides my husband lol).

i told my mom to tell everyone not to come by anymore. it’s not real labor, there is no reason for them to stop by. i’m in pain and the pain isn’t doing shit fuck to get my baby here. i slept for four hours, broken up by having to get out of the bed to pee three different times.

they showed the fuck up anyways. i told them they weren’t respecting my fucking boundaries & there was no reason for them to be here. i’ve been in false labor for 11 hours, i haven’t slept, i’m cranky, i’m devastated- i need to be left ALONE. & you wanna know what these fuckers had the audacity to say?! “sorry we care” —shut the fuck up if y’all actually gave a fuck about me / my well being / my mental health, then you would RESPECT MY GODDAMN BOUNDARIES. i said don’t fucking come over, so when you show up on my fucking doorstep anyways- adamant that i’m in labor, & then basically tell me i don’t know anything about what’s going on in MY body- i’m gonna get pissed the mother fuck off. i told them they can find out when the baby is here through facebook since they don’t want to respect my boundaries & then BLAME me when i’m not down for pleasantries.

& now everyone is looking at me like i’m the psycho bitch because i freaked the mother fuck out. they’re all mad at me now.

fuck everything about today. & fuck my body for going into false labor TWICE, once while overdue. this shit makes me wanna drink a gallon of fucking castor oil.


ETA: they also said “well we came to support you like you support us in labor” & i said thats fucking different because YOU. WERE. IN. CONFIRMED. LABOR. IN. THE. FUCKING. HOSPITAL.

I AM IN CONFIRMED FALSE LABOR. LEAVE ME ALONE.",15,13,13/09/2020,overdue,483,POST,,,,,,,,,,,,,
