BabyBumps,34+6 preterm birth‚Äîtraumatic right now but will be okay. Our sweet Jude has arrived and I may be transported to his hospital today!,"Yesterday morning at about this time (4:50 am EST) I woke up to cramping in my back that I noticed was very regular, around 7 minutes apart, and sometimes down my legs. I had irritable uterus so I just convinced myself that‚Äôs all it was. My dad was over helping me with my 2.5 year old son because I‚Äôve been on bedrest trying to keep that second little boy inside longer for the last three weeks. Around 8:45 my dad finally convinced me I should call my doctor and give them a heads up. They gave me an hour and a few home remedies to try before calling back. Nothing worked so I called back at 10am and they said head to L&D to be safe. I threw a few more ‚Äúmight want it‚Äù things in my hospital bag ‚Äújust in case‚Äù still not actually believing this was serious and that I was just being dramatic. Ha. Dumb me. Dad drops me off at the hospital (husband is the only allowed visitor and he‚Äôs a nurse practitioner so was finishing rounds before coming because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs nothing he‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Hahahaha. Nope. Big fat jokes on us.

I‚Äôve been timing in my head because I‚Äôm a genius but by the time I was checked in and in triage I was contracting three minutes apart not five like I thought and they were getting pretty Uncomfortable. Midwife and nurse both checked me and told me I was in labor for real and they were going to start the meds to stop it. We started with two doses of procardia very close together and me drinking insane amounts of water. Nope. Contractions now 2 minutes apart and sometimes doubling up. Got a shot of turbutaline (not sure if that‚Äôs spelled right) and steroids in my leg to try to take the next serious step. That didn‚Äôt work at all either. Sometime in between procardia and the shots my husband showed up but I can‚Äôt remember when. We realize about thirty minutes after the shot that shit is getting real and things are NOT GOOD at this point because we know we have a white male baby in there and as premies they struggle. I have full blown panic attack. At this point ‚Äújust in case‚Äù they brought me consent forms for everything. I had chosen not to VBAC which turned out great because my dilation was extremely painful and sporadic due to massive scar tissue from a poorly inserted IUD in my twenties. I don‚Äôt remember dilation at the end of this. It became a blur of fear.

I think at about 3:15 the OB came in with the midwife and they decided to give me morphine as a very last ditch effort to calm my body down and at least buy us until the next day because every single day counts. The morphine made it so I could be calm during breaks from contractions (aka be high off my ass and somehow no one thought to take my phone away so there‚Äôs embarrassing shit in there) but there was no change in spacing and they were doubling up nearly every time. So the call was made, baby wasn‚Äôt waiting and this was happening now. I did okay with this right up until we got into the OR when I suddenly had flashbacks to my first son‚Äôs c section in which I bled out, lost consciousness, and didn‚Äôt wake up for twelve hours. Absolutely lost my shit. But my nurse and the CRNA were so so so kind. They placed my spinal block and hugged me tight until I was ready to lay down and just let me sob until I was calm. Everyone through all of this has been incredible. 

The best surprise to happen during all of this‚Äîin walks my husband in his own PPE from work!!! He talked to the OB, they talked to his boss, and he got special permission to be in the OR in the restrictions currently placed because of his job and because he had full sterile PPE in his car with him from working two doors down from the hospital in a hospital facility. Huge huge huge relief. It was awful preparing to deliver a very early baby alone.

The c section went beautifully and they honored my request without hesitation to tie and burn and partially remove my tubes (see my post history‚ÄîI suck at being pregnant). I was awake the whole time and I got to hear his beautiful cry and I remember the exact moment they held him up for me to see and then brought him over to me before taking him to the level 2 nicu here. After twelve hours of hard labor and no successful interventions, he was born a little after 5pm weighing 5lb15oz and 19.5 inches long!!

I don‚Äôt bleed at all in an abnormal way this time so recovery is going easier. We think all is good, he‚Äôs just on CPAP getting a little help breathing. I start asking to pump for him...and his doctor walks in and I knew from the look on his face things had changed. It was just that look they have when they have to tell you news they really wish they didn‚Äôt. Baby was really struggling to breathe on CPAP and just working way too hard, so the level 3 nicu 1.5 hours away was making him a room and sending a life flight team for him. I couldn‚Äôt leave this hospital so soon after delivery. We were going to have to say goodbye. They wheeled me to him to spend as much time as possible with him before he had to go. Walking into the nicu knowing I couldn‚Äôt hold him yet and seeing him fight so hard for air...I fell apart massively. I felt like I had failed by not keeping him inside and this is all my fault. It was the second worst moment of my life. We got to spend 45 minutes before the life flight team arrived to get him ready and leaving that room was torture. They were intubating him and didn‚Äôt want me to see that.

We waited back in my room for a good hour and a half and I kept thinking ‚Äúthis is good because they‚Äôd already be out of here if he was really really bad‚Äù to reassure myself. Then they brought him in to say goodbye. And that‚Äôs the actual worst moment of my life. I am absolutely shattered over the separation and how hard he‚Äôs working just to breathe. Just completely heartbroken in a whole new way. He was on the ventilator and looked more comfortable, but oh god the machines and tubes all over his tiny body üò≠ I can‚Äôt even handle that mental image.

I managed to pump 8ml for him finally while we waited for the team and my husband (who I sent with him) to call me and give me an update. My dad shows up. The hospital made another exception and got the director to override the no transfer of visitors rule so I didn‚Äôt have to be here all alone. I am so thankful I have my daddy here right now. I know I could do this alone but it‚Äôs brutal enough as it is. The vent seemed to help him immensely by about 1:20 am when we finally got the update. My doctor tells me she thinks I should take some ambien so that I can get some sleep after the trauma of the day and I agree because I can feel how tired I am but also can‚Äôt get my brain to shut up about how awful everything felt. I fell asleep and my nurse who I adore and my friend who happens to be a nurse on this floor tonight too both come in to give me meds and hugs and assure me it‚Äôs okay to go to sleep and Jude needs me to rest enough to safely get out of here to go see him soon. I finally pass out I think around 2 after another good cry. 

It‚Äôs now 5:30am and I woke up around 4:45 just in time for pain control which is good because I‚Äôm extremely sore at this point. I think adrenaline and fear blocked a lot of the pain last night. I‚Äôm hoping that by some miracle I get discharged today so that I can go see him and be with him at his hospital but I know I can‚Äôt rush my own healing too dangerously because then we have another big fat emergency to manage.

He‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous but I‚Äôm not ready to share pictures of him yet. He actually looks like a full term baby instead of a premie somehow but it just feels too sacred to share what we have now. My parents told family and told everyone to leave me alone for a while, and I told a few friends who are now the friend filters to keep me from getting bombarded. I just want to hold my baby and I don‚Äôt give a damn about anyone else right now other than my new little family of four. Not actually...but I just don‚Äôt have the capacity to talk to anyone. 

We are so lucky and so many early babies struggle more than he is and I know that. I‚Äôm trying to focus on the good. But damn is it hard in the moment to see past your own moment of trauma. I‚Äôm trying. And I‚Äôm trying to let go of the guilt. I kept him in three weeks longer than his first attempt and those three weeks were huge. I‚Äôm trying to focus on how I succeeded there and not how I failed to go farther. 

April fools day is my least favorite day of the year and somehow I ended up having an April fools day baby. I hoped I would wake up today and it would have been a terrible prank someone pulled on me somehow and I would still be pregnant and he would still be safe inside of me but that didn‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs very real.

I love my little boys. I cannot wait to be with my newest again. Being separated like this feels so unnatural. Someday I‚Äôll be okay again but right now I‚Äôm not and I just needed to write it out where I could without needing to talk to a bunch of IRL people and answer all of their questions. If you‚Äôre the praying type, my family would love every prayer you can offer for him. I‚Äôm not ready for dm‚Äôs or talking to people about this yet but I‚Äôm sure soon I‚Äôll need some kind of support so prior nicu parents feel free to comment if you‚Äôre up for talking when I‚Äôm ready.

Thank you all. Hoping to go pump more and maybe get a little more sleep.",255,20,2020-04-02,preterm birth
BabyBumps,After preterm labor when did you actually give birth?,"How long did your baby stay in after trying to come out?

I went into labor last week at 34+2 and have been on nifedipine since then to stop contractions and labor. It has been working for the most part. Now I‚Äôm 35+4 and I would like to hear from people with similar experiences. 

Thank you!",5,6,2020-03-06,preterm birth
BabyBumps,Quick reflection on giving birth at 34+5: Baby in NICU,"This isn't a full birth story because I have slept about 4 hours in 36 hours, but I just needed somewhere to word dump and process some of what has happened in the past few days. Quick backstory, I had been having early labor symptoms for a few weeks, pulled off work for being dilated 2.5 cm at 33 weeks. Well at 34 weeks and 4 days, body went into labor and despite all interventions could not stop that labor. I had my baby boy yesterday at 4:17 pm. He is currently in the NICU because his lungs are not fully developed at his gestational age. Luckily, he was still 6 lbs 2 oz and has a decent layer of fat on him. He's only on 6 L hi flow nasal cannula, but oxygen looks great. I'm hoping for a speedy discharge, but nicu can be one step forward 2 steps back.

This is my second baby and my first had an easy delivery, easy recovery, and my baby and I bonded instantly. This round was hard, they let me hold him for about 30 seconds after pushing him out (thank goodness he was breathing okay and not in distress).  Then they had to whisk him away to nicu to get him settled with oxygen, a feeding tube, some IVs etc. Well I started to have a bit if a breakdown once I got to my room. A tiny tiny old room in the hospital. I don't get to be in a larger nicer room because I don't have a bassinet and I don't have my baby with me because he is in the nicu. I finally got to visit and hold him at 10:30 pm. After that I could finally get a little bit of sleep until the postpartum cramps settled in. Those things are no joke, especially for round 2. I hate pain meds but took a percocet because it was so bad. Walking around helps too. FTMs, just be aware of those cramps, they hurt.

I feel lost with having my baby in the nicu. Luckily, he is late preterm and those babies do well usually and only have a 1-3 week stay, but things can always go wrong. I also miss my first born and my dogs. I want to go home because my main job now is to just pump. Then I feel like a bad mom because I should want to stay here, near my new little guy. What I hope is that tomorrow morning will bring some clarity and peace to the situation. I know this will just be a blip in his whole life and will not effect our bonding,  but it sure does feel like it now at 4 am after not sleeping for days. 

I am grateful for the OB that was on call during my entire labor process. I delivered 40 minutes before she was off call and she had just come on call when I was in triage. She discussed how normal it is for moms to have increased depression and anxiety with having a baby in nicu and not getting to go home with them. I'm also grateful for the nurses that took care of me and the ones taking care of my baby right now. 

Sorry for the rambling post. I just needed to word dump somewhere to help process.",58,22,2020-02-08,preterm birth
BabyBumps,MFM made some really messed up comments and I am still raging,"I have insulin dependent GD and have had twice weekly BPPs, once with my OB and once with my MFM, since 32 weeks. I‚Äôm 34+6 today. I‚Äôve also had a hellishly difficult pregnancy. You can check my history for more details but long story short: horrible HG since the start, GD diagnosed at 20 weeks that has been difficult to control, irritable uterus, polyhydramnios, pinched nerves leading to constant back and arm pain and numbness, 2 cholestasis scares, etc. At this point at almost 35 weeks, I am in so much pain all the time that I can‚Äôt even stand to make my 2 year old son a snack without almost crying, but I also can‚Äôt sit comfortably. I‚Äôm on 138 units of long acting insulin spread across 3 shots a day, a Zofran pump, correction insulin for highs. 

My baby has been measuring large, especially her abdomen. I have 32cm of fluid. I‚Äôve been crying all the time, because this shitshow pregnancy is making me depressed. My psychiatrist agrees it‚Äôs the pregnancy and the only real remedy is to deliver. ACOG guidelines for poorly controlled GD are delivery late preterm to early term - so 34-38 weeks. I‚Äôm currently scheduled for 38 weeks but decided to broach the topic of moving delivery to 37 weeks with MFM today. 

She declined to move it forward. Which, fine, okay, I was disappointed obviously and I started crying. But then the fucked up comments came. First she said she wouldn‚Äôt do it because even though 99% of 37 weekers are fine, if my baby isn‚Äôt I will sue her. She also constantly referred to me wanting to be delivered now which isn‚Äôt what I was asking for and told me I‚Äôd have a baby with a lot of issues. 

The two most enraging comments though were these: 
‚ÄúYou already have one autistic child (my 2 year old son is autistic), do you want another one?‚Äù (Wtf early term birth doesn‚Äôt cause autism and my son is amazing fuck you) 
‚Äú‚ÄòMaybe baby will have another bad BPP and we will have to deliver before then.‚Äù (So basically ‚Äúhey maybe baby will go into distress and we will have to deliver her to prevent her from dying!‚Äù)

I‚Äôve told my bumper group (I‚Äôm still in the one from my son) and they all think I need to file a complaint. Every time I think about the conversation I start crying from rage. I have to see an MFM for the remainder of the pregnancy but I don‚Äôt want to see her again. I emailed my OB to ask about being moved to a different provider for the remainder.",55,20,2020-02-14,preterm birth
BabyBumps,Multiple soft markers + a short cervix ... SAD is the word,"Update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/ffia85/update\_to\_my\_anatomy\_scan\_filled\_with\_soft/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/ffia85/update_to_my_anatomy_scan_filled_with_soft/) 

X-post from my monthly bumpers sub! Very long post...apologize in advance!

TLDR: Several soft markers found in my 19 week anatomy scan plus a short cervix after low risk NIPT and normal 14 week NT scan. Amniocentesis scheduled for Wednesday morning.

Hi everyone! FTM here, 33 years old in the US. Everything was going great and I was feeling positive until my anatomy scan yesterday.

So my first trimester was breezy, no morning sickness or nausea, just the unbearable headaches here and there. Still running, still working out, still putting in long hours at my (demanding) office job. I thought I could do everything normally until my due date in July! My 14 week NT scan was normal and I also opted for NIPT which came back low risk and news of a baby girl! All blood work came back normal and I was considered low risk.

The second trimester also started out pretty uneventful. My belly was starting to show and although I didn't like the weight gain (body issues all throughout my life), I was feeling very lucky to be able to be a home to a growing baby girl for a few months. My husband and I couldn't wait to see our daughter during our anatomy scan! I even brought my mom along so she could see her granddaughter.

Our anatomy scan was scheduled for 9am on a Friday. The tech did a vaginal US first to measure the cervix and look at the placenta. Then she moved to my belly where she did all her other measurements. We saw baby girl's feet (she was moving so much!), her stomach, and her little face. We saw one open hand and heard her heartbeat. Her weight was at a normal 12 ounces. The tech stepped outside to get the doctor, which she never has had to before with my other ultrasounds. The doctor came in and right off the bat told us there were a few issues that they found.

First, she said my cervix was short and suspected for insufficiency, which might mean possible miscarriage or preterm birth. I would have to come back in two weeks to see if it has changed, and if not, I may need to take meds or a stitch, which I thought was doable, as long as the baby is fine. I'll take any pain or procedure to ensure that my daughter will be born healthy.

Then, the blow to our happiness ... she said there were a few soft markers for trisomies that they were seeing: (a) CPC, soft marker for trisomy 18, (b) echogenic focus, soft marker for trisomy 13 and 21, and (c) pyelectasis, soft marker for trisomy 21. She also said that since one hand wouldn't open up, that could mean trisomy 18 and also my nuchal fold was measuring a little bigger than it should which we all know could be a soft marker for Downs.

Our smiles all of a sudden turned to worry and doubt. How could everything come all at once? How was it possible that my NIPT was low risk as well as my 14 week NT scan and every blood test was normal, and now I am at risk for all of these trisomies? The doctor said that if there was only one soft marker, they wouldn't worry so much, but since there were several, it would be best if I went to see a genetic counselor, who luckily had room for us within the next 30 minutes. We rushed upstairs and I broke down in her office. My husband was angry and upset and I was crying hysterically, mostly because it was such a shock and I definitely did not wake up thinking I would have to deal with anything like this that day.

She explained to us that the NIPT and the ultrasounds are only screening tests and the only way to get a definite diagnostic is to do an amniocentesis, if we choose, which we did not hesitate to do. She squeezed us in for this coming Wednesday which would mean we would get preliminary results that Friday. I understood the risk for miscarriage but I also knew that the information the amnio could give us outweighed the risks.

I have been crying and worrying for the past 24 hours and just feeling sad and depressed. I can't even look at anything baby related and answer any questions about my baby without crying. I've been spending my time reading posts on Reddit about women seeing several soft markers in their US and things ending up fine but also a few posts of things going not so fine. I am really just trying to stay positive and not to think about it until my amnio on Wednesday but it's so hard not feel robbed of the pregnancy that I was envisioning. It's just been a dark cloud for my husband and I. We are still unsure of what we would do if we received news that the baby was positive for something...I know I am also on a timeline because IF we choose to terminate, I would only have until week 24...that's the end of this month!

Anyway, I just really needed to vent and type out my emotions. Thanks for reading if you made it all the way down here! :)",29,19,2020-03-01,preterm birth
BabyBumps,Mild Irritable Uterus,"So, I started feeling some period style cramps at 17w, shortly after feeling the baby move at 16w. While those went away by the next day, I got them again last week Sunday (21w), on and off all day. It was annoying, but I brushed it off. It went away during the week, but I started getting some Braxton Hicks during this past week as well, which felt like a distinct tightening of my uterus, which I could feel from the outside, as opposed to period cramps, which I usually feel in my back. It would last 10-30 seconds or so before going away. While my app said it was normal for 21 weeks, I called the doctor just in case. 

They said that it was still a little earlier than they usually see Braxton Hicks, and definitely to go in for monitoring if I felt the period cramps again.  

Today, on my way to work (I'm 22w today), I started feeling mild period cramps. I only had about two hours of work today, so I decided to stick it out. It got stronger though, so after an hour and a half, I left and called the doctor's answering service. They told me to go into the hospital for monitoring, so I picked up husband and off we went. 

Overall, it was nice to see the hospital in person, since we hadn't done a tour yet. It was really easy to get checked in, and because it was a slow day, I got to go into an L&D room instead of the monitoring rooms. I was really impressed with the birthing suites--they were spacious and had a pull-out sofa bed for guests. Husband set up camp there with a video game while they monitored me. 

They checked my cervical length and dilation, which was thankfully all fine. Not dilated, high and closed. 3.6-4cm for my cervix, and they say not to worry unless it gets less than 1. 

On ultrasound, baby flipped around from head down to breech during the course of the visit. They weren't worried about that though, and said baby might continue to flop around until close to full term. 

The contraction monitor stayed on for about two hours, during which I had occasional minor cramps and 1 or 2 small Braxton Hicks. However, they showed up as being hardly even little blips on the monitor, barely anything above the background noise. Baby kept trying to attack the monitor (and the doppler...and the ultrasound), which was cute :)

The doctor said that it looked like mildly irritable uterus, and to stay hydrated by drinking a gallon a day. She showed me what real contractions look like on the monitor from another chart, and it made me feel a lot better that mine were about 1/20 of the size on the chart. 

As of now, because my cervix is good and I'm not having any spotting or leaking, I was given the clear to resume normal activity, and even go on the long flight I had planned for next week (visiting family in Europe!) So that's great. 

But even though I'm a bit afraid to see the hospital bill, I'm so so so glad we went in to get checked out. I was so worried about preterm labor and losing my rainbow baby, and it was worth the peace of mind to go in for a few hours. Plus, it made me extra confident in our choice of hospital, with how wonderful and friendly the doctors and staff were.",16,9,2020-02-16,preterm birth
BabyBumps,"FTM Birth Story: 5 day labor, 6wk Premature, Placenta Accreta (TW: Blood/loss)","Sorry, this is going to be super long because it is a very rare complication and I want to help others know my experience in case they are experiencing the same things, maybe could save someone's life. Scroll down to the ==== for the actual birth part, and \~\~\~\~ for the baby NICU part.

I got pregnant mid August 2019, 3 months of trying. I knew exactly when I conceived because it was smack dab in the middle of my cycle and I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the middle of the night that only lasted about 5 minutes, and just ""knew"". I have a good hold on my body, I guess (important later). 4 days later I had a positive pregnancy test, a week before my period was supposed to start (spoiler, it didn't)

I made an appointment with OB for my 8 week scan, and I found out that I actually had a natural twin that had died sometime around 6 weeks with no heartbeat (this is the loss btw), and one with a heartbeat. He measured exactly 8 weeks. Week 10, the non viable fetus's sac ruptured with a single bleed with waters. I had a NIPT test that confirmed it was a boy with no chromosomal abnormalities! Other than that, I had the perfect pregnancy. No morning sickness, just a few episodes of low blood sugar, sore boobs, and fatigue. Because of the twin, I had a placenta previa that ended up resolving its self by my 19 week anatomy scan.

The problems started week 30.  I started having pains a few inches below my belly button, kinda right on top of my pelvis and lower back muscle pain. Because of this pain, I couldn't use the tummy/back brace thing I bought. I started not being able to ride in the car for longer than 15 minutes without getting strong braxton hicks, back pain that radiated to the front, that lower belly pain, and what felt like cervical pain. Week 31 picked up my husband from the airport and cried all the way home in pain, but didn't want to go to the ER because of COVID. It went away as soon as I got home. I was timing the pain and it was about 4 minutes apart. I chalked it up to false labor because of the hour long car ride. I brought it up to my OB at my 32 week and he assured me some pain is normal at this stage, especially since the car could agitate false labor. He stressed if a warm bath, lots of water, and laying on my side doesn't make it stop to come in to L&D. He gave me a cervical exam, I was 50% effaced and not dilated.

The pelvic and back pain continued into week 32 and 33, with many braxton hicks and period like cramps. I had a regular OB appointment Wednesday 3/18, and because baby was measuring big, I was set to go to a specialist OB Thursday 3/19. At my OB appointment Wednesday, I stressed I was in a lot of pain. I broke down and cried because a wave of pain (like a contraction) hit me in the middle of explaining the pain to him. He gave me a cervical check and I was 50% effaced and 2cm dilated. He sent me home with a prescription for Nifedipine. I took it that night and got some sleep, at least.

Next day 3/19 I went to my specialist OB appointment for baby measuring 2 weeks ahead and possible preeclampsia. I told him about my pain during my scan and he said baby's head was wedged up far into pelvis so much he was having a hard time getting a good look at the head. He said sometimes pain happens when baby's head is up in there, and to watch some Netflix or something and relax. Woo. I went home and worked (WFH), until I could no longer stand to sit. Around 4pm, I started actually leaning on my couch upside down to move baby off my pelvis, the pain was so unbearable I was going crazy thinking of SOMETHING that might relieve the pain! At this point it felt like someone was stabbing me in my lower stomach with terrible back pain that radiated to the front and down my legs. I ended up in my bed crying and writhing in pain before I realized the pain was most intense exactly 5 minutes apart. ""Is this contractions?"" I thought. No, I didn't want to be a worry wart, and I could still talk through them, and they didn't start at the top of my uterus. I did what my doctor said and I went to take a warm bath. Contractions still happened in there. Got out of the bath, drank huge amount of water quickly, still contracting. Hastily made a boiled egg sandwich, pissed off, still contracting. Around 7pm, told the husband we needed to go to the hospital right when it started pouring rain. We made it to the hospital alive. Due to COVID, the entrance people wanted me to go to the ER, but I told them (begged them) through contractions to let me go straight to L&D. They called up and L&D accepted me.

I got into a deliver theater and hooked up to the fetal monitor. They couldn't really find my contractions but obviously saw I was in pain every 3 minutes. Doctor came in and did a cervical check, 75% effaced, stretchy 2cm dilated. The hospital I was going to deliver at does not do NICU babies. They told me I could deliver here and baby could be helicopter flighted to the nearest NICU hospital (Dallas), or I could be ambulance transported there while still pregnant. They strongly suggested I be transferred there as I'd receive better care. I REALLY liked this hospital, it was practically brand new, only about 5 years old so everything was fancy and updated. I was upset, but I wanted what was best for my baby, so I chose the ambulance. They started me on magnesium, stuck a catheter in me (not pleasant without the epidural), and gave me my first steroid shot (also unpleasant). I think around an hour passed, still contracting, magnesium in full force (hot, sweaty, disoriented) they did another cervical check and I was 75% effaced, stretchy 3cm dilated. Stuff was happening for real. The ambulance transport was called and I was transported to Dallas (about an hour drive).

I was now in a delivery theater in Dallas where I saw many different people, honestly it was a blur at this point as it was already 3AM and I kinda just wanted to go home (haha...). I was still on the magnesium, and they started me on a round of antibiotic because I didn't get my Strep B test yet. While I was being transported, husband went home to collect some stuff like entertainment, clothes, etc. and arrived around 5AM. Another cervical check was performed and I was still 75% effaced and 3cm dilated. On the magnesium, the pain was still there but fading in and out, it was a nice change. I was able to catch some sleep early in the morning 3/20. They sent me up to antepartum because the magnesium worked for now at delaying dilation.  I was now on Nifedipine, Norco, IV fluids waiting in a regular small cramped hospital room with nothing but my Nintendo Switch and the new Animal Crossing game to keep me and hubby company. Seriously, that game was a life saver.

Despite the drugs, IV fluids and drinking plenty of water (now catheter free thank god), I was still having contractions every 10 minutes apart. They kept hooking me up to the fetal stress monitor on and off thru the day of 3/20 and decided to send me back to a labor room at the wee hours of 3/21. They gave me another round of Nifedipine and Norco that stopped my labor in it's tracks and I got my 2nd round of steroids for baby. The drugs unfortunately only lasted 12 hours. As soon as they sent me back to Antepartum, contractions were back. This series of events happened twice, and a lot of it is a blur, but I was went down to L&D and back up to Antepartum twice.

3/23 I was in pain the majority of the day. I could barely sit up in the bed to eat my hospital meals, and just the pressure of everything made any position almost impossible. I was hooked up to the fetal monitor most of the day but they could never really see my contractions on that thing, so they gave me a button to push every time I ""felt"" a contraction. I started to feel like some of the nurses didn't believe me, that I wasn't having ""real"" contractions. I started asking when I could go home and if I could just deal with it at home until my due date (lol yeah, I was getting a little crazy at this point). That evening my husband went home for a bit to take care of the animals, I was on the toilet trying really hard to pee or something (the pressure was real). The doctor came in on me and asked how I was doing, I just said ""well I feel like I have to push but nothings coming out, so there's that."" he just said ""well, Nifedipine isn't going to stop real labor, and I think you're in real labor, It's been more than 48 hours since your steroids so I think we are going to send you to L&D and take you off the drugs and see what happens."" He also did a cervical check on me and I was 100% effaced and 4cm dilated, -2 station and bag was felt. Stuff was still happening despite their best efforts to stop it. This was day 5 of this. I was tired, I was SO done. My husband comes back right as they were gathering the team to wheel me back downstairs. At this point I was 34+2 weeks.

====================

It was very busy the night of 3/23. The L&D was so busy I was placed in a temporary emergency room like room with just curtains separating several people. I was there for an hour, got another cervical check 100% effaced, stretchy 4cm dilated, -2 station and bag was felt  (no change) and waited. Finally got a room, hooked up to the fetal monitor and left to my own devices. Hours passed by without much checks. I figured they were busy and the people watching the fetal monitors didn't see my contractions, so no big deal I was. I figure I was just going to get sent back up to Antepartum anyway and my special hell would continue for a month possibly. At this point I'd given up hope. My only hope was that I could feel my contractions, and I knew they had to be doing SOMETHING. My husband found it somewhat amusing he could hear the other women scream in pain and agony from our room. I had another urge to use the restroom, my husband helped me and I felt that urge to push again. This time, a trickle was heard even after I had urinated and I told my husband ""I'm not peeing, that's my water."". My water FINALLY broke, things were visibly HAPPENING! I was happy, husband was panicking. I got back into bed and weirdest sensations of water gushing followed. Nurse came in and confirmed it was my waters and told me I was having the baby today. It was now 3/24 around 2am. Not long after, the anesthesia man came in and did the epidural. I was scared of it but honestly it wasn't as bad as people played it out to be. Started on Picotin as well to speed up labor since LO would be a preemie and delaying after water breaking increased some risks.

Left alone for a while again, someone finally checked up on me about 3 hours later. I suppose they were watching my contractions on the monitor which were CLEARLY visible now, thanks to the Picotin, so I wasn't ignored or anything even though it felt that way lol. My body at this point felt like some sort of plant, couldn't move, couldn't feel my lower half, no more pain, life was good. 10/10 recommend epidural. Especially for what comes next.

At around 5:30 am, cervical check again, they didn't get very far. ""Oops, there's baby's head!"" 100% effaced, 10cm dilated, 2 station. He was ready to come out! They hastily set up the theater with a table full of supplies, geared up, put my legs in stirrups and told me how to push. When the doctor was ready, we pushed. 3 sets of 10 second pushing was all it took and he was out at 6:01am! Probably all of 5 minutes. No tears, but I did not escape without a large hemorrhoid.

The NICU team was ready to receive him, as they were assessing him the doctor was massaging my stomach to detach the placenta. He scored a 9.9 on APGAR. Nurses were mumbling to themselves about how it was impossible that this is a 34 week baby. He came out 6lbs 6oz, 19"". One of them asked me if I was SURE about his gestational age, and another corrected her saying ""Yeah, she had a 8 week dating scan."". Guess I just make GIGANTIC babies? He was handed to me wrapped up in a bundle of joy, my husband taking many pictures. Doctor was still massaging my stomach and apparently had her whole arm in my vagina. This is where the sh\*t hit the fan.

Baby was hastily taken away from me, even though the NICU team gave the clear for skin to skin time. At this point I sorta looked down (huuuge mistake) and you know how farmers check on pregnant cows by sticking their entire arm in the cows butt? Yeah. That. Exactly that. Plus much blood. My husband became visibly concerned. Shortly that, I started shaking uncontrollably, feeling very cold. The doctor said the placenta was coming out in pieces, and what felt like some calcification. They were somewhat yelling to themselves about how much blood I had lost, no one knew, they had only speculated because someone had apparently made a mistake with the bucket (placed gauze or something in it, not sure). I remember them unplugging me from everything and starting to wheel me out of the room. I was saying to one of the nurses ""I'm cold, can I have more blankets please?"" they told my husband to stay in the room. I had NO IDEA what was happening, and obviously my brain wasn't comprehending I was dieing of blood loss, but my body knew because I was going into hypovolemic shock. I briefly heard them saying something to my husband that if whatever they were about to do didn't work, they'd have to take my uterus. I was ok with it at the time, I guess (shock does weird stuff to you lol).

I was now in the OR fading in and out, shaking so bad my arms were coming up off the bed. Funnily enough, my lower half was still completely immune to this shaking. They have transferred me to the OR table and started to perform a curettage (D&C?) to remove the placenta parts. I could hear the vacuum and felt the scraping sensation and it was all really bazaar. I thought it was interesting they tilted the table so that my head was closer to the ground, I guess so my brain got more blood or something? The nurses were now getting mad at the lab because they were trying to get my blood count and they ran the wrong test the first time, oops. A lot of stuff going wrong here, I thought. Luckily they got it going.

I probably needed a transfusion. They start to get another IV line in me just in case but couldn't get a vein. I have HARD veins to begin with and they were non existent with my blood loss. Took them a while to finally get one in my foot. I was in recovery at this point with a balloon in my uterus to control the bleeding.  It's basically a catheter but for your uterus that inflates and puts pressure on the uterine walls, collects blood that is expelled to be measured. After waking up a little, still a bit cold, nurse informs me if bleeding doesn't stop they will take my uterus. They said I had placenta accreta, it was very rare, and that even \*IF\* I keep my uterus, they strongly recommend no more pregnancies, and if I do get pregnant, I'd be high risk and my uterus would be removed at delivery then. At this point the shock daydream wore off and I was kinda bummed about it. I was sent back to a delivery room for close observation the rest of the day.

I was sorta loopy the whole day, didn't really try to move much, slept a lot. My oxygen was dipping according to the beepy machine. Sometime during the middle of the day I ended up needing a unit of blood, felt slighly better afterward. They sent me back to Antepartum (now postpartum I guess). I got news my baby was doing really well and was just a little bit jaundice with low blood sugar, but didn't require any breathing treatments. He just needed to eat. I felt like such a shit person because it was almost 16 hours after birth and I still haven't seen him at all. Husband was at my side the whole time. Finally got a nurse to show husband where baby was and he got to hold him for an hour or so. When he got back I attempted to take a shower (hadn't showered since that bath before I went to the hospital... I was.. uh.. ripe) and almost feinted. I couldn't see the baby if I couldn't sit up right for more than a few minutes. I was so mad at myself. Not to mention I wanted to breast feed, and do all sorts of other magical stuff with my newborn like skin to skin, close contact, etc, as per handbooks. The good news is I wasn't bleeding, it appears my uterus lives to see another day (and I do to, I guess).

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

3/25 in the morning, I managed to feel somewhat well enough to wheel myself to the NICU and see baby. They wouldn't let my husband in at the same time because of COVID. I was lucky he was even able to stay at the hospital with me at all. I felt so disconnected with him I couldn't believe he was my baby. I cried and told him I was sorry while I held him. I only held him for 30 minutes before the nurse noticed I was swelling and recommended I go back to my room, so I did. Baby was doing great and taking about .5 oz thru bottle and the rest thru tube feeding. I had more labs and my blood count was still too low for them to release me. I was given another transfusion. After the transfusion, I felt much better! They discharged me in the evening. I was able to stay in my room as a non-patient (known as ""rooming in"") so that I could visit baby. I started pumping and giving baby some colostrum. Husband was kicked out at this point because of COVID. Baby was being fed formula, which was fine.

3/26 Doctors said if he ate 2oz he could come home. He was at around 1.5oz at this point, I was super excited. I stayed another night in the hospital room pumping and playing Animal Crossing.

3/27 Doctors said if he ate 2.5oz he could come home. He was eating barely over 1.5oz. I felt like I was being strung along at this point,  but they were still tube feeding him and giving him some UV treatments so it was for the best.

3/28 I went home, I couldn't be in the hospital any longer. I was going nuts being all alone, though I did enjoy the company of the NICU nurses who taught me tips and tricks on how to feed and change him. I was feeding him every feed except the 2am feed, because I needed sleep lol.

I visited for a few hours on 3/29, 3/30 and I was informed that if he ate really well the night of 3/30, I could room-in on 3/31 and take him home on 4/1. I brought my bags 3/31 and was so excited. My husband was excited even though he couldn't come to the hospital with me or bring him home with me. When I got to the NICU, a pediatrician and 2 nurses were hovering over his bed talking to themselves. The doctor noticed I had came in and said ""Sorry, you can't stay with him tonight."" He was having a random episode of pauses of breathing (apnea). I was devastated. I held back my tears while the nurses were talking to me but after holding him for an hour or so I went to my car and just cried and cried.

4/1 I was told I could try rooming in again that Friday, 4/3 if he had NO MORE episodes. He did not! I got to room in 4/3 and 4/4 I was promptly rushed out the door alone with my newborn no later than 11am lol, which worked for me because I did NOT want anything to do with the hospital at that point. The hospital gave me a lot of freebies which I'm still using like little breast milk cups and stuff. Bonus!

I'm now 4 weeks postpartum, my hemorrhoid has healed, baby has been home 3 weeks, and life is wonderful. He is such a good baby! But I mostly credit that to the NICU nurses who took care of him during his most critical period. I still get a little dizzy from time to time but my bleeding has stopped completely and I am taking iron supplements. I am exclusively bottle feeding and pumping but I am only getting about 1.5oz of breast milk still due to blood loss and lack of first contact... But it's something, right?

I saw my OB at 2  weeks postpartum and he was shocked. He said in his 20 years of OB, he'd only seen 4 other cases like mine. Me being the 5th. He said only 1.5% of all pregnancies have this complication, and I had none of the risk factors except MAYBE the twin.  He was sorry the pain I was having was definitely due to the accreta, as there might have been internal bleeding going on as well. He said I could have another child 2-3 years down the line and it would be high risk, but accreta shouldn't happen again. This was a huge difference than what the OR doctor had told me in the hospital. I am not sure who is being more conservative and if I really want another baby after all that anyway....

Anyway, my advice to anyone having pains similar to mine, don't try to ignore it and try to push for answers. Also, if you are planning a home birth or some other type of birth not in a hospital and you have any of this pain, don't do it. It's not worth your life! It's hard, and you might get told to just relax and watch Netflix, but get help at the first sign you might need it because if you THINK you do, you do! You are not going to be a burden to anyone.

Trust your gut, I had a feeling baby was coming early, I had his room done at 28 weeks and I went on an Amazon shopping spree to get every last item i needed for him at 30 weeks. Coincidence? I don't know.  I just had one of those feelings. Thanks for reading!",119,38,2020-04-25,premature birth
BabyBumps,My precipitous premature birth story,"My little lady was born 4/11 at 2:50am at 34+5 weeks. As a background other than a few weeks of somewhat mild morning sickness the first few weeks, my pregnancy was a breeze. Until the last week.  So starting Monday of the last week i started to have off & on back pains. It was sporadic & didn't hurt at all in the front, so of course I tried to justify it as anything other than labor. I thought maybe it was spasms, maybe I was constipated, some days it hurt, other days i was totally fine. Then Friday rolled around. So for a few hours Friday morning I was having timeable conractions. They were about 10 mins apart, irregular, not super painful, & I was working so I was still able to talk through them. Since I work from home I was able to take a hot shower & they all but stopped in the afternoon. By Friday night I felt better than I had all week. I had no pain at all. By midnight I was laying in bed & sometime around 12:15 the contractions started again. They were instantly about a min long & 5 mins apart. Around 12:35 my water broke. At this point i was going back & forth from my bed to the toilet. I already had a pad on, so when my water broke i thought well either my water broke or I lost all control of my bladder, since the pad was soaked through. And that's exactly what I went to tell my husband. Lol. So after that my contractions got way worse. I was a moaning screaming mess. At 12:55 I called the doctor's office. My husband convinced me to start packing a bag. (Looking back I was definitely in denial of how far along I was.)  My husband told me later that I got so bad that he wasn't sure whether to pull up the car, or put down a towel in the bathroom. So, we get a call from the dr & head in. At this point I can barely sit & I'm screaming like a crazy person. I know during 1 contaction I screamed ""Omg I'm not going to make it!"" So, I get checked into triage at 1:35. Since my husband couldn't come up yet I could barely get changed & the nurse had to help with some of it. The dr comes in & checks me & told me I'm fully dialated. To which I thought there's no f-ing way. So as I'm being rolled to the delivery room i call my husband to get up here & i ask the nurse for an epidural or something, to which she said, ""oh sweetie, there's no time for that.""  So i get to the room & they tell me to push. I never felt the urge to push, which is probably good b/c idk where she would have been born if I had. So initially pushing felt good compared to screaming during contractions. But then the ring of fire hit & it took me a long time to make more progress. I finally pushed her out at 2:50. I didn't have any tearing & just 1 hemroid. She was 4 lbs 3 ozs. There was a whole NICU team that was waiting for her. They examed her & I was able to hold her for about 30 secs before they took her to the NICU. My recovery was great, my throat hurt worse than anything for the 1st day.  

My little nugget is still in the NICU, but she's doing well.  I wanted to add that you really don't need to bring anything to the hospital other than a phone charger & maybe a pair of sweatpants. I didn't bring any toiletries, but they gave me all that stuff.i wore my gown & my PJ pants I wore to the hospital the whole time.",69,6,2020-04-24,premature birth

BabyBumps,"Birth story: Zachary, born 36 w 5 d. Epidural, vacuum-assisted, overall positive. 19 hours of labor, almost 5 hours pushing.","I really appreciated reading all the stories that other people were willing to share so I figured it's my turn to ""pay it forward."" Happy to answer any questions for anyone.

Around 6 pm on Thursday 2/27 (36w4d) I was sitting on the couch putting on my shoes to do an exercise video on youtube.¬† I‚Äôd been pretty active prepregnancy and tried to continue that during pregnancy but I definitely slowed down toward the end.¬† After I put on one shoe I felt a gush of fluid and told my husband that I thought I might‚Äôve peed! I went to put a pad on (with one shoe on!) and sure enough, fluid kept coming out.¬† It was very slightly tinged with blood. We called the L&D advice line and they said if I thought my water broke I should come in to get checked out. We wrapped up some stuff around the house and got to the hospital around 7pm.¬† I sat on a towel in the car and by the time we got to the hospital the towel was pretty soaked. The on-call obstetrician checked me and confirmed that my water had broken and said I was 3cm dilated and baby was at -3 station.

They moved me to a delivery room and the waiting began.¬† Contractions began to really ramp up and around 11:30pm I asked for an epidural.¬† I was 4cm dilated at that time. After the epidural, I was able to sleep for about 2.5 hours in total.¬† Around 4 am I woke up and I couldn‚Äôt hear baby‚Äôs heartbeat on the monitor but it turned out he‚Äôd moved down so the monitor just needed to be repositioned -- all was fine.¬†

The nurse checked me and said I was fully dilated and it was almost time to push.¬† I didn‚Äôt start pushing until 8:10 am. I wasn‚Äôt sure if having a mirror to see my pushing would freak me out but I actually found it really interesting and it gave me something to focus on.¬† I pushed and pushed, on my back and on each side, and felt like I was making no progress but the nurse assured me that he was indeed moving down the birth canal. A few hours in, they said baby‚Äôs heartrate was dropping during contractions so I had to wear an oxygen mask between contractions.¬† I had a button I could use to give myself an extra ‚Äúpush‚Äù of epidural. WIthout the extra ‚Äúpush‚Äù I could accurately tell the nurses when a contraction was coming before the monitor detected it. With the extra ‚Äúpush‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt feel it at all and had to rely on them to tell me based on the monitor.¬†¬†

After about 3.5 hours of pushing I was exhausted and basically had a meltdown.¬† At that point there were a couple of nurses and a midwife in the room and without question they seamlessly cleaned up and left the room to give me a break.¬† When they came back 20 minutes later I was ready to keep pushing. The obstetrician suggested I get some pitocin to help intensify the contractions and I agreed.¬† She also asked if we‚Äôd consider a vacuum-assisted delivery and we agreed. The problem was that baby‚Äôs head was sideways and not fitting past my pubic bone. The vacuum lost suction and popped off one time, but finally at 1:24 pm, after almost five hours of pushing, he was born!¬† Despite being over three weeks early, he weighed a hefty 7 lb 11 oz. We‚Äôd actually just had a routine checkup four days before he was born and based on that ultrasound he was only a bit over 6 lbs. I can‚Äôt imagine if he‚Äôd waited until full term to make his appearance!¬†¬†¬†

Because he was premature they wanted NICU staff in the room when he was born so there were probably 8-10 medical staff in the room when he was actually born.¬† They put him on my stomach and vigorously rubbed him to make him cry, then quickly took him to a warming bed to check him more thoroughly. After only a few minutes the NICU staff left which was a really good sign -- he was healthy! I had no external tears, only small internal tears that needed three stitches in total.¬†After a few hours we moved to a recovery room.¬† We stayed for two nights after his birth because he was premature, but he was healthy enough that he stayed in the room with us the entire time.¬†

The recovery has not been as bad as I thought it would be. Maybe I hyped the whole thing up in my head. As of now, a week postpartum, my pain is greatly reduced and I can walk and get up and down from sitting and laying positions easily.¬† Breastfeeding has gotten easier as we have both learned how to work together. I‚Äôm only about 10 lbs above my prepregnancy weight now. As of my last pregnancy weigh-in, I‚Äôd gained about 36 pounds (but that was when I was admitted when my water broke, weighed with clothes, sweater, and shoes, so I suspect it might‚Äôve been less).¬† I‚Äôve had no negative effects from the epidural. My husband has been super supportive -- I feel really pampered at home. In retrospect I actually wonder if I should‚Äôve seen warning signs that he was coming early. For the week before his arrival I started feeling a huge increase in pelvic pressure and discomfort when walking. The day my water broke I was going to run an errand on the way home from work but I had this overwhelming feeling of needing to get home, so I skipped the errand.¬† Who knows!¬†¬†

My husband also consulted evil Dr. Google and started telling me he‚Äôs worried because of the associated risks of premature birth, placenta previa etc.

Scroll down to the ==== for the actual birth part, and \~\~\~\~ for the baby NICU part.

I got pregnant mid August 2019, 3 months of trying. I knew exactly when I conceived because it was smack dab in the middle of my cycle and I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the middle of the night that only lasted about 5 minutes, and just ""knew"". I have a good hold on my body, I guess (important later). 4 days later I had a positive pregnancy test, a week before my period was supposed to start (spoiler, it didn't)

I made an appointment with OB for my 8 week scan, and I found out that I actually had a natural twin that had died sometime around 6 weeks with no heartbeat (this is the loss btw), and one with a heartbeat. He measured exactly 8 weeks. Week 10, the non viable fetus's sac ruptured with a single bleed with waters. I had a NIPT test that confirmed it was a boy with no chromosomal abnormalities! Other than that, I had the perfect pregnancy. No morning sickness, just a few episodes of low blood sugar, sore boobs, and fatigue. Because of the twin, I had a placenta previa that ended up resolving its self by my 19 week anatomy scan.

The problems started week 30.  I started having pains a few inches below my belly button, kinda right on top of my pelvis and lower back muscle pain. Because of this pain, I couldn't use the tummy/back brace thing I bought. I started not being able to ride in the car for longer than 15 minutes without getting strong braxton hicks, back pain that radiated to the front, that lower belly pain, and what felt like cervical pain. Week 31 picked up my husband from the airport and cried all the way home in pain, but didn't want to go to the ER because of COVID. It went away as soon as I got home. I was timing the pain and it was about 4 minutes apart. I chalked it up to false labor because of the hour long car ride. I brought it up to my OB at my 32 week and he assured me some pain is normal at this stage, especially since the car could agitate false labor. He stressed if a warm bath, lots of water, and laying on my side doesn't make it stop to come in to L&D. He gave me a cervical exam, I was 50% effaced and not dilated.

The pelvic and back pain continued into week 32 and 33, with many braxton hicks and period like cramps. I had a regular OB appointment Wednesday 3/18, and because baby was measuring big, I was set to go to a specialist OB Thursday 3/19. At my OB appointment Wednesday, I stressed I was in a lot of pain. I broke down and cried because a wave of pain (like a contraction) hit me in the middle of explaining the pain to him. He gave me a cervical check and I was 50% effaced and 2cm dilated. He sent me home with a prescription for Nifedipine. I took it that night and got some sleep, at least.

Next day 3/19 I went to my specialist OB appointment for baby measuring 2 weeks ahead and possible preeclampsia. I told him about my pain during my scan and he said baby's head was wedged up far into pelvis so much he was having a hard time getting a good look at the head. He said sometimes pain happens when baby's head is up in there, and to watch some Netflix or something and relax. Woo. I went home and worked (WFH), until I could no longer stand to sit. Around 4pm, I started actually leaning on my couch upside down to move baby off my pelvis, the pain was so unbearable I was going crazy thinking of SOMETHING that might relieve the pain! At this point it felt like someone was stabbing me in my lower stomach with terrible back pain that radiated to the front and down my legs. I ended up in my bed crying and writhing in pain before I realized the pain was most intense exactly 5 minutes apart. ""Is this contractions?"" I thought. No, I didn't want to be a worry wart, and I could still talk through them, and they didn't start at the top of my uterus. I did what my doctor said and I went to take a warm bath. Contractions still happened in there. Got out of the bath, drank huge amount of water quickly, still contracting. Hastily made a boiled egg sandwich, pissed off, still contracting. Around 7pm, told the husband we needed to go to the hospital right when it started pouring rain. We made it to the hospital alive. Due to COVID, the entrance people wanted me to go to the ER, but I told them (begged them) through contractions to let me go straight to L&D. They called up and L&D accepted me.

I got into a deliver theater and hooked up to the fetal monitor. They couldn't really find my contractions but obviously saw I was in pain every 3 minutes. Doctor came in and did a cervical check, 75% effaced, stretchy 2cm dilated. The hospital I was going to deliver at does not do NICU babies. They told me I could deliver here and baby could be helicopter flighted to the nearest NICU hospital (Dallas), or I could be ambulance transported there while still pregnant. They strongly suggested I be transferred there as I'd receive better care. I REALLY liked this hospital, it was practically brand new, only about 5 years old so everything was fancy and updated. I was upset, but I wanted what was best for my baby, so I chose the ambulance. They started me on magnesium, stuck a catheter in me (not pleasant without the epidural), and gave me my first steroid shot (also unpleasant). I think around an hour passed, still contracting, magnesium in full force (hot, sweaty, disoriented) they did another cervical check and I was 75% effaced, stretchy 3cm dilated. Stuff was happening for real. The ambulance transport was called and I was transported to Dallas (about an hour drive).

I was now in a delivery theater in Dallas where I saw many different people, honestly it was a blur at this point as it was already 3AM and I kinda just wanted to go home (haha...). I was still on the magnesium, and they started me on a round of antibiotic because I didn't get my Strep B test yet. While I was being transported, husband went home to collect some stuff like entertainment, clothes, etc. and arrived around 5AM. Another cervical check was performed and I was still 75% effaced and 3cm dilated. On the magnesium, the pain was still there but fading in and out, it was a nice change. I was able to catch some sleep early in the morning 3/20. They sent me up to antepartum because the magnesium worked for now at delaying dilation.  I was now on Nifedipine, Norco, IV fluids waiting in a regular small cramped hospital room with nothing but my Nintendo Switch and the new Animal Crossing game to keep me and hubby company. Seriously, that game was a life saver.

Despite the drugs, IV fluids and drinking plenty of water (now catheter free thank god), I was still having contractions every 10 minutes apart. They kept hooking me up to the fetal stress monitor on and off thru the day of 3/20 and decided to send me back to a labor room at the wee hours of 3/21. They gave me another round of Nifedipine and Norco that stopped my labor in it's tracks and I got my 2nd round of steroids for baby. The drugs unfortunately only lasted 12 hours. As soon as they sent me back to Antepartum, contractions were back. This series of events happened twice, and a lot of it is a blur, but I was went down to L&D and back up to Antepartum twice.

3/23 I was in pain the majority of the day. I could barely sit up in the bed to eat my hospital meals, and just the pressure of everything made any position almost impossible. I was hooked up to the fetal monitor most of the day but they could never really see my contractions on that thing, so they gave me a button to push every time I ""felt"" a contraction. I started to feel like some of the nurses didn't believe me, that I wasn't having ""real"" contractions. I started asking when I could go home and if I could just deal with it at home until my due date (lol yeah, I was getting a little crazy at this point). That evening my husband went home for a bit to take care of the animals, I was on the toilet trying really hard to pee or something (the pressure was real). The doctor came in on me and asked how I was doing, I just said ""well I feel like I have to push but nothings coming out, so there's that."" he just said ""well, Nifedipine isn't going to stop real labor, and I think you're in real labor, It's been more than 48 hours since your steroids so I think we are going to send you to L&D and take you off the drugs and see what happens."" He also did a cervical check on me and I was 100% effaced and 4cm dilated, -2 station and bag was felt. Stuff was still happening despite their best efforts to stop it. This was day 5 of this. I was tired, I was SO done. My husband comes back right as they were gathering the team to wheel me back downstairs. At this point I was 34+2 weeks.

====================

It was very busy the night of 3/23. The L&D was so busy I was placed in a temporary emergency room like room with just curtains separating several people. I was there for an hour, got another cervical check 100% effaced, stretchy 4cm dilated, -2 station and bag was felt  (no change) and waited. Finally got a room, hooked up to the fetal monitor and left to my own devices. Hours passed by without much checks. I figured they were busy and the people watching the fetal monitors didn't see my contractions, so no big deal I was. I figure I was just going to get sent back up to Antepartum anyway and my special hell would continue for a month possibly. At this point I'd given up hope. My only hope was that I could feel my contractions, and I knew they had to be doing SOMETHING. My husband found it somewhat amusing he could hear the other women scream in pain and agony from our room. I had another urge to use the restroom, my husband helped me and I felt that urge to push again. This time, a trickle was heard even after I had urinated and I told my husband ""I'm not peeing, that's my water."". My water FINALLY broke, things were visibly HAPPENING! I was happy, husband was panicking. I got back into bed and weirdest sensations of water gushing followed. Nurse came in and confirmed it was my waters and told me I was having the baby today. It was now 3/24 around 2am. Not long after, the anesthesia man came in and did the epidural. I was scared of it but honestly it wasn't as bad as people played it out to be. Started on Picotin as well to speed up labor since LO would be a preemie and delaying after water breaking increased some risks.

Left alone for a while again, someone finally checked up on me about 3 hours later. I suppose they were watching my contractions on the monitor which were CLEARLY visible now, thanks to the Picotin, so I wasn't ignored or anything even though it felt that way lol. My body at this point felt like some sort of plant, couldn't move, couldn't feel my lower half, no more pain, life was good. 10/10 recommend epidural. Especially for what comes next.

At around 5:30 am, cervical check again, they didn't get very far. ""Oops, there's baby's head!"" 100% effaced, 10cm dilated, 2 station. He was ready to come out! They hastily set up the theater with a table full of supplies, geared up, put my legs in stirrups and told me how to push. When the doctor was ready, we pushed. 3 sets of 10 second pushing was all it took and he was out at 6:01am! Probably all of 5 minutes. No tears, but I did not escape without a large hemorrhoid.

The NICU team was ready to receive him, as they were assessing him the doctor was massaging my stomach to detach the placenta. He scored a 9.9 on APGAR. Nurses were mumbling to themselves about how it was impossible that this is a 34 week baby. He came out 6lbs 6oz, 19"". One of them asked me if I was SURE about his gestational age, and another corrected her saying ""Yeah, she had a 8 week dating scan."". Guess I just make GIGANTIC babies? He was handed to me wrapped up in a bundle of joy, my husband taking many pictures. Doctor was still massaging my stomach and apparently had her whole arm in my vagina. This is where the sh\*t hit the fan.

Baby was hastily taken away from me, even though the NICU team gave the clear for skin to skin time. At this point I sorta looked down (huuuge mistake) and you know how farmers check on pregnant cows by sticking their entire arm in the cows butt? Yeah. That. Exactly that. Plus much blood. My husband became visibly concerned. Shortly that, I started shaking uncontrollably, feeling very cold. The doctor said the placenta was coming out in pieces, and what felt like some calcification. They were somewhat yelling to themselves about how much blood I had lost, no one knew, they had only speculated because someone had apparently made a mistake with the bucket (placed gauze or something in it, not sure). I remember them unplugging me from everything and starting to wheel me out of the room. I was saying to one of the nurses ""I'm cold, can I have more blankets please?"" they told my husband to stay in the room. I had NO IDEA what was happening, and obviously my brain wasn't comprehending I was dieing of blood loss, but my body knew because I was going into hypovolemic shock. I briefly heard them saying something to my husband that if whatever they were about to do didn't work, they'd have to take my uterus. I was ok with it at the time, I guess (shock does weird stuff to you lol).

I was now in the OR fading in and out, shaking so bad my arms were coming up off the bed. Funnily enough, my lower half was still completely immune to this shaking. They have transferred me to the OR table and started to perform a curettage (D&C?) to remove the placenta parts. I could hear the vacuum and felt the scraping sensation and it was all really bazaar. I thought it was interesting they tilted the table so that my head was closer to the ground, I guess so my brain got more blood or something? The nurses were now getting mad at the lab because they were trying to get my blood count and they ran the wrong test the first time, oops. A lot of stuff going wrong here, I thought. Luckily they got it going.

I probably needed a transfusion. They start to get another IV line in me just in case but couldn't get a vein. I have HARD veins to begin with and they were non existent with my blood loss. Took them a while to finally get one in my foot. I was in recovery at this point with a balloon in my uterus to control the bleeding.  It's basically a catheter but for your uterus that inflates and puts pressure on the uterine walls, collects blood that is expelled to be measured. After waking up a little, still a bit cold, nurse informs me if bleeding doesn't stop they will take my uterus. They said I had placenta accreta, it was very rare, and that even \*IF\* I keep my uterus, they strongly recommend no more pregnancies, and if I do get pregnant, I'd be high risk and my uterus would be removed at delivery then. At this point the shock daydream wore off and I was kinda bummed about it. I was sent back to a delivery room for close observation the rest of the day.

I was sorta loopy the whole day, didn't really try to move much, slept a lot. My oxygen was dipping according to the beepy machine. Sometime during the middle of the day I ended up needing a unit of blood, felt slighly better afterward. They sent me back to Antepartum (now postpartum I guess). I got news my baby was doing really well and was just a little bit jaundice with low blood sugar, but didn't require any breathing treatments. He just needed to eat. I felt like such a shit person because it was almost 16 hours after birth and I still haven't seen him at all. Husband was at my side the whole time. Finally got a nurse to show husband where baby was and he got to hold him for an hour or so. When he got back I attempted to take a shower (hadn't showered since that bath before I went to the hospital... I was.. uh.. ripe) and almost feinted. I couldn't see the baby if I couldn't sit up right for more than a few minutes. I was so mad at myself. Not to mention I wanted to breast feed, and do all sorts of other magical stuff with my newborn like skin to skin, close contact, etc, as per handbooks. The good news is I wasn't bleeding, it appears my uterus lives to see another day (and I do to, I guess).

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

3/25 in the morning, I managed to feel somewhat well enough to wheel myself to the NICU and see baby. They wouldn't let my husband in at the same time because of COVID. I was lucky he was even able to stay at the hospital with me at all. I felt so disconnected with him I couldn't believe he was my baby. I cried and told him I was sorry while I held him. I only held him for 30 minutes before the nurse noticed I was swelling and recommended I go back to my room, so I did. Baby was doing great and taking about .5 oz thru bottle and the rest thru tube feeding. I had more labs and my blood count was still too low for them to release me. I was given another transfusion. After the transfusion, I felt much better! They discharged me in the evening. I was able to stay in my room as a non-patient (known as ""rooming in"") so that I could visit baby. I started pumping and giving baby some colostrum. Husband was kicked out at this point because of COVID. Baby was being fed formula, which was fine.

3/26 Doctors said if he ate 2oz he could come home. He was at around 1.5oz at this point, I was super excited. I stayed another night in the hospital room pumping and playing Animal Crossing.

3/27 Doctors said if he ate 2.5oz he could come home. He was eating barely over 1.5oz. I felt like I was being strung along at this point,  but they were still tube feeding him and giving him some UV treatments so it was for the best.

3/28 I went home, I couldn't be in the hospital any longer. I was going nuts being all alone, though I did enjoy the company of the NICU nurses who taught me tips and tricks on how to feed and change him. I was feeding him every feed except the 2am feed, because I needed sleep lol.

I visited for a few hours on 3/29, 3/30 and I was informed that if he ate really well the night of 3/30, I could room-in on 3/31 and take him home on 4/1. I brought my bags 3/31 and was so excited. My husband was excited even though he couldn't come to the hospital with me or bring him home with me. When I got to the NICU, a pediatrician and 2 nurses were hovering over his bed talking to themselves. The doctor noticed I had came in and said ""Sorry, you can't stay with him tonight."" He was having a random episode of pauses of breathing (apnea). I was devastated. I held back my tears while the nurses were talking to me but after holding him for an hour or so I went to my car and just cried and cried.

4/1 I was told I could try rooming in again that Friday, 4/3 if he had NO MORE episodes. He did not! I got to room in 4/3 and 4/4 I was promptly rushed out the door alone with my newborn no later than 11am lol, which worked for me because I did NOT want anything to do with the hospital at that point. The hospital gave me a lot of freebies which I'm still using like little breast milk cups and stuff. Bonus!

I'm now 4 weeks postpartum, my hemorrhoid has healed, baby has been home 3 weeks, and life is wonderful. He is such a good baby! But I mostly credit that to the NICU nurses who took care of him during his most critical period. I still get a little dizzy from time to time but my bleeding has stopped completely and I am taking iron supplements. I am exclusively bottle feeding and pumping but I am only getting about 1.5oz of breast milk still due to blood loss and lack of first contact... But it's something, right?

I saw my OB at 2  weeks postpartum and he was shocked. He said in his 20 years of OB, he'd only seen 4 other cases like mine. Me being the 5th. He said only 1.5% of all pregnancies have this complication, and I had none of the risk factors except MAYBE the twin.  He was sorry the pain I was having was definitely due to the accreta, as there might have been internal bleeding going on as well. He said I could have another child 2-3 years down the line and it would be high risk, but accreta shouldn't happen again. This was a huge difference than what the OR doctor had told me in the hospital. I am not sure who is being more conservative and if I really want another baby after all that anyway....

Anyway, my advice to anyone having pains similar to mine, don't try to ignore it and try to push for answers. Also, if you are planning a home birth or some other type of birth not in a hospital and you have any of this pain, don't do it. It's not worth your life! It's hard, and you might get told to just relax and watch Netflix, but get help at the first sign you might need it because if you THINK you do, you do! You are not going to be a burden to anyone.

Trust your gut, I had a feeling baby was coming early, I had his room done at 28 weeks and I went on an Amazon shopping spree to get every last item i needed for him at 30 weeks. Coincidence? I don't know.  I just had one of those feelings. Thanks for reading!",121,38,2020-04-25,gestational age
BabyBumps,Baby is in the 99th percentile for size. I feel like a traumatic birth is inevitable and I‚Äôm scared.,"Gosh, maybe it‚Äôs hormones but I got misty-eyed just writing my post title. 

I‚Äôm a FTM, 30w 3d, and my son is enormous. He‚Äôs measuring four weeks larger than his gestational age. Over the past few months he‚Äôs gone from the 93rd percentile, to the 96th, and now 99th. I was hoping he would slow down but he just keeps getting larger. My OB even sent me to a specialist with one of those fancy 3d ultrasounds, so I don‚Äôt think the estimations are off. 

I do not have gestational diabetes or any health condition that would cause this to happen. They even had me do a 3 hour glucose test to be sure, and I passed with flying colors. I guess it‚Äôs just genetics. I was 9lbs 6oz. My two cousins were over 10 and over 11 lbs respectively (my aunt does have diabetes and obesity). All of us were delivered vaginally and my mom says I was a smooth delivery. 

But I‚Äôm still terrified. I was told by a gynecologist in the past that I have a narrow vagina. So even if my son was not huge, I would be afraid of tearing. It seems inevitable that I‚Äôm going to end up with either a 3rd or 4th degree tear, or I‚Äôll have to have a c-section. He also most likely has a double nuchal cord (nearly impossible to detect for sure even with the fancy ultrasound) which means labor will be even more terrifying for me as I will be in fear of my baby‚Äôs circulation being cut off. My OB tried to reassure me, said that every situation is different, that some people have no trouble delivering a 10 lb baby vaginally and others have trouble with a 6 lb baby. I don‚Äôt know why but I still feel like there‚Äôs no way this is going to go well for me.

Since I‚Äôm a FTM, I‚Äôve been reading birth stories for months in an effort to better prepare myself. I think the stories are fascinating but it‚Äôs not helping my anxiety at all. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm a medical coding auditor. My profession involves reading only the most complicated medical charts, so when I work on delivery cases I never see the ones that go smoothly. That skewed perspective probably isn‚Äôt helping. I‚Äôm planning on doing a tour of the hospital‚Äôs maternity ward with my husband this month, but I don‚Äôt know how much that will help. 

I have 10 weeks to go and I just want to stop being scared. Any advice is very, very appreciated.",30,53,2020-01-03,gestational age
BabyBumps,"Birthed a 10 lb 4 oz babe two weeks ago. Positive, kind of crazy birth story.","Hello all! 

&#x200B;

So I'm going to preface this by saying I'm really effing proud of myself. The end of this pregnancy was cuh-ray-zee. 

&#x200B;

My story starts exactly two months ago, when my two year old heart warrior woke up looking puffy. After a local ER visit it was determined that she had fluid on her heart & we were transferred to children's hospital two hours from home. 

&#x200B;

We are still here üôÉ after a valve replacement, multiple set backs and a hell off a climb by my sweet girl to get back to health, we're finally just a couple days from discharge. üôå

&#x200B;

Since the hospital is 2 hours from home, my husband and I have lived in her hospital room this entire time. I surrendered my worry since I had no control over when I'd go into labor or how long we'd be stuck here. The last few weeks of my pregnancy I would just wake up every morning praying thank you that he wasn't born last night & repeat that when I'd go to bed. Hoping but not setting any expectations that we could be home before he was born. 

&#x200B;

Like the perfect child he is, he held on as long as he could and labor did not start until I was 41 weeks exactly. 

&#x200B;

I had an induction appointment scheduled for mid morning on February 28th but I woke up at around 3 AM and just felt off. I couldn't get comfortable and I woke up my husband and traded the recliner I usually sleep in for the couch but that didn't help. Then I tried climbing in my daughter's hospital bed with her but that didn't work either. Around 5 AM contractions started and were 10 minutes apart. The hospital I was delivering at was a 4 minute drive away. 

&#x200B;

Since I was at 4 cm at my last appointment and this is my 4th delivery, I decided to head out. 

&#x200B;

We had made the decision to have my husband drop me off at L&D and go back to my daughter. My Dad and Sister live nearby but are not fit to be support for the actual birth. My cousin offered to be there too, but after such a long time riding the out of control roller coaster with my daughter's hospital stay, the idea of doing it alone sounded really appealing to me. I'm not sure how to make that idea make sense, other than to say birthing babies is something that makes me feel very powerful and in control as I work with my body and baby. I craved a situation that I felt power in so strongly at that point that I wanted to be alone with it. 

&#x200B;

So I did üôÇ. I spent about an hour laboring in triage before they checked my cervix. Contractions were painful but manageable and the check revealed I was at 6 cm already. So I was sent to a delivery room and labored another hour before I got my epidural. That time was a little stressful because my contractions were ramping up in intensity and 2 minutes apart. I did not want to deliver without the epi. But I got it in time and tried to sleep. 

&#x200B;

About an hour later, I was woken up by intense pressure. All my other kids transitioned in one graceful motion when they were born and I recognized the feeling and knew it was showtime. I'd gone from 7cm and zero station to 10 cm head visible in that hour.

&#x200B;

The doctor took forever to come in and they asked me to not push and that was really hard. I could hear him talking to someone outside my room and wanted to yell for him to hurry the fuck up lol. 

&#x200B;

The nurse coached me through pausing to wait for a contraction to push to prevent tearing and I'm so glad she did. I pushed 4 times and was ready for the 5th and it felt verrrrry intense and I didn't feel like I could progress on that push like I had with the others. The nurses literally bent me in half, feet back by my ears and I was able to push him out on that push. 

&#x200B;

Cade Marcus weighed in at 10 lbs 4 oz with a 14.5 inch head lol. Huge. My other babies were all under 8 lbs. My nurse was right about the pushing, I didn't end up tearing which is a small miracle in my opinion. Haha.

&#x200B;

My family came after that and helped after I got to my recovery room. I had a rough go at first because when my epi was placed, the anesthesiologist unknowingly punctured the dural membrane in my spine and I ended up with a spinal migraine. The puncture caused cerebral fluid to leak through the hole and I had an excruciating headache unless I was laying flat on my back. 

&#x200B;

They did a weird procedure to fix it where they did a second epidural but injected my blood instead of medicine and my blood sealed the hole. Thankfully I got instant relief from it. I guess that complication only has a 1 in 1000 chance of happening. Lucky me. Lol. 

&#x200B;

We're doing our best in this situation as we wait for my daughter to be discharged. The hospital made an exception to the RSV precautions that are in place and allow the baby in my daughter's room with us. So he and I are here during the day and Ronald McDonald House at night and my husband is with my daughter's around the clock. 

&#x200B;

I'm so fucking proud of us both for not only surviving but remaining sane during this whole ordeal. Can't wait to be home! Thanks for reading üôÇ",376,30,2020-03-12,week of birth
BabyBumps,Positive birth story but the week after... Not so much. A bit of cautionary tale,"I'm finally ready to share my story. It's a bit tramautic. Just an FYI myself and baby are doing great but always listen to your gut. Sorry it's so long just putting it all out there in case it may help you! 
Before any of my pregnancy journey started I had heart surgery at 6 months old for a hole that wouldn't close but have been fine since. Fairly common surgery (as far as infant heart surgeries go)
So I want to start by saying my pregnancy and delivery went smoothly. Nothing out of the ordinary.  I had a bit of morning sickness, a bit of heartburn, baby was breech for 90 percent of the pregnancy but she did flip eventually, mild swelling (it was August and very hot) and no high blood pressure until the day before I was induced (the doctor didn't need me to rush over to the hospital but definitely wanted DD out the next day just in case as it was borderline high)
We went to the hospital and I delivered a healthy baby girl who is perfect. We went home and I had read (I believe on a post here) that once you're not pregnant all your symptoms go away. I was so excited for that.... Except I still had heart burn, and slowly every day my swelling was getting worse. I had bought compression socks to use during pregnancy (never did) that I put on because the swelling in my legs became so painful. My chest was hurting but I thought it was muscle strain from labor. I had a tiny cough that was constant ever since I delivered but everyone kept saying it'll go away.
We had been at home a week and because it was late August it was HOT. I however, was freezing I turned off the AC had fuzzy socks over my compression socks, sweats and a hoodie on. I also took one of DDs blankets and wrapped it around my head. I also couldn't stop dry coughing and had taken 3 showers that day because the steam helped. 
Finally it was 11 at night and I had basically a panic attack. I told my husband I thought I should go to the ER because what if it was a cough our baby could get? I mean we were just in a hospital and she was so little! Luckily, my parents could come and pick me up so DH could stay with baby. 
We went to the ER and I was admitted (the whole time anxious because I should just go home and be with my little family not at the ER for what I thought would be bronchitis.)  I was put on oxygen and sent to get a CT scan, because when the nurse had me walk across the hall to the bathroom my oxygen dropped from the low 90s to the mid 60s...
The ER doctor couldn't believe what he was seeing. My aorta was tearing and I had a leaking valve. He initially told me that they were going to take me by ambulance to a hospital in Denver (we live a little over 200 miles away from that city)  then it changed to they we're getting a Life flight ready and I'll be going into emergency heart surgery as soon as I get there...So call your husband but don't let my blood pressure raise I had to stay calm so my heart wouldn't implode.  My dad was awesomely calm and got to walk up to the helicopter pad with me. 
My mom went to be with my daughter (8 days old at that point) and my husband made the 2 hour journey to Denver. Luckily his mom and her husband drove him since he was a bit of a mess (putting it lightly) Thank goodness for family! 
I woke up after an almost 4 hour surgery with a new mechanical valve and lots of tubes. I spent 10 days in the ICU and 3 days in a regular room. My parents drove down with DD so my husband could go be with her in the hotel room a lot. Again it takes a village. I only saw her once there and it was when I got out of the ICU. We took a nap together! She was a great motivation to get better and get out. We now are about 6 months out and doing wonderful. She's so strong and sweet and patient with me while I learn how to be a mom to her while recovering and healing. 
All this to say that if you think something feels wrong even just a cough go to your doctor right away. I'm so so so glad for modern medicine because I wouldn't be here without it. 
PS we got an echocardiogram for DD and her heart is beautiful and healthy!",348,20,2020-02-06,week of birth
BabyBumps,"[TW: hemorrhage, traumatic] Late birth story, 12/11/19. 39+4, FTM, 3.5 weeks of prodromal labor, meconium in water, medicated, partial amniotic sac not breaking, vacuum assisted labor-vacuum popped off, 27 hour labor, 3 hours crowning, fractured pelvis, postpartum hemorrhage, traumatic, long post","Prodromal labor:

I finally worked up the courage to post my birth story! I started having prodromal labor at 36 weeks exactly. Basically it‚Äôs real contractions, not Braxton Hicks, that do not produce cervical change. My contractions lasted 45 seconds-90 seconds and happened every 2 minutes. There were a few days in that 3.5 weeks where my contractions were happening every 15 minutes and that was like heaven! 

I had worked a stressful 12 hour overnight shift as a nurse, and on my way out of the hospital I had to pee. When I walked into the bathroom I felt a gush of fluid.. thought I just peed myself. Then went home and went to sleep. When I woke up I realized I should call my clinic to make sure my water didn‚Äôt break. They scheduled an appointment that afternoon to check. As I was getting ready by sitting on an exercise ball in front of my mirror, the contractions started. I started timing them and realized how close together they were, every 2-3 minutes. I called my husband to come home from work. I tried laying down, drinking water, and taking deep breaths but they didn‚Äôt go away. 

I tried to drive myself to the clinic to meet my husband there, but pulled over after two minutes on the road because it was hard to drive with the contractions. I called the clinic and told them I would be heading to the hospital when my husband got home to drive me. We got to triage in labor and delivery and they saw my contractions in the monitor right away. The nurse was sure with my contractions close together that my water had broken and I was dilated... but nope. I was at 1 cm and the results came back that my water didn‚Äôt break! So I must have just peed myself. 

I followed up with my midwife the next day at the clinic and she said the prodromal labor could last days or weeks. Well it lasted 3.5 weeks lol. I was actually feeling great with my pregnancy until the prodromal labor happened and I was miserable. It was harder to work, harder to sleep, harder to move. But I was also relieved my baby girl stayed in me longer!

Real contractions and labor:

On Monday while eating dinner, I noticed that the contractions felt a little different and the location was slightly different on my abdomen. My midwife said I may not know when I really go into labor, so I took this as a sign. I went into triage that night and called into work sick. At triage, I was still at 1cm but the nurse said said she could feel that I was really in labor this time. So I decided to go home and labor at home a little longer since I had made it this far. The next day around dinner time, my baby girl moved and I instantly had terrible back labor that got really painful and intense! I thought I would have time to shower but I went upstairs and said nope and told my husband we needed to go to the hospital NOW. The car ride was painful because I had to sit the whole time and with the back labor I needed to move around. 

Water breaking, meconium:

Right as I was walking up to the desk in triage around 6 pm. I told my husband that either I peed myself or my water just broke... so I asked the nurse if I could go to the bathroom. I wiped and it was really green and not just fluid in my underwear. I came back and told the nurse and she said it was probably meconium. They checked for meconium and to see if my water broke and they both came back positive! I was disappointed I was only dilated at 3cm though. The nurses were super rude though unfortunately in triage this night. I sat in the triage room for 1.5 hours. I kept asking since everything was positive if I could walk around to labor or move to the room I was being admitted to yet. They said no that I had to stay in bed so they could keep monitoring contractions. With the back labor it was so hard. I didn‚Äôt take Lamaze classes, so it took me a while to figure out that I needed to breathe really, really slow instead of fast. Once I figured that out, the pain was slightly less. 

Epidural:

They finally admitted me and got me to a room. They wanted to start the epidural right away. I was at 4 cm at this point. I did ask if I could wait until I was dilated to a 5 or 6 so I could labor while moving around and they said they wanted to start it right away because they may have to induce me with all of the meconium and because my water broke. I gave in. I really wish I would have waited until I was at least 5-6 cm before I got the epidural. Laboring in bed was hard. 

Placing the epidural was okay. You just need a lot of patience to sit still through contractions while they are placing it. Unfortunately, the epidural did not work well for me. Either it was placed incorrectly (which they kept checking and said it wasn‚Äôt) or the medication just didn‚Äôt work for me. They kept having to bolus me because when the bolus wore completely off after about 45 minutes-1.5 hours, I could feel everything. The basal rate didn‚Äôt help either. I got 6 boluses total and they said that was super abnormal. Every time I got a bolus, I needed more 500 more mLs of fluid too. So they were pumping lots of fluid in me and I felt heavy. The catheter placement wasn‚Äôt bad once the epidural kicked in. It was nice not to worry about having to use the bathroom. 

Induced with Pitocin, partial amniotic sac not broken:

They started pitocin around 9 pm to get things moving. I labored all night with no change in dilation. It was a huge bummer. I was woken up every hour to turn and the epidural kept wearing off so I was in pain. I only slept like 45min-1 hour the whole night. They finally realized around 5 am that part of amniotic sac did not break and had moved in front of my baby‚Äôs head. They said it‚Äôs pretty rare that that happens. Because it was in front of her head, my body wasn‚Äôt dilating more. Her head wasn‚Äôt putting enough pressure to dilate me more with each contraction while it was there. 

Even though they had pitocin running since about 9 pm, I was still only at 4 cm at this point. The nurses aren‚Äôt allowed to break my water, so when my midwife came in at 8 am she broke the sac. She had a hard time with it too. I labored all morning and they decided to increase the pitocin rapidly. I hate throwing up and I was puking through the whole labor. Thank goodness for the popsicles. The cold helped the nausea a lot. 

Dilated at 10 cm:

In the afternoon around like 2-3 pm, the nurse said I was dilated to a 10. I had been waiting for her to come in because my LO had moved and my back labor was getting excruciating. I was almost in tears. She told me I needed to start pushing right away but I told her I needed another bolus in the epidural before I start pushing. She told me there wasn‚Äôt time. I asked how long labor usually lasts for a FTM and she said 1-2 hours. I started crying and said I couldn‚Äôt do it. I was in so much pain. She told me I had to start pushing and so I tried, but I was crying in pain. 

The position my LO had moved to was hurting my left lower back so badly I couldn‚Äôt push effectively. The nurse seemed annoyed and told me that if I couldn‚Äôt push then I would need a c-section. I told her if I got a bolus in the epidural then I would be able to push. I told her I wanted a vaginal delivery not a c-section. She finally started aged the anesthesiologist to do another bolus. It is hard to advocate for yourself when you feel vulnerable like that. Wish I would have spoken up more. I was also frustrated because I never got the urge to push, I got to 10 and they told me I had to start pushing. Wish I would have waited to feel the urge to push.

Crowning for 3 hours:

My midwife got there about 30 minutes after I started pushing-she had been assisting another mom. Oh and I did poop at the beginning of pushing and I know my husband saw it. Embarrassing lol. When my midwife got there she said I was doing great! My baby was already crowning, I could see her head in the mirror and feel her hair. My midwife told me that this would be a fast delivery for a FTM and my LO should be out by 1 hour of pushing. She was wrong. 

I pushed in as many positions as I could with the epidural. I pushed 4 times for 10 seconds each with each contraction every 2-3 minutes. So I was pushing for 40 seconds every 2-3 minutes. My midwife said my daughter was just slightly turned to the side. She would not slip under my pubic bone no matter how long or hard I pushed. I was super motivated to meet my daughter so I gave everything I had. After crowning with her head partially out for 3 hours, they called in an OB from my clinic. 

Vacuum assisted:

The OB and my midwife told me they would like to try vacuum assisted delivery to get my baby girl out safely. I was hesitant and told them I‚Äôd like to try pushing a few more times. I gave 150% but she was still in the same position so I agreed. I wish I had looked up vacuum assisted delivery beforehand. The OB put it on my LOs head and was in a standing position pulling as hard as she could with each push (imagine tug-a-war pulling). She did this 4 times and then we heard the loudest ‚Äúpop‚Äù ever. My husband and I looked down terrified. We both thought our baby‚Äôs head popped off... I‚Äôm serious it was that loud. I asked if everything was okay. I almost had a heart attack. My midwife said, ‚Äúoh that happens sometimes, the vacuum just popped off‚Äù. 

So they decided against using the vacuum again (my midwife told me later that the OB made a really good decision by stopping. She said that some OBs will let the vacuum pop off 3 or more times before stopping... she said the recommended practice is to stop after it pops off once). 

Delivery:

They told me I had to push with everything I had to get her out. And I did. I pushed 4 more times and before I knew it my sweet girls was on top of me. (I was so proud of myself because I never took a break and pushed every 2-3 minutes. I‚Äôm proud I got her out myself at the end too). Those last 3 hours were so painful with her entire head crowning for that long-nonstop ring of fire (the only thing I can say to describe it is it felt like teeth biting and scraping my skin and bones constantly), there was a little relief when she came out. 

The vacuum must have loosened her up a little. I saw that the OB had her shoulders, then I looked at my husband who started crying and said, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs so pretty‚Äù. And I pushed again and looked back and she was on my chest. She was covered in meconium lol. They had to quick take her off of me and wipe her down. She was pooping as she came out too. I am so thankful that my sweet girl was doing well throughout all of this. Her heart rate stayed the same the whole time and she was a happy camper through the whole delivery. 

There were 6 people from the NICU in my room because they thought for sure that she would need to go to the NICU based off of how much meconium there was in my water breaking and on her. But she was healthy as could be. Best moment of my life was seeing her on my chest and touching her for the first time. My husband and I were both crying. My husband was crying so hard that when the doctor asked what her name is, my husband couldn‚Äôt get the words out because he was crying so hard.

Postpartum hemorrhage:

As I am holding my baby girl on my chest and admiring her with my husband, I take a peek around my baby to see my placenta coming out. The OB held it up and it was covered in blood and blood was coming off of it like a waterfall. I saw the OBs eyes get wide and then I remember like 25 people rushing in my room. I tried to just stare at my baby and focus on her. It was hard though because the OB was looking for a tear inside me because she couldn‚Äôt get the bleeding to stop. She was double fisted punching my uterus from the inside and 4 or 5 nurses were pushing on my abdomen from the outside. 

Then orders started getting yelled out and people were running in and out of the room like crazy. I was still trying to focus on my daughter through the pain of pushing on my abdomen and insides. They put a medication up my butt, I got at least 2 shots and they ramped you the pitocin again. It took about 1-1.5 hours but they got the bleeding under control. Thank goodness. 

The doctor started to stitch me up because I had two second degree tears. Since the epidural wore off this was pretty painful. Still trying to focus on my daughter... until I felt nauseous. I yelled out for someone to pick up my daughter because I was going to vomit. It took like 20 seconds before someone took her and no one could find an emesis bag. I tried to sit up a little or turn to the side but the nurses held me down and wouldn‚Äôt let me turn to the side because the doctor was stitching me up. So I projectile vomited a ton into the air, which fell all back down on my face and hair. I was covered in puke. Thankful I didn‚Äôt puke on my baby, but I felt disgusting. 

I am so very thankful to the OB who acted quickly and got my postpartum hemorrhage under control. She probably saved my life. My husband said the floor was absolutely covered in blood everywhere. I didn‚Äôt even honestly know I was hemorrhaging until after the OB was done stitching me up, she told me that I hemorrhaged badly and they would be watching my hemoglobin levels. The OB said I hemorrhaged 1,942 mLs of blood, severe. When I arrived in triage, my hemoglobin was 12.8, by the time I left the hospital it dropped to 6.9. I lost almost half my blood volume at the hospital. She told me that my uterus was just really boggy and tired from the labor. So that‚Äôs what caused the contractions. I thanked her and she and tons of people started to leave the room. 

Then I started to fade away... I couldn‚Äôt keep my eyes open anymore. I felt weak and felt myself slipping away. My husband was holding my baby at this point. I slowly felt myself float outside my body and I was looking down at myself and seeing the room from a Birdseye view. I kept telling myself how great my husband looked with my LO. And how when I am gone, he would be able to take care of her by himself. I kept thinking about how he would be a great dad. These thoughts kept going through my mind over and over again for a long while as I watched over my body and my husband and the two nurses. 

Then I slowly slipped back into my body at some point but was still not totally there. I was so weak I couldn‚Äôt open my eyes yet. I could hear the nurse grab my phone to take pictures of my husband with the baby, my husband told her the password to unlock it. 

Another hour or two went by and I opened my eyes. I was nauseous and threw up again. I asked for some ibuprofen and Zofran. Once I got those, I asked to hold my daughter again. I was still out of it and really weak, but I wanted to see her. I held her and she was just as beautiful as I remembered. The nurse helped me latch her to breastfeed and she did great. She latched right away. After I breastfed they brought me upstairs, it was around 1 am.

I decided beforehand to wait until my baby arrived before telling family and I‚Äôm glad I did. I would have been jealous and upset if they were able to bond with her before I felt good enough or ready to. We did tell family and had them come but I honestly wish I hadn‚Äôt because I badly needed to heal during my stay in the hospital. My midwife saw me the next morning and kissed my forehead and told me I did great. It was nice of her. The whole hospitalization I was weak. Could barely walk, was super pale, and barely slept. It was tough. I had to stay an extra few days to monitor my hemoglobin levels.

Discharge home:

I had my daughter on Wednesday and we discharged home on Saturday. When I got home it was hard because I was in so much pain I could barely move. My husband had to help bring me to the bathroom, to the shower, to the couch, and to bed. My left leg didn‚Äôt work. Like I could not lift it (that lasted for 2 weeks and I still have difficulty moving it a lot). 

About a week postpartum I thought I could stand up in front of the toilet and get back to the couch by myself. So I stood up and the rug underneath me slid. I did the splits. I yelled out and cried in pain because it hurt and scared me so bad. My husband rushed to my side. I couldn‚Äôt stop crying for a couple of hours. My husband finally said, ‚Äúwhat is wrong, are you okay?‚Äù I turned to him while crying and said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a normal birth. I‚Äôm traumatized and haven‚Äôt had time to cope. I need to cry about it.‚Äù His response was, ‚Äúwhat do you mean that wasn‚Äôt a normal birth?‚Äù Face palm. I explained it to him and he was shocked. Men can be so oblivious. For some reason I thought he knew I left my body but he didn‚Äôt obviously didn‚Äôt haha. He was and is super supportive. I‚Äôm very lucky to have him.

Fractured pelvis, re-tearing:

It took about 9 weeks before I could walk around again and feel like myself, kinda. Talked with my midwife about my pain and I fractured my pelvis during labor. Still healing a bit now and carrying the car seat is still difficult. I ended up re-tearing my stitches passing a bowel movement at 5 weeks postpartum. They couldn‚Äôt re-stitch me because it had been too long, so I had a gaping hole between my vagina and anus for a while lol. It has come together and healed with time. My body was not ready to go back to work and take care of patients at 12 weeks. 

Also tried sex twice and it is super painful and had to stop. Hope that goes away at some point! Also wish people would stop asking if I am going to have another baby right now or right away.. I need to heal for a while. It‚Äôs already super messed up that my brain is slowly trying to forget the details of my labor and convincing me I want more children. Especially since for about 3 weeks postpartum I was considered never having more children. My milk also didn‚Äôt come in until day 14 because of the pitocin and hemorrhage, so breastfeeding has been a challenge. Still breastfeeding, but needing to supplement with formula. 

I am thankful that I have a healthy baby girl and she was healthy throughout my labor. Praying my next labor is easy and uneventful, my recovery is better, and I can actually care for my baby better after birth. I went into this labor with an open mind about what could happen, but more happened than I imagined. I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm alive. It was a scary feeling after losing all of that blood. Glad I was in the hospital because I may not have survived if I gave birth at home.

It was all worth it for my sweet baby born on 12/11 at 7:07 pm, 7 lbs 8 oz and 20 inches long. Bring a mom is the best decision I‚Äôve ever made.


TLDR: 3.5 weeks of prodromal labor, baby moved and had real labor with back labor-super painful. Water broke walking into triage, meconium in water, induced with pitocin, epidural placed but didn‚Äôt work-needed to be rebolused 6 times, part of amniotic sac didn‚Äôt break and was in front of baby‚Äôs head preventing further dilation-broken by midwife, asked to push before I got the urge to push, 3 hours of baby crowning, needed vacuum assisted delivery-loudest ‚Äúpop‚Äù ever and vacuum popped off, delivered baby girl on my own after that, my baby was beautiful, projective vomited on myself, severe postpartum hemorrhage 1,942 mL blood loss due to tired uterus, out of body experience-felt like I was going to die, two 2nd degree tears, fractured pelvis from labor, re-tore at home-couldn‚Äôt be re-stitched, Sore and unable to move at home for weeks, delayed milk supply. Baby girl born on 12/11 at 7:07 pm, 7 lbs 8 oz, 20 inches and healthy and beautiful as could be.

BabyBumps,"Holy crap, I just found out TODAY I'm pregnant at 30 weeks along. I've had zero symptoms and was told I would never again be able to get pregnant. I am completely freaking out. Help? Stories? Advice?","2 weeks ago I took an at home test only because my breasts were hurting and my boyfriend urged me to. I was thinking it was pointless, but made him happy so I did. It came out positive to my surprise and a few days later I was at my PCP doing a blood work test to confirm pregnancy. Hcg came back at 17k, confirmed and estimated at 8-10 weeks pregnant.  
Fast forward to today, I go to get an ultrasound at the pregnancy support center cause I can definitely feel the baby kick and had a ""feeling"" I was further along than 10 weeks. I was expecting to be maybe 13-14 weeks. 

Nope. 

Dr estimated after measuring the baby that I'm at least 30 WEEKS and the baby is around 3.5 lbs!!!

The whole point of this post is to rant I guess because it‚Äôs so fucking annoying. Just being around someone who sighs whenever they see you eat is fucking obnoxious.

I‚Äôm staying here until the baby can get some vaccinations and then my husband and I are moving out of state.

BabyBumps,Unexpectedly delivering alone: The COVID-19 birth story (crosspost from April2020bumpers - very positive),"My husband tested positive for COVID-19 so I called the hospital to be told they had a quarentined labour and delivery room and it would be no problem.  The next morning (28.03.2020) I went into labour. When I arrived at the hospital 6 hours into labour at 38+2 the hospital decided they had changed their minds and my husband could no longer join me after I had already left him in the car to go check in.

What you might be expecting is a sad and traumatic birth story but too be honest it was the most empowering thing I've ever done in my life. 

It took me about 3 or 4 hours of video calling my husband, parents and sister to calm down and accept that this baby was coming either way so I needed to come to terms with it. My labour progressed incredibly slowly and I had contractions  5 minutes apart from 7am until around 10pm on day one. At 10pm I was only 3cm dilated so was offered oxytocin to speed up contractions or mild pain relief so I could sleep and see how things progressed. My waters had broken at 10am and so I couldn't leave the hospital and was on regular antibiotics. I decided to let my body decide how things progressed and took some pain relief that allowed me to sleep until 12.30. I then dozed between contractions until 4.30am. 

At 4.30 I was still only 3cm dilated and was offered oxytocin again which I turned down. I managed to breathe through the contractions until 5.30am when I took another dose of pain relief and slept for another hour. These contractions were a real turning point for my mental and emotional state. I wanted my husband to rest so he could be with me for the big day to come and so I focused myself and worked through them alone. I allowed myself to see how strong and capable I really was. 

At 10am my contractions were steady and mild still but I had made it to 6cm dilated. The hospital had to give me oxytocin at this point as my waters had been broken for 24 hours. Over the next 4 hours my contractions became much stronger and more regular and I dilated to 8cm by about 3.30pm. I took one more dose of pain relief at 2.30pm - it was too mild to help the contentions but allowed me to feel calm in the breaks. Throughout the whole day my husband was on video call and talked me through contractions giving me words of support. 

At 4.30pm my contractions were very strong and I could no longer communicate much with my husband. I had short 1 minute breaks between them  but unfortunately was still only 9cm dilated. At this point my midwife and doctor strongly recommended that I took an epidural due to the length of my labour and the strength of the contractions (added to the fact that I was alone they were very worried I was going to become exhausted). I turned down the epidural and decided to power through. The final cm of dilation was incredibly painful, I was in a quarantined room and only had one midwife able to be present with me so when she had to leave me to prepare the room for birth I found dealing with these last contractions alone very difficult. I allowed the idea of giving up enter my head for 1 second before I banished it forever. 

It was finally time to push. A doctor put on protective gear and the three of us were locked away in our quarantined room with my husband on video call at the head of the bed. I had to push for around 30 minutes and required manual help for around 3 or 4 contractions from the doctor. Team green gained a little girl called Katalina Grace at 18.01. 

Unfortunately she had some difficulty breathing and a mild infection from my waters. She was whisked away before I could touch her and taken to the intermediate care ward which I wasn't allowed to access due to the quarantine. She weighed in at 7lbs 5.5oz and 50cm and during the night she recovered to full health. I am met her for the first time st 1pm the following day.

Don't get me wrong, giving birth alone was the last thing I thought I could cope with, and at times it seemed like I was facing an impossible task but to reassure any mamas out there that may be facing the same thing, you've got this. You are strong and you are capable. I will never forget the strength I found within myself and  I have made my husband and family immeasurably proud; they are in awe of me. If I'm honest, I'm in awe of myself and I now know that I can conquer whatever life throws at me. Please get in touch with me if you are scared or end up in a similar position. 

At the end of 36 of the hardest hours of my life I have a beautiful little girl that will always know how hard her mummy worked for her and the love that surrounded it all.",434,30,2020-04-01,full term birth
BabyBumps,34+6 preterm birth‚Äîtraumatic right now but will be okay. Our sweet Jude has arrived and I may be transported to his hospital today!,"Yesterday morning at about this time (4:50 am EST) I woke up to cramping in my back that I noticed was very regular, around 7 minutes apart, and sometimes down my legs. I had irritable uterus so I just convinced myself that‚Äôs all it was. My dad was over helping me with my 2.5 year old son because I‚Äôve been on bedrest trying to keep that second little boy inside longer for the last three weeks. Around 8:45 my dad finally convinced me I should call my doctor and give them a heads up. They gave me an hour and a few home remedies to try before calling back. Nothing worked so I called back at 10am and they said head to L&D to be safe. I threw a few more ‚Äúmight want it‚Äù things in my hospital bag ‚Äújust in case‚Äù still not actually believing this was serious and that I was just being dramatic. Ha. Dumb me. Dad drops me off at the hospital (husband is the only allowed visitor and he‚Äôs a nurse practitioner so was finishing rounds before coming because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs nothing he‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Hahahaha. Nope. Big fat jokes on us.

I‚Äôve been timing in my head because I‚Äôm a genius but by the time I was checked in and in triage I was contracting three minutes apart not five like I thought and they were getting pretty Uncomfortable. Midwife and nurse both checked me and told me I was in labor for real and they were going to start the meds to stop it. We started with two doses of procardia very close together and me drinking insane amounts of water. Nope. Contractions now 2 minutes apart and sometimes doubling up. Got a shot of turbutaline (not sure if that‚Äôs spelled right) and steroids in my leg to try to take the next serious step. That didn‚Äôt work at all either. Sometime in between procardia and the shots my husband showed up but I can‚Äôt remember when. We realize about thirty minutes after the shot that shit is getting real and things are NOT GOOD at this point because we know we have a white male baby in there and as premies they struggle. I have full blown panic attack. At this point ‚Äújust in case‚Äù they brought me consent forms for everything. I had chosen not to VBAC which turned out great because my dilation was extremely painful and sporadic due to massive scar tissue from a poorly inserted IUD in my twenties. I don‚Äôt remember dilation at the end of this. It became a blur of fear.

I think at about 3:15 the OB came in with the midwife and they decided to give me morphine as a very last ditch effort to calm my body down and at least buy us until the next day because every single day counts. The morphine made it so I could be calm during breaks from contractions (aka be high off my ass and somehow no one thought to take my phone away so there‚Äôs embarrassing shit in there) but there was no change in spacing and they were doubling up nearly every time. So the call was made, baby wasn‚Äôt waiting and this was happening now. I did okay with this right up until we got into the OR when I suddenly had flashbacks to my first son‚Äôs c section in which I bled out, lost consciousness, and didn‚Äôt wake up for twelve hours. Absolutely lost my shit. But my nurse and the CRNA were so so so kind. They placed my spinal block and hugged me tight until I was ready to lay down and just let me sob until I was calm. Everyone through all of this has been incredible. 

The best surprise to happen during all of this‚Äîin walks my husband in his own PPE from work!!! He talked to the OB, they talked to his boss, and he got special permission to be in the OR in the restrictions currently placed because of his job and because he had full sterile PPE in his car with him from working two doors down from the hospital in a hospital facility. Huge huge huge relief. It was awful preparing to deliver a very early baby alone.

The c section went beautifully and they honored my request without hesitation to tie and burn and partially remove my tubes (see my post history‚ÄîI suck at being pregnant). I was awake the whole time and I got to hear his beautiful cry and I remember the exact moment they held him up for me to see and then brought him over to me before taking him to the level 2 nicu here. After twelve hours of hard labor and no successful interventions, he was born a little after 5pm weighing 5lb15oz and 19.5 inches long!!

I don‚Äôt bleed at all in an abnormal way this time so recovery is going easier. We think all is good, he‚Äôs just on CPAP getting a little help breathing. I start asking to pump for him...and his doctor walks in and I knew from the look on his face things had changed. It was just that look they have when they have to tell you news they really wish they didn‚Äôt. Baby was really struggling to breathe on CPAP and just working way too hard, so the level 3 nicu 1.5 hours away was making him a room and sending a life flight team for him. I couldn‚Äôt leave this hospital so soon after delivery. We were going to have to say goodbye. They wheeled me to him to spend as much time as possible with him before he had to go. Walking into the nicu knowing I couldn‚Äôt hold him yet and seeing him fight so hard for air...I fell apart massively. I felt like I had failed by not keeping him inside and this is all my fault. It was the second worst moment of my life. We got to spend 45 minutes before the life flight team arrived to get him ready and leaving that room was torture. They were intubating him and didn‚Äôt want me to see that.

We waited back in my room for a good hour and a half and I kept thinking ‚Äúthis is good because they‚Äôd already be out of here if he was really really bad‚Äù to reassure myself. Then they brought him in to say goodbye. And that‚Äôs the actual worst moment of my life. I am absolutely shattered over the separation and how hard he‚Äôs working just to breathe. Just completely heartbroken in a whole new way. He was on the ventilator and looked more comfortable, but oh god the machines and tubes all over his tiny body üò≠ I can‚Äôt even handle that mental image.

I managed to pump 8ml for him finally while we waited for the team and my husband (who I sent with him) to call me and give me an update. My dad shows up. The hospital made another exception and got the director to override the no transfer of visitors rule so I didn‚Äôt have to be here all alone. I am so thankful I have my daddy here right now. I know I could do this alone but it‚Äôs brutal enough as it is. The vent seemed to help him immensely by about 1:20 am when we finally got the update. My doctor tells me she thinks I should take some ambien so that I can get some sleep after the trauma of the day and I agree because I can feel how tired I am but also can‚Äôt get my brain to shut up about how awful everything felt. I fell asleep and my nurse who I adore and my friend who happens to be a nurse on this floor tonight too both come in to give me meds and hugs and assure me it‚Äôs okay to go to sleep and Jude needs me to rest enough to safely get out of here to go see him soon. I finally pass out I think around 2 after another good cry. 

It‚Äôs now 5:30am and I woke up around 4:45 just in time for pain control which is good because I‚Äôm extremely sore at this point. I think adrenaline and fear blocked a lot of the pain last night. I‚Äôm hoping that by some miracle I get discharged today so that I can go see him and be with him at his hospital but I know I can‚Äôt rush my own healing too dangerously because then we have another big fat emergency to manage.

He‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous but I‚Äôm not ready to share pictures of him yet. He actually looks like a full term baby instead of a premie somehow but it just feels too sacred to share what we have now. My parents told family and told everyone to leave me alone for a while, and I told a few friends who are now the friend filters to keep me from getting bombarded. I just want to hold my baby and I don‚Äôt give a damn about anyone else right now other than my new little family of four. Not actually...but I just don‚Äôt have the capacity to talk to anyone. 

We are so lucky and so many early babies struggle more than he is and I know that. I‚Äôm trying to focus on the good. But damn is it hard in the moment to see past your own moment of trauma. I‚Äôm trying. And I‚Äôm trying to let go of the guilt. I kept him in three weeks longer than his first attempt and those three weeks were huge. I‚Äôm trying to focus on how I succeeded there and not how I failed to go farther. 

April fools day is my least favorite day of the year and somehow I ended up having an April fools day baby. I hoped I would wake up today and it would have been a terrible prank someone pulled on me somehow and I would still be pregnant and he would still be safe inside of me but that didn‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs very real.

I love my little boys. I cannot wait to be with my newest again. Being separated like this feels so unnatural. Someday I‚Äôll be okay again but right now I‚Äôm not and I just needed to write it out where I could without needing to talk to a bunch of IRL people and answer all of their questions. If you‚Äôre the praying type, my family would love every prayer you can offer for him. I‚Äôm not ready for dm‚Äôs or talking to people about this yet but I‚Äôm sure soon I‚Äôll need some kind of support so prior nicu parents feel free to comment if you‚Äôre up for talking when I‚Äôm ready.

Thank you all. Hoping to go pump more and maybe get a little more sleep.",257,20,2020-04-02,full term birth
BabyBumps,They forgot to notify me about my induction date... surprise!,"So I went into my 39 week appt yesterday afternoon and was almost too late to make it thanks to a delivery truck blocking the exit of my apartment complex and other fun traffic mishaps. I called and they said you have to be here by 4 for the doc to see you. I got in at 4:02 and sat my swollen ass down like dont even play me right now I'm full term and seeing my doctor, idc!!

The doctor walks in and says ""you're so close! You can see the light at the end of the tunnel huh?"" And I'm like ehh can I? She says ""since your inducing on Sunday night, please call 2 hours ahead..."" she trails off after noticing the look of panic on me and my husband's faces and realizes we had no idea about this induction which has been scheduled for a week now!

They forgot to send me a notice about the induction date. I've been panicked everyday waiting for labor as my docs were all in agreement that if I wanted to have a natural labor, it needed to happen within the 40 week mark.

Well we have less than 2 days to prepare and come to terms with the impending reality that I'm going to have a likely long labor in the hospital and will not be laboring at home. The good news is I progressed to 3 cm and 50% effaced. She did a membrane sweep to speed things along.

The funny thing is I would have missed my own induction if they didnt let me see the doc because I was 10 minutes late for the appt. 

Wish me luck ladies and godspeed to the rest of you watching for labor symptoms!",81,28,2020-01-04,full term birth
BabyBumps,Positive birth story but the week after... Not so much. A bit of cautionary tale,"I'm finally ready to share my story. It's a bit tramautic. Just an FYI myself and baby are doing great but always listen to your gut. Sorry it's so long just putting it all out there in case it may help you! 
Before any of my pregnancy journey started I had heart surgery at 6 months old for a hole that wouldn't close but have been fine since. Fairly common surgery (as far as infant heart surgeries go)
So I want to start by saying my pregnancy and delivery went smoothly. Nothing out of the ordinary.  I had a bit of morning sickness, a bit of heartburn, baby was breech for 90 percent of the pregnancy but she did flip eventually, mild swelling (it was August and very hot) and no high blood pressure until the day before I was induced (the doctor didn't need me to rush over to the hospital but definitely wanted DD out the next day just in case as it was borderline high)
We went to the hospital and I delivered a healthy baby girl who is perfect. We went home and I had read (I believe on a post here) that once you're not pregnant all your symptoms go away. I was so excited for that.... Except I still had heart burn, and slowly every day my swelling was getting worse. I had bought compression socks to use during pregnancy (never did) that I put on because the swelling in my legs became so painful. My chest was hurting but I thought it was muscle strain from labor. I had a tiny cough that was constant ever since I delivered but everyone kept saying it'll go away.
We had been at home a week and because it was late August it was HOT. I however, was freezing I turned off the AC had fuzzy socks over my compression socks, sweats and a hoodie on. I also took one of DDs blankets and wrapped it around my head. I also couldn't stop dry coughing and had taken 3 showers that day because the steam helped. 
Finally it was 11 at night and I had basically a panic attack. I told my husband I thought I should go to the ER because what if it was a cough our baby could get? I mean we were just in a hospital and she was so little! Luckily, my parents could come and pick me up so DH could stay with baby. 
We went to the ER and I was admitted (the whole time anxious because I should just go home and be with my little family not at the ER for what I thought would be bronchitis.)  I was put on oxygen and sent to get a CT scan, because when the nurse had me walk across the hall to the bathroom my oxygen dropped from the low 90s to the mid 60s...
The ER doctor couldn't believe what he was seeing. My aorta was tearing and I had a leaking valve. He initially told me that they were going to take me by ambulance to a hospital in Denver (we live a little over 200 miles away from that city)  then it changed to they we're getting a Life flight ready and I'll be going into emergency heart surgery as soon as I get there...So call your husband but don't let my blood pressure raise I had to stay calm so my heart wouldn't implode.  My dad was awesomely calm and got to walk up to the helicopter pad with me. 
My mom went to be with my daughter (8 days old at that point) and my husband made the 2 hour journey to Denver. Luckily his mom and her husband drove him since he was a bit of a mess (putting it lightly) Thank goodness for family! 
I woke up after an almost 4 hour surgery with a new mechanical valve and lots of tubes. I spent 10 days in the ICU and 3 days in a regular room. My parents drove down with DD so my husband could go be with her in the hotel room a lot. Again it takes a village. I only saw her once there and it was when I got out of the ICU. We took a nap together! She was a great motivation to get better and get out. We now are about 6 months out and doing wonderful. She's so strong and sweet and patient with me while I learn how to be a mom to her while recovering and healing. 
All this to say that if you think something feels wrong even just a cough go to your doctor right away. I'm so so so glad for modern medicine because I wouldn't be here without it. 
PS we got an echocardiogram for DD and her heart is beautiful and healthy!",345,20,2020-02-06,late delivery
AskDocs,"I am pregnant and had to wean off of my adderall, how long until it's cleared from the baby's system and will be withdraw from Prozac?","31 female, white
About 200 pounds, 5'1.
Never smoker, occasional drinker but not since AI got pregnant.
Medications are: Prozac 60mg, ambien 2.5mg-5 MG as needed for sleep. Tylenol as needed, famotadine and tums as needed (but daily almost), and I've had to take vistaril 25mg for a break through anxiety attack a few weeks ago. (discontinued) Adderall regular 10mg up to 3x a day weaned off over about a month

I have a history of anxiety, adhd, severe depression, post partum depression from my last pregnancy. 

Current conditions 26 weeks pregnant (due in July) and have been on pelvic rest and light duty since late December due to bleeding and losing blood clots. OBGYN checked thoroughly and ultrasounds show health cervix, no issues, and a visual examination of my cervix and vaginal walls are intact and no tearing, so it was ruled a ""leaky blood vessel"". Amniotic fluid is great, and anatomy scan showed a very healthy, organs all in place with good blood flow, baby boy. 

Bit of back story - I found out I was pregnant in December when I was further along than I realized because I was still having a ""period"" (the spotting and bleeding I was experiencing that ultimately put me on pelvic rest a few weeks later). Okay so I have been on Prozac since before I gave birth to my second child in Nov 2016, I want to say I started it in late September because my depression was making me go a little crazy. Our home flooded in Louisiana so add that to the stress of a new baby. That baby did great, and I stayed on my low dose of Prozac for almost a year claiming things were fine but was really dealing with serious PPD. I finally stepped up and got help and since then I am now up to 60mg of Prozac daily. My insurance does not cover any name adhd medications or XR, so I have been on 10 MG Adderall up to 3x a day for about 2ish years. 

When I found out I was pregnant, I didn't want to just stop taking the Adderall so I decided it was best for me to slowly wean off. In the past if I abruptly stopped I had some really angry withdrawal symptoms, so I talked it over with my OB and Pysch and while understanding the risks, I weaned off much slower than I maybe should have. But I'm finally off of it. However after what happened during my last pregnancy I felt it was safer for me to stay on that treatment, because if I tried to do without medication again I was terrified of what I'd do to myself or my unborn baby. I had full support from both doctors. Well, the support that is tied with their cautions of course.

Okay so I stopped taking the Adderall around January/February-ish, but still on Prozac. I know both can cause the baby to withdraw once he's born. How long would the Adderall be effective in his system if I stopped taking it in January and presumably go full term to July, is there a risk he would still have any in his system to cause him to withdraw? Would the Prozac exacerbate anything or bc the Prozac is still in my system so it would be in his, would that affect how the Adderall leaves? And with the Adderall being a low dose to begin with then wean down to, does that make a difference as to whether he may withdraw at all from it? How many weeks does it take to clear their system in utero? I've seen reports that some women are going into preterm labor when they got sick so if I somehow deliver early could the Adderall still be there? 

I figure there's a chance he will withdraw from the Prozac, and I feel ashamed I still have to take it but I can't put my family through that again. My 7 year old son was terrified of me for weeks after. I just know amphetamines can be worse when it comes to withdrawing in infants so to combine the two now is really scaring me. Thank you for any help.

AskDocs,Autoimmune? Genetic? Munchausen's?,"My 12yo son has some weird med history and lab results - trying to see what labs and/or referrals I should ask about at upcoming appointment.

History:
Easy pregnancy & delivery. Considered SGA at birth (in the 4th percentile). APGARs 8 and 9. Placenta had ""fatty deposit"" and umbilical cord was abnormal - more straight than twisted, one part came away for a small portion then came back in (like it made the letter P). Pathology of placenta was normal, but they did not test for CMV. Doubled birth weight by 2 months, met all milestones, no concerns other than being a really rashy baby/kid.

Age 6:
- Diagnosed with combined type ADHD.
- Diagnosed with Benign Rolandic Epilepsy, started Keppra 

Age 7: 
- Diagnosed with ESES/CSWS epilepsy, treated with Keppra and high dose Valium. Brain MRI normal
- Diagnosed with Premature Andrenarchy. Doctors blame epilepsy.
- Significant behavioral issues at home, too much anxiety at school to act out.
- Still very rashy. New rash begins: hives when exposed to cold.
- Starts taking daily Zyrtec for cold urticaria and general hay fever.

Age 9:
- Declared epilepsy free. Stopped all epilepsy meds.
- Significant behavioral issues continued. 
- Eval'd for autism. ADOS-2 score came back slightly on spectrum, but was instead diagnosed with Mixed Expressive-Receptive Language Disorder and Generalized Anxiety.
- Still very rashy

Fast forward to within the last year:
- Two random incidents of joints swelling (wrist and knee) with no known injuries. Labs for JRA came back normal.
- Complains of frequent stomach aches. Requested Celiac panel. Gliadin IGA antibodies came back slightly elevated TWICE on panels a month apart. IGG levels and the other IGA level all normal on both panels.
- Still very rashy
- Still lots of behavioral issues at home. Starts intense outpatient program and psych gives several lab orders, some of which come back abnormal:
        - Vitamin D very low (not a shock, we are in the Midwest)
        - Ferratin very low
        - Iron toward lower end of normal range
        - Transferrin Saturation level low
        - Hemoglobin low, but not too far from normal range
        - RBC low, but not too far from normal range
        - Lymphocytes are slightly high (one percent over the normal percentage range given by lab)
        - Eosinophils slightly high (one percent over the normal percentage range given by lab)

We follow up with our regular ped in two weeks and the psych has suggested we have labs redrawn to see if they come back abnormal again. I feel like there's a diagnosis that we're missing (even though it might not tie ALL issues together).  What other tests or referrals should I ask for? I am thinking Vitamin B levels and all immunoglobulins. Anything else?

OR ... Am I just a crazy mom, he's probably just anemic, and I'm trying to hard to make connections to other things in his med history?",6,11,2020-01-30,premature birth
AskDocs,I am worried,"A virus has been making its way around my work and home that I assume is some (super-) strain of flu.


My own symptoms began as watery eyes, runny nose, fatigue. Then came waking up with a truly, all consuming, awful headache which I could not properly think and function with until taking a double dose of ibuprofen, along with a scratchy throat and cough that hade me needing a breathing treatment (diagnosed asthmatic at 5 yo; use albuterol; it happened the last 3 days as soon as I woke up- those days, no more tightness or wheezing for the rest of the day).


Today started off the same, but went on to get worse every hour. At this point, I feel like I have been hit by a train, my headache won't go away with meds, exhausted, swollen and painful throat and lymphnodes, fever of 103.6, eyes watery and burning, sinus congestion, chest pain, my head feels like a balloon detached from my body with tingling and random instances of spinning (like when you're extremely drunk), blackness creeps into my vision, my ears suddenly feel as if they're underwater, cough, sweating and chills, difficulty thinking and somewhat impaired motor skills, horrible nausea, vomiting every sip of liquid I try to take in.


From what I remember, and just my own personal ""knowledge"", most of that is typical flu and likely some dehydration. - BUT- I have this tingling and numbness in my arms, hands, legs, and feet. The sensation comes and goes like waves crashing, though since a couple of hours ago, coldness/tingling/numbness is constant in my fingers and part of the underside of my forearm. It is definitely in both hands, but stronger on the right side.


I have asthma, like I said; severe seasonal (something diff in every season); every few months I end up spending a couple of weeks in the hospital having to be given breathing treatments every 1-2 hours (sometimes more), antibiotics, and steroids--it happens 2-3 times a year, always starts off as a cold and quickly becomes bronchitis or pneumonia, treatment is the same every single time; o2 usually hovers around low 50s to mid 60s for a few days (that's *with* treatment).... And I have allergic reactions to penicillin, amoxicillin (sp?), and levoquin (sp?) 


I also have schizoaffective bipolar disorder; OCD; anxiety w/panic attacks; adhd


I have advanced lumbar stenosis and 2 ruptured disc's (also lumbar) ; I had 3 facial reconstructive surgeries (the last one was sometime before 2005); and I have had 3 natural births (second was a complicated pregnancy and complicated birth; third was one month premature); no recent physical trauma/injury


Used heavy drugs (all of them-wasn't picky) from a young age, picked up drinking hardcore in 2012; was physically dependant on opiates, benzos, and alcohol until 2016-ish (went through many cold-turkey withdrawals that were accompanied by seizures and other really great stuff)


Currently, daily, take: zyrtec, geodon, zoloft, suboxone, klonopin, and adderall, *have taken one breathing treatment /day for 3 days in early morning (tbh I just take the treatment until the asthmatic symptoms are gone, then save the rest of the solution for next time. I am running low and it is expensive) - - - have taken ibuprofen once a day for 3 days (mornings)


That is everything that I can think of that anyone might want to know about my health... It has taken most of the evening to be able to complete this post because I just feel like I'm dying...


If you need anymore information, just ask. Idc what people think about me anymore regarding my medical and substance abuse history. It is what it is.



Just for clarification : my biggest worries are the extremity numbness/coldness/tingling, and also just the severity of all of my symptoms. I have extensive experience being sick, and have had the flu before, but this is just really intense and frightening. No one who I know who has been sick with similar symptoms recently has  been affected this severely.... (if you are going to basically tell me I am a crybaby or just not able to handle the same severity of symptoms as most other people, just save it. I am a pro at powering through and this is not typical + I have a few things going on, like the spinning head and blackness in my vision and the numb/cold/tingle extrems, that no one else I know has had).

I was told by two different doctors in my youth (once at ~10 and once at ~18) that I do not have Marfan's. They had me do the wrist and thumb tests, but nothing more.

My PVCs started in 2018. I had an echocardiogram done when getting my PVCs investigated (in 2018). They said my valves and etc were all looking normal.

However, I keep hearing about these ""signs"" that I posted photos of, and wonder if I really *do* have it.

I am: slim built, long-fingered, long-faced, long-everything'd, high palate, combined scoliosis.

But I also have: high foot arches (not flat), not flexible in my legs (can't touch my toes), not *too* bad eyesight (I don't need my glasses when reading or at the computer, half my family has much worse).

Speaking of family: My dad's side is ALL extremely tall and lanky. My female cousin has Ehlers-Danlos. My dad has detached both his retinas and has ""a big heart"" and a murmur- but he is not diagnosed with anything (he avoids doctors).

I wouldn't be worried about it except for the whole ""your heart could literally explode at any minute"" thing.

I'm also looking to have kids in the near future, so I am also concerned that if it goes undetected, it could end badly there.

So, what do you think, docs? Should I ask my new PCP to look more seriously at it, or am I just lanky?",1,4,2020-04-08,premature birth

I would like to preface my questions by stating that I am intending to get a second opinion but currently am waiting for some of this covid mess to clear up. Also, I am a family nurse practitioner but this is my own health and not my area so I would really value some objective feedback.

36f, g1p1L1. 

Premature rupture of membranes, GBS positive, midwife directed augmentation attempts X11 hours failed to start labor, transfer to hospital. Pitocin overnight by 8 am (\~24 hours PROM) had not had a break from the contractions in over 1.5 hours was trying not to cry. Intrauterine pressure monitor inserted - determined that uterus was not relaxing between contractions. Got epidural and they dialed back the pitocin a lot. Rested a few hours - complete, complete by early afternoon. Attempted to labor down the rest of the day. pushed 1.5 hours, rested 1 hour pushed almost 2 hours. Foreceps attempt - unable to get one of the paddles in between the baby and my pelvis Agonizing experience even with the epidural. All this an he only got down to +1 station. 

C-section key statements from report paraphrased:

low transverse - midline extension and far lateral extension to ""within millimeters of right uterine artery."" No imbricating layer (not exactly sure what that means but she told me she could only do 1 layer of sutures). Hemostasis eventually achieved (900 ml loss). 

What I want to know:

How common is it to need to do both a T and a J incision in the same uterus/delivery? 

Was it because the PROM with OP positioning?

How common is it to have only 1 layer of suture?

How safe is it for me to try to have any more babies?

	Are these studies enough to merit having an ultrasound to monitor wound healing?

AskDocs,Might neurological effects of hormones be heritable?,"Background:

My mom (65F) has had migraines with auras since puberty.  I don't know her medication history.  I (38F) began getting migraines in my early 20s with auras a few years after starting the pill. I'm wondering the likelihood estrogen will be an issue for my child.

I recall taking orthotricyclen and mircette in 2000-2005 before starting nortrel around 2006. While on nortrel, I had weird neurological symptoms including feeling like gravity was too strong -- I fell in an elevator when it went up and it was really hard to go up stairs. Switching to taking it at night helped, but I eventually stopped it entirely to conceive. I had two children - 2007 and 2010, but can't recall what I used for birth control between them. My second delivery included tubal ligation, but I used nuvaring to even my moods until about 2012 or 13. 

Not including pregnancy, I averaged one ""migraine"" with auras per year. I believe they began while taking nortrel, but they were mild at first - only auras, then a nap. Then I began having a ""bruised"" feeling after the nap. But each was worse than the last and they were severe by 2012. That's when a friend mentioned that if I get auras, I shouldn't be taking hormonal b.c.  My ob/gyn was horrified that I hadn't mentioned my migraines and discontinued the hormones immediately.  I haven't had any auras or light-sensitive headaches similar to the migraines since then. PMDD has been terrible, but I'm given to understand the risk of stroke isn't worth benefits to mood. (I'm already on an SNRI.)

Now my child (12, assigned male at birth) has come out as transgender. Personality-wise, this kid is my mini-me. We've always been on the same wavelength. We are similarly neurodiverse in that we're both aspie (child has formal autism dx, but I do not.) 

Should I fear estrogen for my child, when ready? I worry that the hormone replacement therapy necessary to transitioning medically will lead to debilitating or risky neurological effects. But I don't know differences in dosages, etc. Or how heritable this sort of thing is.  High blood pressure runs on both sides of the family, as well.",1,1,2020-02-16,early delivery

First, I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses, and medical staff during this global crisis. You are the true warriors in this earthly fight. And I am constantly praying on your behalf. 


I am the mother of a 3 year old with spastic quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy and periventricular leukomalacia. My son has multiple chronic medical conditions such as chronic lung disease, neurological disorders, developmental delay, high aspiration risk, airway clearance impairment, etc. He was born at 24 weeks and was on ventilation for nearly three months in the NICU where we stayed for 151 days. To top it off, I have a history of pulmonary embolism and hypertension. 


I am trying my best to figure out how to help myself and my loved ones. I could not convince my boyfriend to stay home from work so he started staying at his parents house (staying 6ft away from them at all times if and when the rare times he does see them as they are at higher risk too) but now I am fearful of lockdowns and being separated from him during this madness, apart from that, the longer he stays there the more risk he has of infecting his elderly dad. So I am trying to protect both my son and his father. 

Thus, I‚Äôve blocked off a room in my home to quarantine him and observe his symptoms if any at all. (He has decided to stop going to work finally) But how long should he wait to come out of quarantine ? I can‚Äôt live with myself knowing I did not do all that I possibly could to protect my baby.

(Copied from r/epilepsy as I didn‚Äôt know this was a sub that existed at the time)

Hello, I hope this is ok to post, I‚Äôm just looking for a bit of advice. 

My son is 18 months old [1M] and I have noticed he has been doing some things that I‚Äôve found slightly concerning. Namely, he will randomly roll his eyes upwards and (sometimes, not every time) shake his head or similar movements. It only lasts a second or a few at most. He also ‚Äúspaces out‚Äù sometimes but I never really paid much attention to it until recently so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just normal toddler behaviour or if it‚Äôs something else/excessive.

My partner thinks I‚Äôm over reacting, and says that it‚Äôs just him being ‚Äúnutty‚Äù - admittedly he is a ball of energy so I wouldn‚Äôt be completely surprised if it was just a quirk, but something in me is telling me it‚Äôs not just that. He was also born 2 months premature at 32 weeks, had a 3 week NICU stay but touch wood, no lasting effects (he‚Äôs been walking for months, babbles and says a few words, is very aware and I have no reason to be concerned about any of his development) so I m not sure if that makes a difference, like the possibility of it being more common in premature children? 

Anyone who can give a bit of insight would be thoroughly appreciated. Please feel free to tell me if I‚Äôm being just a paranoid mother, and in the same breath please don‚Äôt refrain from being blunt if you think it‚Äôs a cause for concern.

AskDocs,Muscle weakness and stiffness; physio or personal trainer?,"Female, caucasian, 5'8"", 145 lbs, 49 years

I have lingering weakness possibly from being in the ICU 5 years ago, what should I do?

Before the ICU stay, I was finding it difficult to stand for a long time, I guess starting when I was 42-43ish. If I did, I found that I got stiff. Often, I would wake up in the morning, stiff. So I started doing stretches at work when I had a bit of a break, because I sit a lot at work.

So I had a baby 5 years ago, I had acute fatty liver of pregnancy, so I had liver failure causing them to deliver him at 36 weeks. After a rough first day in the NICU he is doing great. I had a lot of blood loss and they debated doing a liver transplant. I was in ICU for 3 days and another 10 days in the maternity unit while they waited for my liver to go to an acceptable level.

So from when I recovered, and was back at home, I found that it was difficult for me to go from sitting on the floor, to standing up.

I got a frozen shoulder when my baby was an infant, and did a lot of physio for that and it's okay now. I still do my arm physio exercises most days, and I also do ballet-style stretches with my legs. I asked my physio person about my back stiffness and those exercises I do not do regularly - lie on my back, bend my knees and tilt my legs to one side then the other. I get about 6000 steps in, in an average day, of getting to and from work and walking on my break.

Five years on, I still find it difficult to go from sitting on the floor to standing. I find it difficult to lean forward washing dishes at the sink, doing other things that involve bending to pick things off the floor etc. These things make me tired and achy. I was trying to listen to my body and rest and wait and kind of make my energy last longer. However I am really frustrated because I can't get my stuff done this way. I am not THAT old yet.

My doctor tested me for rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. But now she is suggesting that I take an SSRI. I disagree with this. I am depressed to a certain degree but I am able to manage my depression after all these years. I think I need a way to get stronger, or rule out other medical conditions. She thinks I need to do aerobic exercise. She is probably right but I have no energy to do this. I have a low thyroid and she does not want to discuss adjusting my medication for that, she won't tell me my levels when I ask. I don't know if that is pertinent. She tests my liver levels every year or so but I don't know what they are.

I think I need either a personal trainer, or a physiotherapist, to help me get stronger, but I don't know which one.

I need more detailed instruction than ""get aerobic exercise"" I know nothing about working out. Maybe I need to eat more protein. I don't want to hurt myself if I pick the wrong physical exercise professional. If I get a personal trainer, will they know if they are in over their head with me? What do you think?

AskDocs,25 year unsolved medical mystery now becoming a terminal illness / killing me,"Hello everyone, 25 year old male, 130lbs, 5'10"" tall, on medications: Dexamethasone, Toradol, generic anti-histamines, corticosteroid puffer, sometimes antibiotics. Family history of: heart disease, kidney disease, various cancers (prostate, thyroid, pancreatic), autoimmune & heamatological disease (Lupus, Thalassemia, Ulcerative colitis, autoimmume thyroid disease, diabetes, Psoriasis)

After visiting countless doctors and emergency rooms/hospitals, I am coming here out of desparation after the best doctor in Ontario admitted that my case has him stumped. I am deteriorating faster than ever and I know I do not have much longer to live

Symptoms =

-- Unexplained & recurring fevers, with meningitis type symptoms of stiff & painful neck, base of skull pain, photophobia as well as sudden swelling of eyes with a lot of puss-like crust that seals them shut, swelling of wrist, ankles, feet, throat, uvula, ears, sometimes other tissues / organs as well, and a general feeling of being deathly ill. These ""attacks"" / ""episodes"" last anywhere from 2 days to 4 or 5 weeks. 

-- Localized hives with redness around them, these hives have an itchy burn to them and either pop up at random, or after exposure to sunlight, artificial lights, or water. Can happen anywhere on the body but a small circular area. I chalked this up to ""allergies"" for years but lately Ive noticed it doesn't matter what season it is & eliminating food that could cause allergies has been completely ineffective. Interestingly the association between water & this symptom has always been evident

-- Widespread area mainly top of hands up to eblows where all of the skin develops a bright red tone, becomes itchy, and feels like a 2nd degree burn. Wrapping with cold clothes and other physical traditional burn treatments helps

-- large red area, with angry red circle in center, with a whitehead. Usually these are small but sometimes they swell up massively & prevent sitting or laying down properly. They appear to be infections but antibiotics does nothing whereas corticosteroids & toradol help (both for this and many other symptoms this holds true)

Actual infections: 1. Gangrene of toe / foot (that needed lancing and draining but started going septic despite that treatment) 2. Respiratory, bronch/strep at the same time 2 years in a row confirmed by culture 3. Skin / muscle, these are rare compared to the phenomena that are clearly not infections due to their response to medication, but when it happens it is usually more severe and immediate responds to antibiotics so its obvious

-- Extremely fast / thick skin growth on bottom lip & bottoms of feet, both left and right. Hands used to be unaffected. The thick skins color is very yellow on the soles of feet but not the other areas which has led to less worry about my liver than I think is necessary (Jaundice of mucus membranes / general skin jaundice has been noted in my ER records). The thick skin is very painful and causes the healthy skin around it to split and tear open from pressure, causing bleeding and dramatically increasing the local risk of infection. Worst area is the feet. A 2 or 3 inch thick layer of skin grows even when I am off my feet which is almost always now. Doctor thought it was classic callous when I was more active, but ended up classifying it as Hyperkeratosis once it became apparent that activity or pressure wasn't the cause. If the skin is cut off or treated in any way it comes back more aggresively, growing quicker than before and expands further. If it is not treated, it grows at a fast rate still but causes the skin around it to split open from the tightness etc. Very frustrating and debilitating. No treatments or remedies have prevented it from reoccuring or reduced the severity

-- Hundreds of scars / stretch mark looking things primarily around my buttocks and thighs and knees, these are unexplained by growth, weight gain/loss or any other common cause

-- Spontaneous bleeding, coughing up large amounts of blood, bright red poo, and one time where I woke up feeling deathly ill and nauseated & threw up a nice brownish redish coffee ground style sludge... And a lot of it

-- Bright purple/pinkish urine, or dark brown/black urine that is always abnormally foamy and has a white subatance settle at the bottom

-- Thick, almost jello consistency / rubbery consistency phlegm. When I cough up stuff I could literally chew it if I wanted like a piece of meat or gum or roll it into a ball in my fingers. The mucous/phlegm is usually yellow, brown or blackish 

-- Shortness of breath

-- Heart racing, gets worse with even mild excersize, and episodes of fainting due to standing or switching position too quickly

-- Hearing imparment from very young/birth in left ear & total inability to smell

-- Vision loss getting progressively worse

-- Metallic taste in mouth

-- Massive & excruciatingly painful hematomas / fluid under skin even after very minor injuries

-- Superhuman metabolic rate... Always been very thin really, despite for years now I have eatten almost 10000 calories a day. That's right... Not 1000... ten thousand calories a day! Definitely over 5 thousand, and I have never been able to gain weight except one short period of my life and I could not identify why I was able to put on weight at that time. In recent months I have given up my extreme eating habit as it seems to have no effect on my nutrition or ability to be healthy, amd probably consume from 2000 to 4000 cal a day and have plateaued where I do not gain weight but am also not losing weight anymore

-- Dental problems, early extractions etc despite being born with ""perfect teeth"" and taking care of them

-- Flank pain made worse by eating, made better after pooing

-- Sparse, thick, coarse hair everywhere except head, pubic area. Those 2 areas have more normal feeling hair and its denser there. Hair grows slowly everywhere except those 2 areas. If you shave my leg it will grow back over months but if you shave my head I'll have a full head of hair in a few weeks. 

-- Brittle, fast growing nails & deformed baby toenail on each foot (mother has the same issue with baby toes on each of her feet)

-- Chest pain, back pain, bone pain, muscle pain

-- Muscle spasms so severe they cause my fingers / toes to twist all weird and lock themselves up. Think of the foot cramp after swimming but your entire leg, arm, hand or foot & it happens at random when you move or use a muscle or muscle group

-- Sudden, temporary lower limb paralysis documented at least 4 times by my medical records

-- Sensitive to cold

-- Nose bleeds

-- Drenching night sweats

Nervous system / pain receptor defect... A wound on finger causes pain in ribs, back or leg for example. Especially when the wound is touched while healing. Another example is; wound on my leg will hurt and cause the same pain happening in that area, but in my abdominal area, or arms as well 

-- Easy bruising, bone breaks, slow healing 

-- Ridiculous / out of proportion strength or ability to harness adrenaline? At my sickest point in recent times I was still able to lift a 350 to 450 pound object up multiple flights of stairs, being the only person on one side and the other side needing 3 or 4 men much larger than myself and they could hardly do it. This isn't the only example of my strength being out of proportion to what I SHOULD be capable of especially given my physical condition, but it is the most obvious example

And many many more physical issues. Those above are the most serious / worrisome though.

She will go an entire day on 3 chicken nuggets. Before you say this is a picky eater you can offer her ANYTHING she wants for breakfast lunch or dinner she does not want to eat.

AskDocs,Pregnancy and fetal development risks relating to obesity vs overall age of prospective mother?,"I hope this is the right place for my question/quandary.

My wife (29f) and I (33m) are preparing to start reproducing in the very near future.  Like many persons in the developed world, we both spent a long time developing our personal and professional lives, at the sacrifice of intentionality delaying our plans to reproduce.  Like many in similar situations, she is now starting to feel ""under the gun"" to get the baby making done sooner than later.

I want to provide the best possible life my offspring, and we are prepared in many ways to enable this, however one lingering concern remains for me: my wife's current physical condition is not exactly what one would describe as ""fit"".  Reading scholarly articles [like this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983896/) has made me particularly concerned about the potential life long neurological and metabolic effects on a prospective child.

I am also aware of the widely known fetal development risks related to maternal age.  Therein is the quandary.  Do we push to make babes as soon as possible to preempt any age related difficulties, or do we focus on her fitness until she's no longer obese or overweight before conceiving?

I understand that this can be an especially sensitive topic for many, so I will reiterate for absolute clarity: my sole concern in this line of inquiry is to ensure the best possible long term health and quality of life outcome for any prospective future children.


**TL;DR**

33m and 29f planning for near future conception;  29f is currently overweight or obese, but urgently wants to ""beat the clock"" on age related pregnancy complications, while 33m is hesitant due to evidence-backed concerns about potential fetal development issues and lifelong negative health outcomes for offspring due to maternal obesity during gestation.

During this course, his cough started to change and he started struggling to breathe and would vomit constantly due to the coughing. I brought him into the hospital as he was using his accessory muscles to breathe. Doctor told me in ER that he was using his accessory muscles but it was because his nose was congested, so recommended saline and nose frida. My husband and I did that, but our son continued to worsen with his cough. He would have huge coughing fits that would cause him to struggle to breathe. My last straw was when I was home with him and his lips started going blue because he was choking. I flipped him over on his stomach and started hitting his back and he puked up a lot of mucus. I rushed him to the hospital. They swabbed him for RSV, Influenza and Pertussis. Paediatrician started him on an antibiotic while we wait for the the pertussis results. He is admitted to hospital, with low fever, high heart rate and low sp02. He requires sp02 when sleeping but never when awake. We stay 3 days and then the last day he was napping on his own without requiring oxygen. My husband and I have an owlet that monitors heart rate and oxygen. We hadn't used it before but thought this would be good. The nurse told me if he fell lower than 90 to bring him in immediately as once they fall, they can really fall. No alarms go off in the night, baby is sleeping in our room. A few coughing fits but nothing bad. I look at the results over night. His average sp02 was 92.

AskDocs,Wife becomes pregnant after having bother ovaries removed.,"27F, 165 lbs, 5'4"", no medications

My wife had a small (golf ball) ovarian cyst and one of her ovaries removed at 18 after it burst causing extreme pain and other complications.

 She had our daughter at 24 with a uneventful pregnancy, but ended up having a C section because labor would not progress. 

After the birth she believed she felt a hernia in her abdomen, and had a CT scan done to verify that was the case. They determined there was a hernia present, but another large cyst was discovered on the remaining ovary. We researched fertility preservation options over a year period and ended up deciding against all of it. She had her remaining ovary removed about a year after the cyst was discovered, that made her infertile around 26. Sad situation for our whole family at the time


Now my wife is about to turn 28  and a while back she had been feeling sick for a few weeks and decided to take a pregnancy test to get it out of her mind. Shes 22 weeks along and we are all (including the doctor that delivered our daughter and removed the remaining ovary) completely mystified. Nobody understands how my wife could be pregnant. I still have trouble grasping the idea myself.

The only explanation the OB could give is that either he or the doctor that removed the first ovary (different Doc) left a small piece of ovary behind unintentionally. 

We have been dating since she was sixteen and I was there for both surgeries. I heard both docs say that they were unable to save either Ovary. 

Has anyone ever heard of this? Is there any other possible explanation? Should my wife resume hormone replacement after the birth and possible breastfeeding period? She was on hormones before because she was considered to be menopausal. Thanks in advance!

I appreciate the support so much because after going to many doctors it was starting to feel like I was on my own here. Thank you thank you thank you!

Posting here because at this point I‚Äôll literally try anything for help. 
Before I get into the details, I will say I have been prone to yeast infections since I was about 15yo but never had a bacterial infection. 
Back in July 2019 I had what I thought was a yeast infection and I was putting off going to get the medicine because it wasnt THAT irritating at this point. One morning I woke up and had horrible irritation and pain down there and was running about a 101 degree fever. My mom took me to a friend of hers who is a doctor because I was able to get in right away. They swabbed me and prescribed me Clyndomiazin (spelling is off I‚Äôm sure) I finished it and was all back to normal in a week or so, but then in mid August the symptoms were back. It was a Saturday so I went to urgent care and told them everything that had happened and they gave me a shot of clyndomiazin and prescribed me antibiotics by mouth. I finished those and was still feeling discomfort so I booked with an OBGYN and he swabbed me and looked at the cells under a microscope and told me I didn‚Äôt have enough good bacteria from taking all the medicine and that‚Äôs why I still had irritation because I had essentially burned all the protective layers of my vaginal walls off and everything was exposed nerve endings. He prescribed me a steroid to insert every night for 5 nights, after that I felt fine! 
Then in October 2019 I started dating my current boyfriend. We had sex and the next day I was showing signs of a yeast/bacterial infection, I went to the doctor and the swabbed me and yep had one so I was prescribed flagul orally. Then had sex again with my boyfriend and it happened again, so I brought it up to him because now I was worried about STDs. We were both tested, we‚Äôre both clean. But the doctor explained to me that it is possible our individual flora don‚Äôt match up well and that‚Äôs why I am getting these infections. So him and I abstain from sex for a good few months because I keep getting these reoccurring infections and absolutely no relief. Seeing doctor after doctor because no one really is listening to be or taking it seriously. I finally seem to get it under control in late December early January. THEN in February I am having symptoms again, but have not had sex with my boyfriend so I know it‚Äôs not just being caused by him at this point. I book an appointment with a doctor who is a woman because at this point I was only able to get in with male OBGYN at the clinic I was going to and was not feeling heard. So I go see my doctor and she listens to everything I say, swabs me and sees that my cervix is inflamed so she asked if I‚Äôve been tested for HPV, I wasn‚Äôt sure because that wasn‚Äôt on the paper when I was STD tested back in like November. She performed a pap too. 
Swab comes back positive for bacteria, pap is normal. She prescribes me flagul orally. I take it, things go back to normal. I finally feel safe enough to have sex with my boyfriend again. We did, everything was fine for like 2 weeks and I‚Äôm STOKED. Then I wake up one morning with that irritation and at this point I know what‚Äôs going on because I‚Äôve been dealing with this since July 2019. 
I get in with my doctor. She swabs just to be safe but prescribes me flagul vaginal inserts which I had not done. She said instead of doing it 5 nights in a row, do it twice a week for a month. Also, swab came back positive for bacteria.
I‚Äôve now finished my 3rd week of inserts and am waiting to do my fourth after my cycle is over. Around week 2 of inserts I noticed white chunks of discharge coming out, slight odor but only if I got close to it. It wasn‚Äôt like I could smell it just laying down or anything. I had never had this type of discharge since this all started happening. And I know it‚Äôs not the medicine coming out because that is a clear gel and this has the consistency of a small cheese curd (gross I know but best comparison). The irritation has not stopped and sometimes feels even worse. I have an appointment to see her this coming Wednesday, but I just thought I‚Äôd come here to see if anyone out there has ever seen this before. It is really starting to affect my mental health and everyday life because I‚Äôm constantly feeling dirty and uncomfortable, plus it is affecting my sex life. My boyfriend is understanding and supportive but it‚Äôs rough for me especially since this is a new relationship. 
I occasionally drink but have almost come to a complete stop because I know that promotes the bad bacteria, I do not smoke cigarettes and have been clean from weed for 40 days (trying to find a new job).
I have started taking probiotic pills over the last 2 months, I try my best to eat a yogurt every morning and I have at least 1 kombucha a day since the beginning of the year. All to promote the good bacteria. 
I am prescribed 20 mg of Vibryd an SSRI, 60 mg of Dexilant and I take birth control, same one since I was 16 years old. 
I have not changed any laundry soaps, I use Cetaphil to clean that area, only wear cotton undies and don‚Äôt wear any at night when I sleep, do not use douching methods or any vaginal cleansing wipes. I occasionally use baby wipes but they have no scent and the ingredients are safe. 
If anyone out there has anything helpful, I‚Äôd love to hear it. Thanks everyone!",363,164,2020-03-08,week of birth
AskDocs,"Physicians are stumped about my swollen, red foot. They have ruled out infection, lymphedema, and rheumatoid arthritis. Any other ideas what could be causing swelling and redness in one foot?","34f, 5‚Äô11‚Äù 140lbs, Caucasian. No history of disease. Only medication is birth control pills.

My [LEFT FOOT](https://imgur.com/a/WZIwNir) in the upper foot area around the toes has been mildly swollen which increases to moderate swelling and redness in the evenings, for a few months. Blisters recently appeared on three of my left toes caused by the swelling which promoted me to visit my physician. I am experiencing no pain associated with the swelling and redness, just some mild to moderate tightness. Elevation of the foot helps relieve some of the swelling but it doesn‚Äôt appear to go away completely. The redness is particularly bad after I get out of the shower in the evenings.

On this same foot I have had ongoing toenail bed injuries on my big toe including an ingrown toe nail 6 years ago and repeated blood blisters under the nail bed from hiking over the years (which has caused my toenail to grow thickened and easily reinjured), the most recent injury was maybe 6 months ago. 

I mentioned the toenail injures to my physician so she assumed an cellulitis infection due to the redness and swelling. I was placed on 825mg Augmentin 2x a day for 7 days. No improvement was seen after the course of antibiotics. An ultrasound was performed on my entire leg to check for veinous issues and blood clots. The results were normal. They then completed various blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis, that also came back normal. I mentioned the possibility of lymphedema but that was dismissed as the doctor mentioned I didn‚Äôt show any swelling elsewhere in my lymph nodes and that I likely did not have any underlying condition to cause it. The physician(s) are stumped and have referred me to a podiatrist who I am seeing next week. 

Does anyone have any other ideas what may be causing potential chronic redness and inflammation in one foot that is worse in the evenings and tolerable during day time? 

I am concerned it could be related to some underlying disease or something.

UPDATE: thank you all very much for your comments. It helps to re-confirm that I need to push my physician on this and get to the bottom of what is going on. 

To answer a few questions that were asked, the DVT test (ultrasound) was normal. They did the entire leg and groin area. Although they did not scan my foot, can you get a clot in your foot? The doc and ultrasound tech seemed very unconcerned about DVT since my swelling and redness in my foot is not constant and I have no pain, there is no swelling or redness elsewhere in my leg or groin. I will keep this in mind though and ask again about DVT. 

I have not been bitten by a tick, so I am not sure about Lyme disease. Can you get Lyme disease other ways? 

I have had no injuries in my leg or foot area except the injuries to my toenail bed. That is why my big toenail is yellow and deformed looking. 

I have been on birth control pills since I was 18. Although I did recently change prescriptions because I was having issues with my mensuration (extra pain, bleeding, nausea that was not normal for me) and started my new prescription (generic for Seasonale) in June 2019. I will ask my doctor if there could be a connection.

I have attached a couple extra photos to the images of my foot, one is my foot this morning after I was walking around. As you can see the redness and swelling has gone down considerably. My foot looks like this most of the day, but then turns red and swollen at night. The other photo is the bottom of my foot, since someone asked for that angle.

Thanks all for your help!

UPDATE 2/5/20/: My physician thinks I could have Erythromelalgia. She ordered a CBC diff blood test and results were all normal. I saw a podiatrist as well and he was stumped, he did rule out fungal infection. My concern is how do you for sure test for Erythromelalgia? It seems like some of my symptoms are similar, redness and swelling mostly at night and hot, itchy, skin after showers that are alleviated with cool water or ice. Some symptoms that are not similar are constant swelling. My left foot is constantly mildly swollen, not just at night. Also, I am not experiencing any pain which seems to be common with that disease. Is there any other tests I should request from my doctor or a type of specialist I should see to rule out other things?

UPDATE 4/8/20: I spoke with my PCP again she referred me to a vascular surgeon. I have now been to a vascular surgeon and had a Reflux ultrasound done. Results were normal. The ultrasound tech said she didn‚Äôt see any edema in my foot even though I could feel my foot slightly swollen. The vascular surgeon wasn‚Äôt totally sure what is going on but it doesn‚Äôt appear to be veinous. He mentioned vasospams and Raynauds in passing but ultimately referred me to an Orthopedic surgeon. I had that visit recently with the ortho, had an X-ray of my foot completed. Normal. Ortho noticed an area of swelling was just below my lateral three toes and gave me a steroid shot thinking it could be arterial swelling. He also ordered an arterial study to be done. He kept saying he isn‚Äôt getting a good pulse in my foot and my foot was very cold. He also mentioned Raynauds as a possibility. My next appointment is to get the arterial study done.

Update 6/13/20: the steroid shot did not help the swelling. The artery ultrasound was normal. The ortho has now ordered an MRI with contrast to be done. When he was pressing with moderate to heavy pressure on the are of swelling, just under my third and 4th toe there was quite a bit of pain. I hadn‚Äôt noticed any pain previously although I don‚Äôt think I have ever squeezed that area if my foot to check. After walks I sometimes feel pain like swelling tightness, but not throbbing or shooting pain like I felt when he was placing pressure on the swollen area. No where else in the foot. He didn‚Äôt outright mention tumor but I think he was hinting at the possibility. I started researching tissue and bone sarcomas. They are extremely rare and even more rare in the foot, but my symptoms especially for osteosarcoma seem to fit (swelling at tumor location, redness, hot to touch, symptoms worse at night, comes and goes). Although the ortho did not mention if he saw any tumors on the x-ray. I am assuming if it was an osteosarcoma it would show up on X-ray. Anyways, just waiting on my insurance to approve MRI. Here‚Äôs hoping it‚Äôs not cancer!

Update 11/14/20: I have a lot of tests done since my last update. The MRI showed my foot has bone marrow edema, mostly in the toes and joint effusion in the metatarsal toe joints. No mass or neuroma detected. The radiologist suggested possible severe Raynauds. So the vascular surgeon referred me to a vascular doctor. The vascular doctor said definitely not Raynauds based on my symptoms. He was thinking either an auto immune disease or marrow edema syndrome. He ordered a ton of lab work for various auto immune disease, also gout, vitamin D level; all came back normal. He ordered a second MRI to check on the bone marrow edema, since it had been several months. The MRI was stable and my condition remains the same. He prescribed arthritic aspirin 325mg to see if that helped my symptoms. It maybe helped a little but was not effective overall. We discussed Erythromelalgia as a possibility, so he referred me to a neurologist for further diagnosis. The neurologist didn‚Äôt think it was EM and instead believes it to be complex regional pain syndrome. He wants to rule out other diseases first, so he has ordered additional blood work including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and heavy metal poisoning. He also ordered a EMG and nerve conduction test. Both tests were normal and my nerves are all fine. Waiting to get bloodwork soon. He wrote me a prescription for Gabapentin (300mg twice a day) to see if that helps with my symptoms. The side effects have been a little rough for me so far, but I actually think it is helping with the burning sensation at least. My foot still gets read and is always slightly swollen, but I have noticed i am not feeling the hot itchy burn since I have been on gabapentin. It‚Äôs only been one week though.

AskDocs,"24F, feeling very sick after accidentally inhaling a lot of fumes from rotten potatoes. Could I have solanine poisoning?","24F, 5‚Äô6, 111 pounds, Caucasian, never smoked, almost never drink, no recreational drugs, located in Charleston, SC. History of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type III along with a number of comorbidities, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal issues. More details on medical history at end of post.

There has been a smell coming from my pantry for the last several days that I haven‚Äôt been able to identify. Today, I opened the door and just got hit with this wall of fumes, and I decided enough was enough. I spent about half an hour tearing it apart and smelling every single thing in it. By the time I identified the potatoes and threw them out, I was feeling pretty terrible. My head kills, I‚Äôm super nauseous, and I‚Äôm having chest pains.

I looked it up online and read that rotten potato fumes can be extremely toxic, but it‚Äôs hard to tell if I‚Äôm feeling awful because of toxins or because the smell and activity triggered flares of my pre-existing conditions (see below). It‚Äôs not uncommon for me to experience chest pains just from walking around the kitchen for a while, and I have a headache and nausea for the better part of most days as it is. It feels worse than normal, but not so much worse that it couldn‚Äôt be a heightened version of the regular stuff.

That being said, I have been experiencing some other unexplained symptoms over the last few weeks that I wonder might have been caused by inhaling the fumes before they were as noticeable. I‚Äôve been experiencing random spikes in temperature (99.6-100) that last for about 12-18 hours, go away, and then pop back up again a few days later. I‚Äôve also lost weight (from 122 to 111 in less than a month) with no changes in diet, and I‚Äôve had pretty bad diarrhea and abdominal pain too (mostly upper right, but it kinda moves around). I‚Äôve also had really bad dry eyes and dry mouth. (My rheumatologist has suspected Sjogren‚Äôs for a while and ordered a lip biopsy recently, so that‚Äôs happening soon.) I also have had a sore throat (kinda burns, probably related to dry mouth) and swollen glands.

I have an unrelated diagnostic laparoscopy scheduled for next month, and they‚Äôre going to test me for covid before that. I don‚Äôt think I have covid, and neither does my doctor. Mostly because the fever has been so off-and-on, and I‚Äôve had no cough at all. But I‚Äôll be tested in the next few weeks regardless.

I just don‚Äôt know how to tell whether the worsened symptoms I‚Äôm experiencing should be worrying me or not. I sent a message to my doctor, but the office doesn‚Äôt open for several hours, and she probably won‚Äôt see my message until the end of the work day anyway (that‚Äôs the time of day she usually sends me messages). If there‚Äôs a chance I‚Äôm experiencing poisoning, what steps should I take to manage it until I hear from my doctor?

Health issues: EDS (type III), POTS, mitral valve prolapse, MCAS, pernicious anemia, gastroparesis, IBD, GERD, interstitial cystitis, idiopathic hypersomnolence, small fiber neuropathy, cervical instability, scoliosis, kyphosis, tortuous colon, vestibular adenitis (two past surgeries for this), and unexplained eosinophilia (pending hematology referral). Suspected esophageal dysmotility (doctor wanted to do a manometry, but I declined because it sounds awful, so this is unconfirmed). Suspected endometriosis (pending laparoscopy). Suspected Sjogren‚Äôs (pending lip biopsy).

I have had no recent changes in meds apart from my cardiologist upping my metoprolol from 50 to 75 mg/day because I‚Äôve been dealing with shortness of breath, presyncope, and chest pains more often than normal lately due to inactivity (thanks, quarantine).

AskDocs,"17F MEDICAL MYSTERY: 9 symptom groups, 5 doctors, 3 specialists, 0 answers.","Hello you wonderful people of reddit.

Mandatory warning, English is not my first language and I have a lot of different symptoms that have been going on for different amounts of time, so I'm sorry if the post gets messy. I've been writing this for almost 5 hours now, so I might also be going slightly insane.

&#x200B;

Before you run away from this huge wall of text, please listen to me for a few minutes. Okay? Okay. I'm a desperate young girl who loved playing the piano, drawing and playing video games, and now can do none of those due to nerve damage and joint pain that can't be explained, among other weird and possibly connected symptoms. I know this has a lot of information, and I am not asking you to read all of it. I'm asking you to look through the bold titles and see if one of them sounds like something you would know a thing or two about.

So yeah, possible problems for you to solve include

* Why am I semi immune to sedatives, caffeine and alcohol
* Why is there something wrong with every limb of me
* Is there an autoimmune disease that could be causing all of this

The reason I included all of this: every time I go to a doctor, there is something I forget to mention, can't mention because it's not their specialty or am just too embarrased to list all these weird symptoms, but a lot of them have proven to be important.

I will be crossposting this to r/DiagnoseMe and r/medical  so sorry for anyone that has to see it multiple times. After every section with meaningful information I've included a small TLDR just because eeehhhh this is quite a bit of text. If you've read even this far, I am so greatful for you. Thank you.

**INFORMATION ABOUT ME:** I'm a caucasian, 17 year old female from Finland. I am 158 cm/ 5'2"" tall and weigh around 70 kg/154 lb. Financially we are struggling, but we can afford the public healthcare just fine. Rarely drink alcohol, no other usuage of drugs etc. If you asked my doctor about my medical condition, she would take a long pause and then say she doesn't really know the whole picture, but something is definitely wrong.Looking at family background, my mother's side has a lot type 1 diabetes and while I don't know a lot about my father's side, I know all of his siblings and their children have ADHD and asperger's while I seem to have neither. I'm currently on birth control pills and medication for depression, both for 2-3 years.

&#x200B;

**CURRENT SITUATION:** During the past couple of years I've been getting more and more unexplainable symptoms. They are all over the place, concerning at least my nerves and joints, but most likely also my blood, bones, autoimmune system, brain and digestive system. They started getting aggressively worse 7-8 months ago, and ever since that I've had regular visits with my local doctor, regular blood work checkups, an ultrasound, thoracic (lung) radiographies and most recently a few days ago, a bone marrow biopsy. The only real progress we've made is with my bloodwork, constantly showing the same abnormalities specified later.\^ TLDR: Multiple different symptoms have been bothering me for years, getting worse 8 months ago.

&#x200B;

**FINLAND AND DOCTORS:** Finland is a great country to live in, don't get me wrong. I know there are multiple countries and multiple people who have an even worse situation and I'm not trying to say otherwise. However I live in an extremely small town, which has it's good and bad sides. I can get 45 minutes of time from my local doctor almost any day I need it, and all the staff at our local clinic knows my situation and does their best to help me.

It's just that they can't do a lot. Once a month or so they take some blood and every monday it's sent off to the bigger city. My doctor can monitor my symptoms but after that all she can do is send me to another doctor which will take months, and since my symptoms are so episodic, this can turn out to be problematic. Private clinics would have times in weeks if not days, but we can't really afford that.\^ TLDR: Finland is good, just a bit slow.

&#x200B;

**PROBLEMS STARTING IN CHILDHOOD:** I was an extremely clumsy child. Not in a cute way, in a way where I would break all of my teeth and constantly have bruises just from carefully playing. I have never broken a bone or really gotten seriously injured, since I have always been extremely careful to a point where I have missed out on a lot of things because of it. I think it's mostly a mix of me having terrible balance and a lacking depth perception. Also, extremely low pain tolerance.\^ TLDR: Bad balance and depth perception.

&#x200B;

**GROWING UP:** I was a really tall child, having rapid growth burts. This would also cause my spine to go real roller coastery real fast. I had pretty severe scoliosis, and after I turned 9 and moved to a bigger school with actual healthcare they started ping ponging me to the big hospital and back, deciding if something should be done about it or not. When I turned 11, I had a huge growth burst of 8 cm/ 3.1"", and after that, I literally stopped growing. Less than one cm in 6 years after that, sooo my roller coaster spine was left alone and didn't really bother me then. Yeah, now it does.

Then a weird thing. It turned out I was actually missing most of baby or adult teeth, depending on how you look at it I guess. I only shed my upper central incisors, one upper canine and one lower canine. The upper ones grew primary teeth, but it turned out there just wasn't any developement for primary teeth elsewhere in my mouth. While researching the correct terms I figured it's actually not that rare to have this with 1 or 2 teeth, but almost all of them? Yikes. Also, my dentists had never seen it and were extremely confused.\^ TLDR: My spine and teeth hate their lives.

&#x200B;

**MIDPOINT NOTES:** With these more ""normal"" things out of the way, let's dive deeper. Yeah, that's just the beginning.

I had to choose what flair to use, since my problems fall under several of them. This also made me think if I should go through my problem as a timeline or as groups, and ended up with the group approach. I will try to make it clear when everything happened and might end up making an actual timeline drawing at some point, maybe it will help me too.

From this point forward, I have no actual way of telling what is connected and what is just coinsidence.

&#x200B;

**BLOOD WORK:** Let's start with the simple things, my blood work. I now noticed they're not as regularly taken as I remember, but that's fine. There are three main things my doctors are worried about, and that have been kept track of because of that. The problem is, in Finland we have completely different names for them, but I tried my best with google. There's C-reactive protein (P-CRP), Lymphocyte (B-leuk) and thrombocyte (B-Trom). My mother recalls her sister had high thrombocyte levels growing up, but we're not sure. Anyway, I made a fast obnoxiously colored chart with all the ""important"" blood work available [here](https://imgur.com/a/DMqpdKM) as blood work 1 and blood work 2.

&#x200B;

**NERVES:** The first really serious symptom I had was nerve damage. Around the spring of 2017 I started having pain in my left elbow, that radiated through my wrist to my fingers. It got worse on the daily until one day I just woke up with absolutely no feeling on the outer side of my hand. My pinkie was completely numb, ring finger partually. The outer part of my palm under the fingers had reduced feeling. Since this explanation is kind of clumsy, in the previous imgur also available [here](https://imgur.com/a/DMqpdKM) is an image (nerves 1).

When the summer holiday ended, I finally got a doctor's appointment and immediately got sent to a childrens hand and nerve specialist. After about 7 months of living in constant level 4-5 pain, I finally got an appointment with a doctor who could actually help me. She immediately scheluded surgery in January without any diagnosis or further tests. Yes, she said it's most likely nerve compression, but nothing more official.

So the surgery comes and when I wake up, I actually do feel my hand and the constant pain is gone. The surgery was supposed to take about an hour, but ended up taking almost 5 and I never got a proper explanation as of to why, apart from that she had to cut/grind/whet/whatever term is correct for smoothing off a part of my bone. Recovery went fine, but after the pain killers wore off, the pain came back. Now it wasn't constant 4, it was occasional 5 or 6. The hand is still pretty much useless: It has no muscle mass and a lot of everyday tasks hurt, but I'm used to it now. The worst part is, after the surgery if anything touches the spot on my elbow pictured on nerves 2, it's literally the worst pain I can imagine. Sometimes the similar pain happens when I just straighten out the arm. If the bone marrow biopsy was level 7 pain, I would completely honestly say that touching my elbow is worse. I've heard 8 is the pain level of child birth, so I really don't want to go that high, but it feels like it. Reminder, I have very low pain tolerance, and even hugging often hurts.

Unfortunately about 6 months later similar symptoms started in my right arm. Until this day it still hasn't done the complete numbness-trick, but is constantly hurting, has no muscle mass and just kind of hangs around. I've had to take multiple hour long breaks during writing this just because my fingers will stop functioning.

That's another thing. Along with the pain, the nerve damage has caused my fingers to not function too well. I literally can't control my ring finger on it's own, it will just follow my pinky that also is hard to control. Due to the lack of muscle mass, holding things is already difficult, but add on to that 2/5 fingers just doing whatever they please, and it's pretty annoying to be honest.\^ TLDR: My both hands have nerve damage, most likely ulnar nerve compression caused by one bone being too large.

&#x200B;

**BACK AND LUNGS:** The scoliosis has started creeping up on me. To put it lightly, I'm skewed. Lopsided. Crooked. Not straight at all. Funnily enough, you can mostly notice this when I have a ponytail: My head is always so much tilted/skewed to the left that the ponytail is also always hanging on my shoulder. This has led to a situation where my upper neck and lower back are both extremely painful. Compared to the hand pain, it's a different pain. While nerve bain is stabbing and radiating, the back pain is just a constant weight that slowly makes it harder and harder to breathe.

The only thing that doesn't hurt my back is lying down. This might explain some of my extra weight: Even sitting is painful. I work very hard to keep myself out of bed, but for example in school I have to take a a break once every hour to go to the bathroom just to lie on the floor. Unhygienic for sure, but also the greatest relief ever.\^ TLDR: If I sit or stand, by back will start hurting in about 20 minutes so bad I feel like I can't breathe.

&#x200B;

**START OF ""EPISODES""**: About 7 months ago I got a pretty mild case of angina or tonsillitis. Nothing major, got it from my mom who works in a daycare, went with her to get antibiotics from our local clinic.

Until this day, our best guess is that this started it all. We don't know how, or why, but after this disease most of my absolutely unexplainable symptoms started. What do I mean by unexplainable? Well.

After I got the antibiotics for the angina, everything was fine for about a week until the treatment ended. A few days before that I had what we then assumed was a yeart infection. I had never had one before, my doctor said the symptoms checked out and I got treated for that. The symptoms didn't go away as soon as  they should've, but maybe in \~10 days. I was kind of busy with the section below so it went unnoticed.

**JOINTS:** Just days after the yeast infection I noticed some weird rashes on my elbows. Also, surprisingly included in the mega bomb of pictures [here](https://imgur.com/a/DMqpdKM), are the two pictures of my elbows. The rash was mostly red dots, not painful or itchy unless you touched it. One of them developed some yellow in the center. It was symmetric all along my body, starting in elbows, then showing up in knees and ankles. Always on both sides at the same time. This on it's own wouldn't be too concerning, but the next day all of the spots with rash were also extremely swollen, hot, red and painful. I could barely walk. That's when the first blood test with the highest infection count was taken, and when it passed in a few days before I could get to someone who knows about rashes or joints, we just ruled it as some kind of joint infection most likely caused by some autoimmune reaction.

It has happened 3 times since, every single time being extremely painful, scary and going away within a week. However we have found no actual explanation for it. My doctor said they tested for Rheumatoid arthritis, but can't rule it out.\^TLDR: After getting angina, I started having episodes where my autoimmune system seems to attack itself, causing mostly joint centered problems.

**""IN MY HEAD""/MENTAL SYMPTOMS:** There are multiple symptoms that affect me mentally, the strongest one being tiredness. Always during these ""episodes"" and sometimes outside of them, I'm so tired I will fall asleep sitting on the bus even if I slept a normal amount before it. I will just sleep and sleep and sleep, no matter what I do. I just actually can't stay awake. I usually have a slight fever, but nothing to be worried about. At a point I was admitted to the hospital because I literally slept 23 hours and didn't wake up even when I wet myself, which I have never done after being a toddler. After sleeping there for another 18 hours I woke up slightly less tired and was finally sent home with no answers.

In the past few months I've also started stuttering and having brain fog. If I'm actively in a conversation, I will stutter once every 2-5 minutes, and sometimes I will stutter the same word closer to 10 times before finally getting over it. I never before have stuttered at all, so this is weird and annoying.

With the brain fog, it seems to be mostly when I get up and start moving after being inactive for a while. For example in the morning when I leave for school, or when I after class get up. It's not every time and is always not related to activity, but just thought I'd point it out. I feel like my head is just... not functioning properly. Everything feels extremely slow and fast at the same time and for the first time in my life, I've experienced trouble focusing. Sometimes I also experience blurry vision or dizzyness at the same time, but not sure if there is a connection or not.

I have yet to talk about these to any doctor, just my school nurse, who didn't seem too concerned. However to me, they are really just hard to deal with.\^TLDR: My head is sometimes foggy, dizzy and almost always tired.

**DIGESTIVE SYSTEM:** In the past few years eating has become sort of difficult. I usually eat a light breakfast around 6, then either in school at 12 or when I get home at 15. Sometimes I will eat a heavier meal in the evening, sometimes another light one like bread. I have always functioned like this, and most days I'm fine like that.

However these changes have made it so I can't really eat. In school I'm more often hungry, but when I go to eat I will feel full after literally eating a few bites. Some days it will be even worse, and when I get home I will again be really hungry but unable to eat without feeling sick. More often than not I can still eat a normal amount for me, but I really hate the days when my stomach just decides it doesn't want food.

I've had some weeks where I often throw up for no explanation, but I can also keep some food down and don't feel otherwise sick.

On a more unpleasent note, I've also been suffering with constipation a lot. I've always been kind of a seldom pooper, maybe 1-2 times a week. However this autumn I had a 2 month period where I pooped twice. I tried taking stool softeners and laxatives but there was literally no effect, until my doctor gave me a stronger one that worked after about a week. After that it's been a bit rarer than usual, maybe once every two weeks, but luckily not as bad. The stool is actually not even all that hard, big or painful, it just feels like it doesn't really move all that fast while in there.\^TLDR: I can't eat normal portion sizes most days. Also had bad constipation.

**TOLERANCE/LOW EFFECTIVENESS:** Another thing that might or might not be related to the digestive system. I have a high tolerance for many substances. Actually I'm not really sure if it's as much high tolerance as it's just that they take a very long time to effect, if they do at all. While ""substances"" sounds rather illegal, I'm actually talking about sedatives and caffeine. Because I'm so sensitive to pain, I often get sedatives before dentists or in this example, the bone marrow biopsy. During the first 3 times I got it at the dentists, I got it 30 minutes before as recommended, since it should start effecting you in about 20 minutes. However it actually started effecting me once I got home, almost 1,5 hours later. Last time I got a slightly stronger sedative an hour before and it worked much better.

When it comes to caffeine, I don't have this scientific amounts to give, but it has never really affected me in any way. While my mom has always started feeling bad after just half a cup of coffee or an energy drink, neither affect me at all, even in bigger quantities. I have never drank more than 2 energy drinks at a time, but felt absolutely no difference.

And then there's alcohol. I first started drinking alcohol about 6 months ago, in a safe environment in small quantities. When the 3rd time came around, I had still never even felt tipsy. My boyfriend weighs a noticeable amount more than me, and so do many other men there. They are all also more used to alcohol. I wanted to feel something, so I started drinking shots with one of them. He's older than me, bigger than me and more used to alcohol, being one of the biggest drinkers there. I outdrank him and while I felt slightly tipsy after that, he threw up.

On New years eve I decided to take a bit more, and was honestly shocked at home much I could drink without any problems. A lot of the guys that didn't know me were so sure that I'd throw up any minute and kept giving me shots, and but I was fine. The only ""drunk"" thing I did all night was forgetting my phone in the bedroom, which is rare for me. When we got home I started feeling slightly weird, but that was literally 6 hours after I stopped drinking.

My mom and everyone else is super confused about this, calling it my ""unuseful superpower"". Honestly it just bothers me. I hate feeling like there's something wrong with me. I would just like to add that I am still drinking responsibly and there's no need to worry.

&#x200B;

**AUTOIMMUNE:** Everyone's best guess at this point is some kind of autoimmune disease that we just can't lock down, so we're trying to slowly rule out other possibilities. I just have a lot of symptoms that are kind of random but could definitely be explained by the body attacking itself, like constant fatigue and tiredness, muscle/joint/nerve pain and stiffness, slighty higher than normal hair loss and low fevers from time to time. One peculiar symptom is canker sores or mouth ulcers that always come at the same time as other symptoms, sometimes making my mouth hurt so bad I can't eat for days.

AskDocs,"I am at a loss. I don't know what to ask or what is wrong, but tests aren't helping.","I'm looking for anything that can help me figure out what is going on with me. 

A bit about me: I am a 25 year old Caucasian female, 5'4.5"" and 190 lbs (losing weight currently) taking 37.5 mg Phentermine daily for the last 30 days. Vegetarian for almost a year, not a drinker (no drinking at all while taking this medication), no tobacco use, occasionally vaping marijuana/edibles when I can get appropriate products from dispensaries.  Mostly as sleep aid/anti anxiety since I have adverse reactions to benzos and most other anti anxiety medications. Had that habit for almost 7 years now so I assume it's unrelated as well. Just trying to be detailed. 

I have been experiencing some very unusual new symptoms as far as my uterus goes. I've *always* experienced painful, but relatively short periods. As in, stay home and often end up vomiting, in tears, or both, with little relief from OTC medication, and lasting anywhere from 3-5 days maximum. 

My long term partner and I do not want children. Ever. And since oral birth control was hard for me to remember to take, and the few brands I had been on made me a bit.. sensetive, emotionally, I decided to try out an IUD. A bonus was that every single one of my friends with one had their periods completely stop within a year. 

Well, it's been over 19 months since my IUD was placed and my periods didn't ever lighten up. Which was fine I guess, we didn't have to worry about me forgetting to take my pill, and my emotions haven't been out of whack. Or they weren't, until December of 2019. Let me explain a bit more. 

In December I was working long days and was a bit stressed trying to get in all my clients for Christmas. I noticed I started my period probably a week early, on December 21st- which was weird, because I was always within like a 21-28 day schedule. But I thought it was maybe stress induced. I didn't *feel* overly stressed, but bodies can be weird. I bled for 8 days straight. Heavy, clotty blood. ""Definitely odd... I'll keep note of that.""

January 11th, 2020.. I had some pain on my right ovary before it started so I thought maybe I had a cyst rupture. I had had one known cyst before, and it felt maybe similar. Pain in that area tends to radiate after a little while so it's hard to tell. So, I took a nap, went to the bathroom, and was spotting. Within 12 hours I was in a full blown heavy period again, this one lasting until the 19th. Again, I made note of it but thought maybe my early period had thrown my cycle off.. I try to not panic or overthink things right away so I wanted to see. 

February 3, 2020... Severe cramping, again. Within a couple hours of this cramping I was bleeding again. I had a bit of an anxiety attack and sat in a hot bathtub with shooting cramping pain. I felt/feel like my body has straight up given up on me. I made an appointment with my doctor that placed my IUD (Mirena, August 2018) for the 11th. I bled until the 13th.

I was still bleeding but had a false stop the morning of my appointment. I couldn't help but cry when she came in to see me. I am scared, emotional, and confused. She ordered a Thyroid test, suggested I start oral birth control medication to level out my hormones to start, and said it was either PMDD, Endometriosis or PCOS. She also made note to tell me that sometimes endometriosis isn't apparent on ultrasounds because it shows up as healthy tissue, which won't look abnormal, and the only way to diagnose me with that is exploratory surgery. 

We got a pelvic ultrasound scheduled for later that week. If the birth control doesn't work, she can give me a shot that she says ""induces a false menopause"", which sounds horrible in and of itself.. or we could get me started on Prozac.. which I am not really okay with, and I feel like was only brought up because of my anxiety disorder. This isn't my anxiety manifesting. I was crying and emotional because I have been having periods between every 14-16 days with 8-9 days of heavy bleeding. 
But, not knowing what else to do, I agree to the oral birth control medication along with keeping my IUD. 

My thyroid came back normal. 

No sign of PCOS or Endometriosis on the transvaginal ultrasound. I did have a 2 cm cyst on my right ovary but it is singular. 

Now... I'm kind of frustrated because I wanted to get some answers and she seemed very confident that it was one of the 3 issues. I personally don't understand how it could be PMDD. I've always had heightened emotions around my period.. why would it be PMDD if the only reason I'm feeling emotional more often than I'm used to is because I'm inexplicably bleeding significantly more than I have in my life? To me I feel like maybe it's PMDD *and* something else, but a stand alone diagnosis doesn't make sense when PMDD doesn't cause periods to happen, it's a side effect *of* periods. 

I also am wary of taking oral birth control medication. I sort of feel like I shouldn't be taking anything without more tests done. The only things we even tested for/did were the ones described above. I have a family history of Endometriosis, PCOS, and one of my aunts gets periods so severe she often needs blood transfusions. I don't mean to automatically sound distrustful but I don't really want to just have a blanket cover for my symptoms when something is *definitely* wrong here. I don't know.


Truthfully I'd love to have a hysterectomy but leave my ovaries intact, but being so young, with no children, and in Utah of all places... My chances are so low it isn't funny. I just feel like I don't know what's going on with myself and nothing has been answered and without going on hormones for the rest of my life until I have to start taking hormones for menopause.. it just doesn't feel right. I don't know what to do.

AskDocs,"I am pregnant and had to wean off of my adderall, how long until it's cleared from the baby's system and will be withdraw from Prozac?","31 female, white
About 200 pounds, 5'1.
Never smoker, occasional drinker but not since AI got pregnant.
Medications are: Prozac 60mg, ambien 2.5mg-5 MG as needed for sleep. Tylenol as needed, famotadine and tums as needed (but daily almost), and I've had to take vistaril 25mg for a break through anxiety attack a few weeks ago. (discontinued) Adderall regular 10mg up to 3x a day weaned off over about a month

I have a history of anxiety, adhd, severe depression, post partum depression from my last pregnancy. 

Current conditions 26 weeks pregnant (due in July) and have been on pelvic rest and light duty since late December due to bleeding and losing blood clots. OBGYN checked thoroughly and ultrasounds show health cervix, no issues, and a visual examination of my cervix and vaginal walls are intact and no tearing, so it was ruled a ""leaky blood vessel"". Amniotic fluid is great, and anatomy scan showed a very healthy, organs all in place with good blood flow, baby boy. 

Bit of back story - I found out I was pregnant in December when I was further along than I realized because I was still having a ""period"" (the spotting and bleeding I was experiencing that ultimately put me on pelvic rest a few weeks later). Okay so I have been on Prozac since before I gave birth to my second child in Nov 2016, I want to say I started it in late September because my depression was making me go a little crazy. Our home flooded in Louisiana so add that to the stress of a new baby. That baby did great, and I stayed on my low dose of Prozac for almost a year claiming things were fine but was really dealing with serious PPD. I finally stepped up and got help and since then I am now up to 60mg of Prozac daily. My insurance does not cover any name adhd medications or XR, so I have been on 10 MG Adderall up to 3x a day for about 2ish years. 

When I found out I was pregnant, I didn't want to just stop taking the Adderall so I decided it was best for me to slowly wean off. In the past if I abruptly stopped I had some really angry withdrawal symptoms, so I talked it over with my OB and Pysch and while understanding the risks, I weaned off much slower than I maybe should have. But I'm finally off of it. However after what happened during my last pregnancy I felt it was safer for me to stay on that treatment, because if I tried to do without medication again I was terrified of what I'd do to myself or my unborn baby. I had full support from both doctors. Well, the support that is tied with their cautions of course.

Okay so I stopped taking the Adderall around January/February-ish, but still on Prozac. I know both can cause the baby to withdraw once he's born. How long would the Adderall be effective in his system if I stopped taking it in January and presumably go full term to July, is there a risk he would still have any in his system to cause him to withdraw? Would the Prozac exacerbate anything or bc the Prozac is still in my system so it would be in his, would that affect how the Adderall leaves? And with the Adderall being a low dose to begin with then wean down to, does that make a difference as to whether he may withdraw at all from it? How many weeks does it take to clear their system in utero? I've seen reports that some women are going into preterm labor when they got sick so if I somehow deliver early could the Adderall still be there? 

I figure there's a chance he will withdraw from the Prozac, and I feel ashamed I still have to take it but I can't put my family through that again. My 7 year old son was terrified of me for weeks after. I just know amphetamines can be worse when it comes to withdrawing in infants so to combine the two now is really scaring me.

AskDocs,Could it be Neurogenic Bladder Disorder?,"Hey there,

Ok, first I'm a 31yo female, 167cm, 120kg, I have PCOS along with the following. I have a child who was born naturally almost 10 years ago, and do have problems with a prolapse due to birth (36h labour, 2.5h pushing, episiotomy and suction assisted birth). 

So I'm pretty medically sufficient due to having long term and short term health conditions and having a strong interest in anatomy and physiology.

Relevant medical history for this particular issue is Degenerative Disc Disease which has caused nerve root compression from a herniated disc at L4-L5 and nerve root compression from osteophyte formation at L5-S1. This has caused severe chronic pain, severe Sciatic pain and mobility issues. 

So far I have tried several different medications to have with the pain, including Targin and Endone together, however have found an effective regime with Panadeine Forte and Naproxen. A list of all meds I take are:
Panadeine Forte (2 x 4-6 time a day)
Naproxen (1 tablet twice a day)
Esomeprazole (40mg x day)
Sertraline (200mg a day)
Endep (2 tablets at night)
Diazepam (5-10mg as needed)
Ural (urine alkaliser, two sachets I've a day when needed).
I have also had a spinal nerve injection (corticosteroid I think) at the L5-S1 level as a diagnostic tool for the neurosurgeon and spinal specialist team. It didn't help the pain at all, in fact it made it worse for 7/8 days, then my pain lowered to its usual level.

I think that's all of it. OKAY into the issue. 

I have what I can only describe as an irritable bladder - the feeling is the same as a UTI but without the other symptoms; there is no fever, no burning on urination. It just feels like a full bladder all the time. 

Ural, a urine alkaliser available over the counter, seems to help settle the feeling down, but otherwise it's 24h a day, and has been going on for about two months. It started before the nerve injection. I do recall noticing a slight improvement in the bladder issue after the injection for a day or two, then it returned.

The problem is, I have this stupid anxiety/fear about urine and stool sample tests. I did mention to my doctor a month or so ago and he gave me a dose of antibiotics which didn't seem to help. I know my doc will need a urine sample and is likely to ask me to do a 24h urine test... But even the thought of that is terrifying to me for some reason. It's irrational, I know. 

Is there anyone on here who can help me? I do see my Dr every fortnight (I'm in Australia) so I will mention it, but I just need to know if there's anything else I can try at home. I've tried increasing my water intake (2-4 700ml bottles a day) which hasn't helped.",1,2,2020-01-24,full term birth
AskDocs,"Do Omeprazole and Pepcid/Zantac heal stomach, or just mask symptoms?","I am 41, female, 5'5"", 150 lbs and no underlying health conditions other than PTSD and anxiety. I'm allergic to everything in the avelox family as well as lexapro and prozac (and doc said to just avoid all SSRI's since lexapro and prozac cause tachycardia), and need to avoid caffeine because it also causes tachycardia (particularly from drinks like Bai and beachbody pre-workout powder).

I had a telehealth appointment with my doctor on Monday (in place of my annual physical until I can safely reschedule), and she told me to take either 2 pepcid/zantac or 1 omeprazole per day for 2 weeks. I am wondering if these drugs actually heal my stomach or simply mask symptoms, a la tylenol not actually healing injuries but instead just masking the pain. I'd rather not take anything if it's just going to mask the symptoms and not actually heal anything. 

I did read this morning that Zantac has been recalled due to increased risk for cancer-causing properties the longer it sits on a shelf(?). I have 4 leftover bottles of omeprazole from when she previously prescribed it to me to take regularly for several months several years ago. Two bottles expired in December 2019 and two expired in February 2020, so I'm using those first. I took one pill yesterday morning on an empty stomach, and one pill this morning on an empty stomach waiting 30 minutes to eat thereafter. So, I'm wondering if I should be ordering a brand new box of pepcid instead of the expired omeprazole. 

I tend to start to get ulcer like symptoms after consuming acidic foods and beverages, which I've had more of lately since I'm not able to be too picky about what food we have in the house now. But I did have a glass of wine and a few ounces of hard cider last week, and a sip of my significant other's coffee, so that probably kicked this into high gear. 

I've been having issues with my food getting stuck in the back of my throat while I'm eating and having to cough it back up a little and take a sip of water to properly swallow it. I mentioned this to my doctor Monday, and she said this is caused by acid reflux. I don't feel particularly refluxy, so I was surprised by this, but happy to try the medication for 2 weeks to see if it helps. She also told me to stop eating fatty foods, cheese, simple white carbs and spicy food, and sugar. 

Doc also prescribed me 0.5 mg of loreazepam, but I can't pick it up, since ""controlled substances"" do not qualify for pharmacy delivery. My daughter and s.o. are high risk, so I refuse to go anywhere in public during this pandemic until it's long over.",1,8,2020-04-02,late delivery

The dog snuck up on me completely unprovoked & aggressive. There were 5 other dogs on the property (all Springer Spaniels) & they kept their cool. The punctures are about 1/4 inches deep & I saw a medical professional yesterday who wants me on antibiotics so an infection doesn't pop up. The police officer I was in contact with regarding the incident has confirmed that the dog has never been vaccinated. They live on a farm so it is possible for the dog to be scratched or bitten from a wild animal & is in the beginning stages of rabies. The officer also will not get back to me about if the dog is being quarantined or not. I'm in a situation where I have to decide if cautious is the right answer (I think it is) & if I'm being overly dramatic. This is all coming out of pocket for the expense so it would be about $3,000 for the full dosage. 

Should I get the vaccine? Is it too late for me to receive the proper treatment? What should I do? I'm terrified.

NICUParents,How long did you go with your second / third pregnancy?,"Hi friends,   


My daughter was born three years ago at 33w3d after an uneventful, healthy pregnancy due to PPROM. We never figured out what caused the PPROM; there was no infection, cervical shortening wasn't confirmed, etc. 

We were lucky; we only spent 17 days in the NICU before taking her home healthy. But still, as I'm sure you can relate, our little one being in the NICU was one of the most stressful times of our lives and one that I'm not eager to repeat.   


Here I am 21w3d pregnant with my second baby. I thought that my daughter being born so early was a fluke and that it wouldn't happen again, but my OB was monitoring me pretty closely and found that I had a drop in cervical length between 18 and 20 weeks from 4.7cm to 2.6-3.0cm which is pretty dramatic. 

I'm on progesterone suppositories and go in again today, a week after my last, for another ultrasound. My OB has suggested I'll probably get a cerclage put in, and I'm not sure how effective they are, but I'm still really interested to hear...

NICUParents,Just joined this club on Thursday and looking for some support and advice.,"Hi everyone. On Thursday I gave birth to my baby boy via c-section at 28 weeks and 2 days. He‚Äôs doing great in the NICU but I‚Äôm really struggling for a few reasons. I‚Äôm here in the hospital alone because of the pandemic (my husband is waiting out a self-quarantine because of international travel and won‚Äôt be able to visit until Sunday. He was able to attend the birth with proper distancing and protocol). I‚Äôm pumping every two hours and in a lot of pain from the operation so I‚Äôm reliant on the nurses for absolutely everything - helping me shift stuff around my room, adjusting lights, washing pump parts, etc. - and I‚Äôm constantly meeting with nurses, doctors, case managers, lactation consultants, calling down to the NICU, etc.

Because I‚Äôm handling this alone it‚Äôs been really hard for me to actually spend lots of time at the NICU with my baby. I manage maybe two visits a day and I feel incredibly guilty. I know lots of time holding him and doing skin to skin is best for him but I‚Äôm in a situation where I pump and then a bunch of people poke their heads in to lay a bunch of information on my lap and they have to draw blood or flush my IV or push on my stomach and by then it‚Äôs time to pump again and I try to rush down to the NICU and I have fifty bazillion missed texts/calls because everyone wants to see the baby and I‚Äôm just so tired dealing with it by myself. My sister in law has been here for a few hours every day with me (I‚Äôve been in the hospital since March 7 due to risk of preterm labor) and she‚Äôs been great but it‚Äôs really hard at night when I‚Äôm exhausted.

I know I only have to get through another 24 hours before my husband gets here but it‚Äôs just been so tough. I meditate, I look at photos of my baby and my older son, I still feel like I struggle. I delivered my oldest child vaginally at full term and did not anticipate this level of helplessness, moreover doing it in a pandemic where traditional ways people would help (babysitting my older son so husband can help, visiting me in the hospital) have been taken off the table by doctors.

NICUParents,Told to expect a premature baby and he is already smaller than he should be,"Hi everyone. I don‚Äôt know where else to post or if I should post here but cautious baby bumps forwarded me to this subreddit.

I‚Äôm currently 25 weeks pregnant with my first baby who was conceived via IVF after years of trying. I‚Äôm only 23 years old.

8 days ago, I was having abdominal pain and tightening so headed to labour and delivery. They noted my cervix was closed, however a test they ran came back highly suggestive for preterm labour. They kept me in hospital for a week, giving me steroids for baby‚Äôs lungs and monitoring me and I was allowed to come home 2 days ago. 

Today I went for a growth scan and was sadly told baby is only measuring at 23 weeks and 5 days. He also only weighs around 660 grams. At 25 weeks they would expect him to be weighing more.

My OBGYN told me that in ‚Äònormal‚Äô circumstances my pregnancy wouldn‚Äôt be too worrying and I‚Äôd likely just have a small baby at term, but because he is expected early it is now worrying. 

Another preterm labour test was run and again came back positive. It‚Äôs likely I will go into labour within the next week or two if the test wasn‚Äôt wrong. I have been told I can have magnesium sulphate if I go into active labour. I‚Äôm constantly in pain abdominally but nobody really knows why, so this is just treated with pain killers.

Has anyone got any words of hope at all for me? I‚Äôm heartbroken. I saw 25 weeks as such a milestone as I was told most preemies do well after 25 weeks but my little boy isn‚Äôt measuring at 25 weeks at all especially with a low weight of 660g.

NICUParents,27 Weeks 1 Day,"Well the placental insufficiency got worse and Tessa Marie decided to come into the world early. She was born 2:02 PM 1 lbs 2 oz a 11 in long. She is doing great and just a tiny bit small. I had to wait forever to see her due to pain during delivery but she was worth the wait. Sounds like I‚Äôll be able to touch her in 3 days which seems so far away. I‚Äôm doing great with pain now and so far just been taking Tylenol.

NICUParents,Meconium & prolapsed cord. I just need to tell someone.,"I‚Äôm so sad to have to be writing this. I don‚Äôt know anyone else personally whose has had a baby in the NICU. 

My pregnancy was perfect. I had absolutely no complications. He was scheduled for an induction a few days early at 40+5. My doctor asked if I wanted to wait till week 41 or go early. I‚Äôve been so worried that pregnancy, my second, and asked if I could come a few days earlier. I‚Äôm so grateful that I did now. 

They were supposed to give me a foley bulb, but instead I received what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúcook‚Äù? And told to come back in 24hrs, 7pm on Monday. I was having intense contractions all night into the next day.. when we got to the hospital I was in so, so much pain and having intense back labor. 

They checked me and found I was 8cm. 

His heart kept dropping and the doctor, who I hadn‚Äôt met her, explained she was so concerned about him fluctuating she came as soon as she finished two other deliveries. She checked me and broke my waters, where they found so, so much meconium. She came back after my epidural to see if she could flush me out with what looked like saline? But when she felt again she felt his cord and immediately told the nurses, ‚ÄúProlapsed cord,‚Äù and I started to cry. I knew what that meant. My husband had no clue, he was so confused. 

They told me I had to have an immediate c-section and I cried the whole way there. I had the sweetest nurse my entire time. She was wonderful. 

He was born at 10:22pm on 4/20. I saw him for maybe 5-10 seconds before he was taken away. They gave me a stronger dose of medicine with my epidural that put me to sleep while they cleaned me. 

I was taken to a room with a lot of empty beds and the nurse eventually called for my husband. He was crying. This is the second time in my life I‚Äôve ever seen him cry. The doctor had explained to him because of the distress myself & him were in, they were concerned for his lack of oxygen, which was borderline. They took out so much meconium from his body. 

They told us he would be using a cooling vest, where he is now. They told us the concern was his body would try to produce too much oxygen too fast and cause a fever and/or seizures. We‚Äôre so grateful he‚Äôs stabilized. He hasn‚Äôt had any seizures and even though he‚Äôs still on oxygen, he‚Äôs doing okay. 

My husband and I cope differently. I know he believes I should be there every hour of every day. They‚Äôre only letting one parent in and we agreed it would be me. But every time I go to see him, I cry. I‚Äôm so happy he‚Äôs okay. But I can‚Äôt stop crying for so many reasons. I cry because he‚Äôs okay, but so uncomfortable. I cry when he cries that I can‚Äôt hold him and worry he‚Äôll think no one cares and will come help him. Everyone has said it‚Äôs not my fault, but I still place the blame on myself somehow. 

The doctor was so kind. She did express that she truly felt if we had waited until his exact 41w and then some for a later induction, he might not have been okay. In her words, ‚ÄúI truly believe we would‚Äôve had a different outcome.‚Äù She told me they wouldn‚Äôt have let me get so far in my pregnancy if everything hadn‚Äôt been going so well. 

He was in a ‚Äúsunny side up‚Äù position and his head was more to my right side instead of straight down, allowing the cord to slip past him first. It was also the reason I was having such severe back labor. 

Thank you for anyone who reads. I just needed to write it out. I never imagined I would have to leave the hospital without him. I‚Äôm just so very sad.",14,16,2020-04-22,early delivery
NICUParents,Full-term envy,"My family are all arranging daily dinner time zoom chats to stay in touch during the pandemic. My mom is currently staying with us to help out and my dad is super lonely and bored at his house, so she‚Äôs all about this.

NICUParents,How to prepare for NICU stay?,"I'm so amazed by the support this community provides and I have a few questions.

This pregnancy has been all kinds of complicated (monochorionic twins who developed TTTS and had to be operated... then PPROM) and because of it, the C-section is planned for week 32. I am currently at 26 weeks and trying to prepare for the extended NICU stay. At least, we can consider ourselves lucky to know ahead of time that our babies will be in the NICU for while and prepare.


Will I get to see my babies when they are born or will they be too young for any kind of skin to skin? Will I be able to visit them while I recover from the C-section at the hospital?
After I get discharged (~4 days), how long should I spend at the NICU everyday? Will I get to take care of my babies?
What will life be like with two little ones in the hospital? I'm assuming I will also have to limit my contact with people to avoid getting sick?

NICUParents,Posting to vent. Found out my husband [30M] has been seeing prostitutes during my [27F] entire pregnancy and baby‚Äôs NICU stay.,"I really just want to talk to someone and vent because I‚Äôm feeling so broken and alone. My husband is the most perfect man on the surface, even my dad who is a psychologist didn‚Äôt see through him. But I think he‚Äôs a sociopath. I had the worst pregnancy of all time, I lost 30 pounds because id throw up even from drinking water. 2 months into it, My best friend died an unexpected and particularly gruesome/preventable death two days after my birthday. I found out that two days after her death, he made a bunch of affair profiles. My baby came 4 months early at only 1 lb and was only given a 50/50 chance to live. The whole time we were in the NICU my husband was going to see prostitutes, some of whom he knew were trafficking victims/had been drugged. He‚Äôs been to multiple massage parlors for happy endings and has talked with multiple women he‚Äôs met online. I confronted him on it and he‚Äôs still doing that stuff but just more sneakily thinking I don‚Äôt know. He left my baby alone at the house to go buy MDMA from his drug dealer and spend $1000 which was supposed to be for baby‚Äôs medical bills on a prostitute one night when I offered to watch the baby for him so he could go to a friends house. My baby is very medically needy being that he‚Äôs premature, he‚Äôs hooked up to a lot of machinery and he‚Äôs immuneocompromised so I can‚Äôt just take him and leave. I‚Äôm living in a different country so I can‚Äôt just drive to someone I know. I‚Äôm completely alone here with this sociopath and a sick baby. I‚Äôm dying mentally having to be around him, he made me fall so in love and give him a baby just to destroy me like this. The only thing keeping me from just killing myself are my elderly parents and baby. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I dint think there‚Äôs anything I can do since baby‚Äôs sick and will be hooked up to machines for the foreseeable future. So I‚Äôm stuck in this house, in a sexless marriage, being cheated on and disrespected constantly, neglected and left to watch this baby alone all day. No job (can‚Äôt drive), no friends, no family. Alone :( I‚Äôm sorry this isn‚Äôt very coherent but I really feel like I‚Äôm falling apart and I just need someone to hear me.

TLDR: can‚Äôt leave my sociopath cheating husband because I have a very sick child hooked up to machinery. Living in a different country with no family or friends. I‚Äôm stuck in a house with him while he continually abuses and cheats on me and leaves me to tend to the baby all to myself.",17,13,2020-02-23,NICU stay

I‚Äôm in hospital yet again due to contractions. So far only every 15 minutes and docs aren‚Äôt sure if it is my bowels playing around (I suffer from IBS and the pain sometimes resembles contractions but we cannot take any chances with recent events). I‚Äôm pretty sure it won‚Äôt be long now until baby makes his appearance, sadly I am only 25 weeks and 4 days. I‚Äôm grateful however that we made it this far - I was previously told I‚Äôd deliver at 23 weeks and 4 days. 

A few days ago, we had a growth scan and boy was measuring about 7 days behind where he should be. He was in the 50th percentile for a baby at 24 weeks, and the 17-20th percentile for a baby of his age (25 weeks)

They couldn‚Äôt tell me why. My placenta function is normal. It‚Äôs all been very worrying.

Husband and I were disheartened as we always assumed if we got to 25 weeks he‚Äôd have a better chance. In the leaflet our NICU gave us, they state most babies born after 25 weeks survive if they have had magnesium and steroids. He has had both (currently at it with the magnesium anyway)

I was then told by a pretty unsupportive family member yesterday (who has had three full term babies) that because our boy technically isn‚Äôt the size of a 25 weeker his chances are lower. However, I‚Äôve read a few comments on this subreddit and google where preemie parents have been told its more gestational age that matters rather than baby‚Äôs measurements on percentile charts from ultrasounds. I actually spoke to one mom who said that preemies who are small for gestational age have usually put their energy more towards organ development so they often fair well.

Little dude has definitely been in there for 25 weeks and 4 days. We can‚Äôt explain his small size away by confused conception dates because he is an IVF baby.

NICUParents,"22 weeks preterm labor, in the hospital on strict bedrest, hoping I stay pregnant for at least another few weeks. Any advice, please?","I posted this on r/babybump and someone suggested I repost it here. 

Sorry if this is not well written. I had a bad reaction to  an ambien last night and they had to give me something to calm down.

I went to my obgyn with a back ache and my stomach feeling tense. They did an ultrasound and found my cervix had thinned to a .5 (should be 4cm) she immediately sends me to her husband, a high risk doctor in the hopes he could put in a purse stitch to keep it closed.

By the time they got me in for anther ultrasound there an hour later I had dialated 3-4 centimeters and had a bulging bag.

They called an ambulance to take me to the nearest hospital with a level 3 nicu because we decided we want to do everything everything possible to save his life short of chest compressions (which can cause brain bleeding) and emergency c section, at least until week 24.

Right now my goal is to reach week 24 so he can get steroids to help develop him lungs but I'm afraid I won't make it. We are just trying to take it day by day. 

We started on labor and delivery and it seemed like it would be ok. The nurses were all amazing and so helpful even though I had to pee like 30  a day because of the iv and they had to come help me use the bed pan.

But now I'm in antepartum because they believe labor isn't eminent and it seems like they just don't care very much here. I feel like I'm very much on my own now.

I will start magnesium if I begin having regular contractions, but right now I'm just on antibiotics. (and colace, and bean-o). 

I'm on strict bedrest. It's horrible and uncomfortable and I have to use a bedpan. Does anybody have any advice to be more comfortable, more calm, how I can help my baby grow strong quickly, and especially how I can stop from going into official labor? Or anything else. I feel like shit for having this crappy body that can't do anything right. It took us nine years to get pregnant. I'm not sure if I will survive if I lose this baby.",53,49,2020-02-16,weeks pregnant
NICUParents,Just joined this club on Thursday and looking for some support and advice.,"Hi everyone. On Thursday I gave birth to my baby boy via c-section at 28 weeks and 2 days. He‚Äôs doing great in the NICU but I‚Äôm really struggling for a few reasons. I‚Äôm here in the hospital alone because of the pandemic (my husband is waiting out a self-quarantine because of international travel and won‚Äôt be able to visit until Sunday. He was able to attend the birth with proper distancing and protocol). I‚Äôm pumping every two hours and in a lot of pain from the operation so I‚Äôm reliant on the nurses for absolutely everything - helping me shift stuff around my room, adjusting lights, washing pump parts, etc. - and I‚Äôm constantly meeting with nurses, doctors, case managers, lactation consultants, calling down to the NICU, etc.

Because I‚Äôm handling this alone it‚Äôs been really hard for me to actually spend lots of time at the NICU with my baby. I manage maybe two visits a day and I feel incredibly guilty. I know lots of time holding him and doing skin to skin is best for him but I‚Äôm in a situation where I pump and then a bunch of people poke their heads in to lay a bunch of information on my lap and they have to draw blood or flush my IV or push on my stomach and by then it‚Äôs time to pump again and I try to rush down to the NICU and I have fifty bazillion missed texts/calls because everyone wants to see the baby and I‚Äôm just so tired dealing with it by myself. My sister in law has been here for a few hours every day with me (I‚Äôve been in the hospital since March 7 due to risk of preterm labor) and she‚Äôs been great but it‚Äôs really hard at night when I‚Äôm exhausted.

I know I only have to get through another 24 hours before my husband gets here but it‚Äôs just been so tough. I meditate, I look at photos of my baby and my older son, I still feel like I struggle. I delivered my oldest child vaginally at full term and did not anticipate this level of helplessness, moreover doing it in a pandemic where traditional ways people would help (babysitting my older son so husband can help, visiting me in the hospital) have been taken off the table by doctors.

Have any of you been in a similar situation and have tips/advice for me, or just words of support? Thanks in advance for the wisdom of this group!",29,23,2020-03-21,full term birth
NICUParents,My introduction - Hi everyone - 27 weeker,"How my NICU story starts is to know that I love New Year's Eve. It has always been my favorite day. This year started off shaky and full of drama and tears. 2020, I will never forget watching the ball drop through tears at Toronto Mount Sinai Triage on the Maternity floor on a tiny little screen. 

It was yet another reminder how the end of 2019 was also not the greatest. I found out I was pregnant at end of July at the same time I found out I had breast cancer which turned out eventually to be Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer that spread to my bones. Little did I know, I wasn't going to see myself back home anytime soon after the NYE.

After the sad ball drop moment, our life turned upside down yet again. We learned yet another medical term. pPROM. Preterm Premature Rupture of Membrane. This basically means the membrane around the baby rips a tiny bit and the amnio fluid leaks out. This leaves the baby dry and open to infection. Dangerous situation. 

8 days of constant poking, monitoring, strapped in, immobilization, doctor consults, etc. The possibility was to actually stay in that state for weeks on end (some women can go full term). Was willing to do that, but ""someone"" had another plan. Our superstar wanted to make an entrance and just wanted to join the world a little early. We can call her and over-achiever already. Who needs full term when you can exit at 27 weeks?

She is tiny but being a trooper. 1 lb 10 oz. (740 g for our euro fans) Long road ahead in NICU (estimated 3 months). There was some issue with stabilizing her after birth. Her lungs took a while to get going. She has had her full first day in NICU. Already causing issues with her apnea events. And low blood pressure. Is anyone else dealing with this? They say it's normal?

I feel guilty that I wasn't able to hold on longer. I feel guilty that I feel great physically and she is struggling to breath. How do people deal with this?",40,16,2020-01-10,full term birth

NICUParents,27 + 2 week birth story. I apologize for the length.,"To everyone who is currently in the NICU going through the daily grind - stay strong. Just know, that everyday your little one is getting stronger and fighting so hard to be in this world. 
Here is my sons birth story. I hope it gives you hope and gets you through the day today. 

May 17th was just like any other May Friday down the shore: that soon-to-be summer breeze, temperatures in the 70s, the air was filled with beach aromas while sun was shining on our backs as we were riding our bikes to The annual Seafood festival to have ourselves some delicious ... lobster rolls. And let me tell you, they did not disappoint. After a quick bike ride, my husband and I enjoyed walking around, eating all types of delicious food before heading back home for the night. We sat on the balcony of our apartment talking about how awesome it was that the school year was coming to an end, that I was 27 weeks pregnant and our baby looked perfect on every ultrasound; how we were going to really enjoy the summer down the shore before the baby would arrive in Mid August. We talked about going away on a hiking / nature trip to Maine in late June / July. The night was perfect‚Ä¶ Until it wasn‚Äôt. 

Sometime around 2 AM I woke up with minor pain in my stomach and what felt like Braxton Hicks contractions. There was nothing special about them, and after tossing and turning I went back to sleep until about 6 AM. My alarm was set for 7 because we were supposed to go upstate on a small 3 mile hike that same morning. Around 6 AM, the pain in my stomach was getting a little bit more intense, but I would probably rate it as a ‚Äú5‚Äù on a scale of 1-10. I thought that maybe the lobster roll the night before wasn‚Äôt such a great idea after all, and I decided to walk around the apartment to see if the pain was going to go away.

 Around 7 AM, I woke up my husband and told him that I didn‚Äôt think going hiking was the best idea because I was feeling off and my stomach kind of hurt. By that time, I was already consulting ‚ÄúDr. Google‚Äù on the difference between Braxton Hicks and real contractions, but in no way I was still convinced that I was in actual labor. This was NOTHING like what I have read about. The pain was there. It felt like cramps, but it wasn‚Äôt so mind-blowing / excruciating as the people had written about in the books. 

By 8 AM, I downloaded a contraction timing app because I was still trying to figure out whether these cramps were coming in steadily, or if I was just in some serious gas pain from devouring all the food last night. The ‚Äúcramps‚Äù were coming in every 3 - 4 minutes and lasted about a minute long. The cramps were intensifying. I asked my husband to make me breakfast because I was getting hungry, but couldn‚Äôt bring myself to make the food. 
After eating ¬Ω of the egg toast, I went to the bathroom and saw blood. We immediately called my midwife, explained the situation and were advised to come to the hospital ‚Äújust in case there was an issue‚Äù. By this point, I would say my ‚Äúcramps‚Äù were more like ‚Äúcontractions‚Äù at about level 7 of pain. Still manageable, but getting pretty painful. 

In the 10 minute car ride to the hospital - it hit me. The pain was breathtaking. It was real. I knew I was in labor. I knew it when I got the sensation that you get when you really have to go to the bathroom, and not to go ‚Äúnumber 1‚Äù.
I knew that something was wrong... The whole time I was telling myself aloud, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not having this baby today. I‚Äôm not. Why would I have this baby at 27 weeks? There is no reason to have the baby today. No way. I‚Äôm not having the baby today.‚Äù

When we got to the hospital, the nurses asked me to change into a gown for a cervical check in this sketchy-storage- looking room, but at that point I could have cared less where I was, or what I was doing. I just wanted the pain to stop. 

The midwife did the cervical check and said I was 100% dilated + 2. The baby was coming. The baby was almost here. They immediately wheeled me into the labor and delivery room. They said something about the NICU, and long hospital stay, and life support, and a bunch of other information which all combined into one big lump sum of blur I can‚Äôt remember to this day. What I remember was my husband standing next to me. I remember them hooking me up to the monitors and IVs. I remember thinking that ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt how it was supposed to happen. I‚Äôm supposed to have a peaceful labor. I‚Äôm supposed to give birth in August, not in May.‚Äù I remember telling the nurses that I couldn‚Äôt feel my arms and legs. They had apparently gone numb from the shock of the situation, and because I wasn‚Äôt getting enough oxygen, so the nurses were giving me extra oxygen via this weird-looking-oxygen bag. 
They told me that the NICU team was going to be at the delivery. Whatever that meant. What is NICU anyways? I had never even heard the words ‚ÄúNICU‚Äù before. 

11 people had walked into the room and I was told that with the next contraction, I needed to push. I couldn‚Äôt deal with it all. I just couldn't. I looked at my husband and said ‚ÄúLook at me. Just look at me. I can‚Äôt handle the people, just stay with me here and look at me.‚Äù Feeling absolutely terrified, I began to push. The sensation while pushing felt like my hips were going to dislocate and come out of their sockets. Just that type of pressure. But... given the pain, I finally was able to feel relief. The pain and working with contractions gave me purpose, where before, it was just excruciating pain - now, it was pain with purpose. So pushing with the contractions made the pain seem LESS and more purposeful.

After 5th contraction or sometime in that time frame I heard one of the nurses say ‚ÄúC-Section‚Äù. Panic slowly started to rise, and I tried as best as I could to listen to what was going on. This was traumatic enough. No C-section. No. This wasn‚Äôt going to happen. Not the surgery, not on top of everything else that‚Äôs happened.  

Apparently, the baby‚Äôs cord was coming out before the baby. And apparently this was a really bad thing. My midwife told me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt push. We‚Äôre going to try to move the cord. Don‚Äôt push, and when we tell you to push, you need to get this baby OUT.‚Äù 

I stopped pushing, and instead felt several sets of hands going in and shifting things around... Imagine feeling the worst pressure you‚Äôve ever felt in your life, and then feeling MORE pressure from something shifting the object that‚Äôs causing you the pressure. I can‚Äôt really explain it‚Ä¶ It just felt like my hips were going to dislocate and never come back to their original place. 
 
The midwife and the doctor were able to move the cord over, and when they told me to push, I knew this baby needed to come out NOW in order to avoid getting the surgery. I took all the strength I had and pushed as hard as I thought was possible. I think I might have screamed, and I had my eyes closed because everything was just simply too much to comprehend. All I remember was holding my husband‚Äôs hand and pushing really really hard. 
I felt instant relief and a whole lot of liquid gushing out of me. My husband let go of my hand because he needed to sit down and compose himself. 

The baby was to my left. He was wrapped in a clear plastic bag, 7 people around him. I didn‚Äôt know what they were doing. I just remember seeing him, and he was so so tiny. He was tiny, and blue. Not like blue from labor when you see babies come out in movies or documentaries. He was purple blue, like bruised up. His eyes were swollen shut and he had this tube in his mouth. One of the nurses tapped the tube on her side. She was breathing for him. Minutes after, they laid our son on my chest for the total of 30 seconds. We were able to get 2 pictures with him before the room cleared out and he was whisked away into the NICU. My husband followed the baby and I was left alone with the midwife and one of the nurses. My midwife held my hand and tried to explain what was going to happen now. I didn‚Äôt really understand. I couldn‚Äôt wrap my mind around everything. 

I remember asking her, ‚ÄúWhy? How could this have happened?‚Äù and her reply was that it looked like there was an issue with the placenta. Some of the placenta was slightly discolored when it came out and she thought that it was probably due to a placental abruption. Later on, after weeks of testing the placenta, this turned out to be true,  and the cause of birth was ‚Äúspontaneous placental abruption.‚Äù 
I couldn‚Äôt understand how a low-risk, completely healthy individual with absolutely no history of health conditions, pregnancy risks, someone who ate a healthy diet and exercised all throughout the pregnancy, someone who felt COMPLETELY fine the entire 27 weeks prior could just have a ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù placental abruption. I still don‚Äôt understand it. 

After my husband came back to the room, I was able to get up and walk over with him to the NICU to see my son. Shocked and in disbelief, I felt my deflated belly as I stood by his isolette and I felt like someone just ripped out this tiny little human being out of my body. I didn‚Äôt know how to feel. I didn‚Äôt know whether to be happy that he was alive, or whether to be sad because we didn't know if he was going to live. 

From the time we arrived at the hospital  ( 10:03 AM ) to his birth ( 10:49 AM ) to seeing him in an isolette ( 12:35 PM ), I just couldn‚Äôt wrap my mind around the events that happened. I couldn‚Äôt wrap my mind about how our lives were going to change. I couldn‚Äôt imagine that on this day we were going to begin the most difficult and, emotionally draining experience of our lives.

 I could go on and tell you about the events that unfolded in the next few days, but it would not be the point of this story. The point of the story is this - no matter how many books you read, documentaries you watch, people you talk to, birth classes you take, plans you make about the type of pregnancy / birth you‚Äôre going to have, sometimes things do not work out the way that you plan. It doesn‚Äôt matter what type of birth you‚Äôre planning to have, you MUST be prepared to face changes when things change. You must always be prepared for plans to NOT work out. The most important thing is the health of the baby and the mom. 

Our son spent 115 days in the NICU. He was sent home on 5 different medications, 2 different nebulizing treatments and an Apnea monitor. It has been over 9 months since his birth, but today, I am happy to say that he is the cutest little munchkin whose smile completely melts my heart. He is almost off of all of his meds, eating solids like a champ and learning to sit and crawl, while babbling his little heart out. 

He wasn‚Äôt born at 40 weeks, and I wasn‚Äôt able to breastfeed him because of him aspirating. Everything about my third trimester / birth / first 6 months of his life didn‚Äôt go as ‚Äúaccording to the plan‚Äù. But you know what? It could have been so much worse. We could have gone hiking. And he would have been born, and died somewhere in the woods. Or we could have lived further away from the hospital. The variations are endless‚Ä¶ Spending 115 days in the NICU was awful. Not knowing whether he would make it through the night at times was excruciating. So many other things straight up sucked. But at the end of the day, we are the luckiest parents in the world, who have a little tiny warrior at home who fought his way to be here. I know that after this experience, we can face anything as a family. 

And so will yours... stay strong NICU parents. It gets better.",72,17,2020-02-26,late delivery
NICUParents,Daughter born 1/29 at 34+4,"Hi All, I've been lurking since my wife got pregnant and we learned it would be a possibility of having a premie due to some underlying health conditions my wife has, previous losses, and a unicornuate uterus. 

Quick Side Bar: while our baby girl is our first born, we also have a 3 year old foster daughter who is currently on the track for adoption (by us). 

Now, here's how our newest and first bio-daughter wound up in the NICU:

My wife had been having a few slightly higher BP readings the few couple of weeks and an elevated protein/creatine ratio. The OBs weren't initially concerned about all that because it was closer but not to the level of preeclampsia yet. Then she started getting daily headaches and more feet/hand swelling than usual up to this point.

In subsequent appointments she had urine dips and they all came back negative for protein but the headaches and swelling would not go away. So at her MFM appt on Tuesday the 28th the doctor took one look at her and said right away he had a cure for her, labor and delivery. Baby was laying transverse and the cord was in front of the cervix, so he said she would need to have a cesarian, but he was going to defer to L&D so he sent us down to get checked out.

After 24 hours of trying to get her headache and blood pressure under control, to no avail, the OBs determined the safest thing would be to deliver. There wasn't any benefit to keeping baby in because with pre-e she wasn't going to thrive. After a few more hours of debate on induction vs cesarian -- because the cord may have moved? spoiler alert it didn't -- they finally took us in for the cesarian and our daughter was born at 2:41pm on the 29th. 

My wife got to see her briefly before they took baby to the NICU. Wife was then confined to her bed for 24hrs due to being on magnesium so I followed and stayed with baby girl for a bit until my wife was out of recovery.

**Now - on to baby and NICU the last few days**

Baby was 5lbs 4oz at birth which I was very surprised about. But then again, she was doing perfectly fine before the pre-e set in. All things considered she was doing very well at birth -- main troubles included torticollis, rapid respiratory rate, and jaundice (which was discovered today. She didn't get formula/milk until about 12 hours after birth, and did it via NG tube. She also got a TPN and lipids..which she is being weaned off of as her milk intake increases -- tonight she took 22mL via bottle when i fed her!  

She also came off of the heater yesterday and is in a regular bassinet. And they just took off her oxygen cannula today. 

I feel like she's progressing very quickly but at the same time she's still not totally great on the sucking thing and she's on the light therapy. 

My wife gets discharged on Sunday and it's going to be so tough to go home without our sweet little one but we need to go home to finish getting things ready...we thought we had at LEAST a few more weeks after all. I guess that's what we get for being unprepared.

The hospital is about 45 min away from home so the drive isn't too long but also feels like hours. 

Sorry to wrap this up so quickly, it's late here and I really should get some rest because I have to get up with my wife to pump in a couple hours. So feel free to ask any questions or share advice you may have. I gotta say, NICU nurses are fucking saints. I love them all.",29,6,2020-02-02,late delivery
