BabyBumps,Can we as moms stop shaming decisions around delivery?,"Today a woman asked when I was due. I told her I‚Äôm scheduled next Friday due to breech. She immediately gave me sad eyes and told me she‚Äôs had four vaginal. She then asked why we can‚Äôt just flip him. Then ended the convo with ‚Äúwell I would wish you a speedy labor but you just get to lay back and relax so enjoy!‚Äù and walked away. WTF. 

This past month I‚Äôve spent sulking because I wasn‚Äôt getting the birth experience I had always pictured. I felt like I was being robbed of some crucial part of motherhood. And in that moment I realized the reason I have these ideas around what birth needs to be is from other moms. Because moms want to share their birth story as a testament to their willingness to sacrifice for their babies. But instead of it leading to support it leads to judgment and one upping each other. What they forget is that we are all making sacrifices and all going through battle to get there. All moms are warriors. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you labor for 4 or 40 hours, whether it‚Äôs a c-section by choice or not by choice, whether you even carry your baby or not. If this woman had pushed a ten pound baby out with no medication during a full moon in the woods during a tribal ceremony that‚Äôs her choice but I truthfully could careless. 

We all are just trying to do our damn best for us and our families. Stop telling women how it ‚Äúshould‚Äù be done and just be supportive. End rant.

BabyBumps,So when people say vasectomies don't always work....,".... they ain't lying.

Shit guys.... just got a very faint line on a prego stick. We've got two little ones and because I am so so bad at pregnancy we decided no more and hubby got snipped. My period is a couple days late so I did a pee stick and it looks like we're having number 3 now. 

I'm excited and terrified. When I say bad at pregnancy I mean almost died both times with blood clots, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes just for the extra shits and giggles. So that part I'm not looking forward to at all, but I guess at least I know to expect the forthcoming hell. But then after... another tiny human to join our little family. So exciting. 

I told husband and he just looked at me and said ""shit... oh shiiiit..... but the *makes snip motion with fingers*??? Wow"". Then he went quiet for a bit whilst I jabbered about vasectomies so I asked if he was ok and he just said ""yeah I was just thinking of names"". Heart. Melted.

AskDocs,"My very smart Dad has recently started reading and believing all these ridiculous conspiracy theories regarding 5G, Coronavirus, and even one about Trump having a time machine. He‚Äôs a history teacher and extremely clever, and never believed things like this before seriously.","Is this just in alignment with the current issues of the world, or could something mentally be going on? 

Male/57/approx. 117kg (unknown height - fairly tall. I‚Äôm 180cm and he‚Äôs a bit taller than me)/ diabetes type 2, hypertension, some liver issues. On a bunch of meds. Unsure of names sorry. Lives in Australia. 

Just out of nowhere lately he‚Äôs reading and believing all these conspiracy theories - and some are so out there. He‚Äôs not getting a flu jab anymore because he thinks the government is gonna control us with it. When he talks about them, he seems normal, even does so with a sort of tone that implies he knows it‚Äôs a bit ridiculous, but he honestly really believes it. When he‚Äôs alone with my mum, I hear him talking about them more seriously. 

He‚Äôs a very clever man. Always got top marks in everything he‚Äôs done. Has a first degree in history (that‚Äôs like the best marks you can get on a degree in the UK), and a teaching degree. Could someone like this just suddenly start believing in conspiracy theories like this, is it a normal progression for some? Or could something else be going on?

Edited to add: 

I am sorry I haven‚Äôt responded. I am a bit overwhelmed at all the comments, and the responses. I‚Äôll try and cover some main responses in this comment.

1) I know history teacher doesn‚Äôt = smart. But I meant it when I said he‚Äôs smart. He has immense general knowledge, and could have done many things before choosing to be a teacher in his 40s. He worked in science labs as a younger man. I‚Äôm not bragging, just trying to demonstrate that he has the mental cognition skills and isn‚Äôt lacking, which makes this more perplexing to me. 

2) I asked my mum what she thought of this and she just laughed it off and said he‚Äôs ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù, but not in a concerned way. She is not very good at dealing with any emotions or deep issues and would never seriously address this, hence why I came here. 

3) He has always been an anxious person, not in contact with his family (we moved countries 12 years ago) and has mood issues. He used to be very angry growing up, but has actually mellowed the last few years. He‚Äôs still fairly mellowed now. He tends to have an obsessive personality, so maybe it‚Äôs just manifesting in this.

4) he doesn‚Äôt really have more time on his hands. In my country (Australia) and state, schools stayed open and he worked like usual. He‚Äôs just started school holidays for 2 weeks which may be leading to his increases searching, but this started when he had his usual routine. 

5) I‚Äôm not scared of him doing anything crazy (it‚Äôs crossed my mind, but I have anxiety issues too and think it‚Äôs just that), I‚Äôm just worried for him that this could be the start of mental health issues or Alzheimer‚Äôs or something. His mum is still alive. Dad died of diabetes complications over 15 year  ago I think.

6) he is on a bunch of medications, but no recent changes to them. But I guess the build up could be contributing.

7) he keeps back flipping quite a lot. One second he says covid is fake and just the flu and just being used to control us, the next second he tells me to be careful of covid when going out. And both times he seems just as serious.  Does this indicate its more or less likely to be an actual medical problem?

AskDocs,Wife becomes pregnant after having bother ovaries removed.,"27F, 165 lbs, 5'4"", no medications

My wife had a small (golf ball) ovarian cyst and one of her ovaries removed at 18 after it burst causing extreme pain and other complications.

 She had our daughter at 24 with a uneventful pregnancy, but ended up having a C section because labor would not progress. 

After the birth she believed she felt a hernia in her abdomen, and had a CT scan done to verify that was the case. They determined there was a hernia present, but another large cyst was discovered on the remaining ovary. We researched fertility preservation options over a year period and ended up deciding against all of it. She had her remaining ovary removed about a year after the cyst was discovered, that made her infertile around 26. Sad situation for our whole family at the time


Now my wife is about to turn 28  and a while back she had been feeling sick for a few weeks and decided to take a pregnancy test to get it out of her mind. Shes 22 weeks along and we are all (including the doctor that delivered our daughter and removed the remaining ovary) completely mystified. Nobody understands how my wife could be pregnant. I still have trouble grasping the idea myself.

The only explanation the OB could give is that either he or the doctor that removed the first ovary (different Doc) left a small piece of ovary behind unintentionally. 

We have been dating since she was sixteen and I was there for both surgeries. I heard both docs say that they were unable to save either Ovary. 

Has anyone ever heard of this? Is there any other possible explanation? Should my wife resume hormone replacement after the birth and possible breastfeeding period? She was on hormones before because she was considered to be menopausal. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I fell asleep and alot of questions got asked overnight. I answered them as best I could. Thank you all for your comments and questions and most of all congratulations! We are stoked to have one more and cant wait to meet her!",909,176,2020-01-18,week of birth,355,,,,,,,,,

Puffy hands and feet? Well that's totally normal, especially if you've had some salt or been on your feet a lot. Or iT CoULd bE PrE-EcLAmPsIa!!!

Headache? It's because of the extra weight, off-center balance, stress, and bad posture... *Or your blood pressure could be so high that your eyeballs are going to pop out of your skull!!!!*

Abdominal pain? It's just your round ligaments, gas, acid reflux, Braxton Hicks, or stretching skin. OR YOU MIGHT LITERALLY BE DYING!!!! OR IN LABOR!!!

AskDocs,How long can you be contagious if you have COVID-19? Could it be longer than 2 weeks if asymptomatic yet have come into contact with others who might have it ?,"Hello, 
 
First, I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses, and medical staff during this global crisis. You are the true warriors in this earthly fight. And I am constantly praying on your behalf. 


I am the mother of a 3 year old with spastic quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy and periventricular leukomalacia. My son has multiple chronic medical conditions such as chronic lung disease, neurological disorders, developmental delay, high aspiration risk, airway clearance impairment, etc. He was born at 24 weeks and was on ventilation for nearly three months in the NICU where we stayed for 151 days. To top it off, I have a history of pulmonary embolism and hypertension. 


I am trying my best to figure out how to help myself and my loved ones. I could not convince my boyfriend to stay home from work so he started staying at his parents house (staying 6ft away from them at all times if and when the rare times he does see them as they are at higher risk too) but now I am fearful of lockdowns and being separated from him during this madness, apart from that, the longer he stays there the more risk he has of infecting his elderly dad. So I am trying to protect both my son and his father. 

Thus, I‚Äôve blocked off a room in my home to quarantine him and observe his symptoms if any at all. (He has decided to stop going to work finally) But how long should he wait to come out of quarantine ? I can‚Äôt live with myself knowing I did not do all that I possibly could to protect my baby. 

He plays a vital role in my sons care and I don‚Äôt have anyone else. I am grateful for any advice. 

I have a medical background so please don‚Äôt hold back.",458,32,2020-03-20,NICU stay,307,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,Unexpectedly delivering alone: The COVID-19 birth story (crosspost from April2020bumpers - very positive),"My husband tested positive for COVID-19 so I called the hospital to be told they had a quarentined labour and delivery room and it would be no problem.  The next morning (28.03.2020) I went into labour. When I arrived at the hospital 6 hours into labour at 38+2 the hospital decided they had changed their minds and my husband could no longer join me after I had already left him in the car to go check in.

What you might be expecting is a sad and traumatic birth story but too be honest it was the most empowering thing I've ever done in my life. 

It took me about 3 or 4 hours of video calling my husband, parents and sister to calm down and accept that this baby was coming either way so I needed to come to terms with it. My labour progressed incredibly slowly and I had contractions  5 minutes apart from 7am until around 10pm on day one. At 10pm I was only 3cm dilated so was offered oxytocin to speed up contractions or mild pain relief so I could sleep and see how things progressed. My waters had broken at 10am and so I couldn't leave the hospital and was on regular antibiotics. I decided to let my body decide how things progressed and took some pain relief that allowed me to sleep until 12.30. I then dozed between contractions until 4.30am. 

At 4.30 I was still only 3cm dilated and was offered oxytocin again which I turned down. I managed to breathe through the contractions until 5.30am when I took another dose of pain relief and slept for another hour. These contractions were a real turning point for my mental and emotional state. I wanted my husband to rest so he could be with me for the big day to come and so I focused myself and worked through them alone. I allowed myself to see how strong and capable I really was. 

At 10am my contractions were steady and mild still but I had made it to 6cm dilated. The hospital had to give me oxytocin at this point as my waters had been broken for 24 hours. Over the next 4 hours my contractions became much stronger and more regular and I dilated to 8cm by about 3.30pm. I took one more dose of pain relief at 2.30pm - it was too mild to help the contentions but allowed me to feel calm in the breaks. Throughout the whole day my husband was on video call and talked me through contractions giving me words of support. 

At 4.30pm my contractions were very strong and I could no longer communicate much with my husband. I had short 1 minute breaks between them  but unfortunately was still only 9cm dilated. At this point my midwife and doctor strongly recommended that I took an epidural due to the length of my labour and the strength of the contractions (added to the fact that I was alone they were very worried I was going to become exhausted). I turned down the epidural and decided to power through. The final cm of dilation was incredibly painful, I was in a quarantined room and only had one midwife able to be present with me so when she had to leave me to prepare the room for birth I found dealing with these last contractions alone very difficult. I allowed the idea of giving up enter my head for 1 second before I banished it forever. 

It was finally time to push. A doctor put on protective gear and the three of us were locked away in our quarantined room with my husband on video call at the head of the bed. I had to push for around 30 minutes and required manual help for around 3 or 4 contractions from the doctor. Team green gained a little girl called Katalina Grace at 18.01. 

Unfortunately she had some difficulty breathing and a mild infection from my waters. She was whisked away before I could touch her and taken to the intermediate care ward which I wasn't allowed to access due to the quarantine. She weighed in at 7lbs 5.5oz and 50cm and during the night she recovered to full health. I am met her for the first time st 1pm the following day.

Don't get me wrong, giving birth alone was the last thing I thought I could cope with, and at times it seemed like I was facing an impossible task but to reassure any mamas out there that may be facing the same thing, you've got this.

BabyBumps,Unexpectedly delivering alone: The COVID-19 birth story (crosspost from April2020bumpers - very positive),"My husband tested positive for COVID-19 so I called the hospital to be told they had a quarentined labour and delivery room and it would be no problem.  The next morning (28.03.2020) I went into labour. When I arrived at the hospital 6 hours into labour at 38+2 the hospital decided they had changed their minds and my husband could no longer join me after I had already left him in the car to go check in.

What you might be expecting is a sad and traumatic birth story but too be honest it was the most empowering thing I've ever done in my life. 

It took me about 3 or 4 hours of video calling my husband, parents and sister to calm down and accept that this baby was coming either way so I needed to come to terms with it. My labour progressed incredibly slowly and I had contractions  5 minutes apart from 7am until around 10pm on day one. At 10pm I was only 3cm dilated so was offered oxytocin to speed up contractions or mild pain relief so I could sleep and see how things progressed. My waters had broken at 10am and so I couldn't leave the hospital and was on regular antibiotics. I decided to let my body decide how things progressed and took some pain relief that allowed me to sleep until 12.30. I then dozed between contractions until 4.30am. 

At 4.30 I was still only 3cm dilated and was offered oxytocin again which I turned down. I managed to breathe through the contractions until 5.30am when I took another dose of pain relief and slept for another hour. These contractions were a real turning point for my mental and emotional state. I wanted my husband to rest so he could be with me for the big day to come and so I focused myself and worked through them alone. I allowed myself to see how strong and capable I really was. 

At 10am my contractions were steady and mild still but I had made it to 6cm dilated. The hospital had to give me oxytocin at this point as my waters had been broken for 24 hours. Over the next 4 hours my contractions became much stronger and more regular and I dilated to 8cm by about 3.30pm. I took one more dose of pain relief at 2.30pm - it was too mild to help the contentions but allowed me to feel calm in the breaks. Throughout the whole day my husband was on video call and talked me through contractions giving me words of support. 

At 4.30pm my contractions were very strong and I could no longer communicate much with my husband. I had short 1 minute breaks between them  but unfortunately was still only 9cm dilated. At this point my midwife and doctor strongly recommended that I took an epidural due to the length of my labour and the strength of the contractions (added to the fact that I was alone they were very worried I was going to become exhausted). I turned down the epidural and decided to power through. The final cm of dilation was incredibly painful, I was in a quarantined room and only had one midwife able to be present with me so when she had to leave me to prepare the room for birth I found dealing with these last contractions alone very difficult. I allowed the idea of giving up enter my head for 1 second before I banished it forever. 

It was finally time to push. A doctor put on protective gear and the three of us were locked away in our quarantined room with my husband on video call at the head of the bed. I had to push for around 30 minutes and required manual help for around 3 or 4 contractions from the doctor. Team green gained a little girl called Katalina Grace at 18.01. 

Unfortunately she had some difficulty breathing and a mild infection from my waters. She was whisked away before I could touch her and taken to the intermediate care ward which I wasn't allowed to access due to the quarantine. She weighed in at 7lbs 5.5oz and 50cm and during the night she recovered to full health. I am met her for the first time st 1pm the following day.

Don't get me wrong, giving birth alone was the last thing I thought I could cope with, and at times it seemed like I was facing an impossible task but to reassure any mamas out there that may be facing the same thing, you've got this. You are strong and you are capable. I will never forget the strength I found within myself and  I have made my husband and family immeasurably proud; they are in awe of me. If I'm honest, I'm in awe of myself and I now know that I can conquer whatever life throws at me. Please get in touch with me if you are scared or end up in a similar position.

AskDocs,Does my Husband (31) have mental heal issues or is he a jerk?," 

So I have been having the hardest year of my life with my current husband with whom I have been with for a total of 7 years. We met in our mid twenties and generally had a pretty happy relationship. Things started to go south slowly in mid 2017 with the pressure of getting engaged, planning a wedding and dealing with our difficult and dysfunctional families. In addition we were also starting our careers, living in a HCOL area and generally figuring out adulthood. We are also two very different people who came to blows over many differences and were generally poor with conflict resolution.

We had our lows but would always find a way out and be happy again.

At the start of this year, however, things seem to slowly unravel. My husband suddenly started getting panic attacks this January. Seeing as he was someone who never had anxiety or panic attacks, he was very disturbed by this. He genuinely thought he was dying, and had breakdowns. I took him to the ER, and called the EMTs multiple times at 3 am as he would wake up in a panic saying he was dying. They all cleared him saying he was healthy.

Around March he went to a GP for a checkup who looked at his EKG, read it incorrectly and told him he was dying. Within 30 minutes he called my husband back and said actually he made an error and everything was normal. This seemed to have really spooked my husband to the core. After that for the next few weeks he thought he had heart troubles and would not listen to me as I tried to reason with him.

I finally had him visit a cardiologist who indeed confirmed his heart was fine. We then went back to his GP who said that my husband was suffering from extreme stress and anxiety and needed to be put on medication. She prescribed him 10 mg Lexapro. The Lexapro was a god sent in the sense that it finally erased his panic attacks and shortness of breath. Things seem to finally slowly calm down and go back to normal.

A few weeks on Lexapro I started to notice slight changes in his personality. Suddenly he was colder and more distant. The soft, warm sweetness of his personality was replaced by coldness and anger. Now that his panic attacks and anxiety were gone, suddenly everything else was wrong. He said he hated his job that he previously loved and excelled at. He said he was bored and wanted to quit to join the police academy or start his own business, His family and I cautioned him that he needed to not act suddenly and think things through. Anything we said that wasn't affirmative was met with resistance and anger.

He also started drinking heavily. While my husband has always liked to drink, his daily 2 glasses of wine have now turned into a bottle of wine per night. He also goes out with his friends and gets blasted drunk and parties and bar hops until 2- 3 am in the morning. When I tell him he needs to come home earlier, he gets mean and aggressive and tells me to stop being a fun killer!

Suddenly I am his enemy no.1. He seems to have re-written our entire story where everything about our relationship and marriage is wrong. He hates and resents me for the hurt I have caused him and says he feels trapped and caged. He screams at me, yells at me and has scary episodes. For example, if he comes home at 2 am after bar hopping and I say anything about him staying out too late, he will walk into the kitchen, grab a bottle of wine say he is getting out of here and go lock himself in our car!!

He has also started sexting and chatting and calling with random women from hook up apps. I discovered him receiving nudes from a woman a month ago. When I confronted him about it he screamed at me that he wanted a divorce and ran away to stay with his parents. Another time when I tried to confront him again he screamed at me, took his bottle of wine and locked himself out side in our car. When I tried to go outside and get him to come inside and stalk to me like a normal person, he screamed at me and drove off drunk into the night at 3 am. He did not return home until an hour later.

Recently I discovered that he has been having sex with hookers in hotel rooms. He has recently started not coming home or coming home late after work. He always stays at the office until 3- 4 am and sexts chats and sends nude selfies to random women based on what I have seen on his phone.

If he does come home, he will stay up till 3 am by himself watching a movie and drinking.

Occasionally he will seem to have a moment of clarity, apologize profusely and tell me he doesn't know what he is doing. He gets these extreme rushes of emotions and he cant seem to control himself. The rest of the time when I bring up that something isn't normal he says I am the enemy and he hates me and I need to leave him alone and throws a tantrum and runs away.

I am at my wits end. I do not know what is going on with him. He is an asshole or is he suffering from some mental health issue?

TLDR; My 31 year old husband has been acting increasingly erratic, aggressive, mean and is cheating on me. I don't know what to do as this all seems very out of character.",426,124,2019-09-12,emotional health,974,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Things I (a Dad) wish I had done before delivery day,"My wife and I are now 1 week on the other side with our little girl. There are so many things I wish I could go back and tell my ‚Äòlast month‚Äô self to do to prep for her arrival. Since I can‚Äôt do that, I‚Äôll share here in case they are useful to others (Dads or Moms). 

1. Shelves! - Nursing happens in many locations around the house and early on it can be an hour long process. As good partners should do, you will be bringing lots of supplies to your wife as she nurses - drinks, burp cloths, pillows, phones, remotes, ice packs, cold grapes from the fridge to put on the baby‚Äôs cheek to keep them awake (if it works, it works!)... So if I could go back I would put low shelves on every wall near a soft surface because chances are nursing‚Äôs I‚Äôll happen there. Those TV trays with legs that slide under couches would also be really helpful. 

2. Lights - As A good Dad, you‚Äôll be doing a lot of consoling which means pacing throughout the apartment until you can attempt the Mission Impossible - lay her down without waking her (or your wife) up. On night one I was pacing in the dark trying to turn in a light switch with my elbow because I was terrified to take both hands off my daughter. The next day I bought a bunch of low light motion nightlights for around the place and it made a huge difference. I also put a dimmer in the bedroom so that I could bring her to my wife for late nursing without blinding her awake. If you have LEDs, the Lutron dimmers let you set the range very low so it is very faint light. At 3 AM, it‚Äôs plenty. 

3. Stretching - maybe not a problem for younger Dads, but for the late 30s guys like me you might want to prep your body better than I did. Holding up 8 lbs for an hour with your arms fully frozen will hurt more and more. You will also constantly be deciding between your own comfort and the risk of waking the baby if you shift positions. (Spoiler - keeping the baby asleep will win)

4. Buy Tupperware - we have been lucky to have friends and family bring us a lot of food, usually in a big casserole dish. This is amazing except after a few days your fridge real estate will be taken up by big containers with a single serving left. So we have started to transfer things into Tupperware when we get them. 

5. Set up and practice nursing timing apps - Early on you may need to keep close track of when the baby eats and die how long. On a rested mind this sounds simple - just time with your phone and write it down. On only a few hours of sleep trying to help my wife log, I look back at my notes which make no sense whatsoever. It makes it really hard to say ‚Äúdid the baby eat enough today‚Äù.  We now use an app but needed to create accounts and link both our phones so the data would sync. (Again - simple task on a rested brain, rocket science on day #3 at home post birth).  Also helpful to do some timing dry runs. Your wife‚Äôs hands might be busy holding so you will need a system of her shouting ‚Äúleft breast done - clock the right!!‚Äù so you can log it while doing dishes/laundry/etc. We tried a few and like this one -

6. Get baby nail files now. Her hands will look like wolverines claws 2 days out of the womb. Then they like to take those claws and attack their face. We waited and then it took a while to wear them down. Now, I just do a few seconds each day.

BabyBumps,Had my baby after very stressful pregnancy!,"On Wednesday I was inducted at 38 weeks and had my wonderful baby Theodore at 1:12 am on Thursday, at 20"" long and 7 lbs 4 oz. 

My pregnancy was smooth sailing until around halfway through, in early-mid June I had an ob/gyn appointment and complained that I was very constipated and was starting to have pain because of it. I wasn't worried at this point and was told to take colace, which I did. About a week later I still hadn't pooped and started throwing up everything that I ate. I was taking so much colace, prune juice, fiber bisuits, tried two enemas, but nothing helped. I stopped being able to sleep because the pain was so bad. After 3 days of not holding down food I stopped being able to hold down any liquids either. I called my obgyn and was advised to go to the ER to be evaluated and get fluids. 

I went to the ER and was told the nausea and vomiting were just morning sickness (even though I hadn't had any in two months) and that constipation was normal in pregnancy, just take some colace. I was given fluids and released. The next day I was throwing up about every half hour, went back to the ER, was given more fluids and told I had hyperemisis gravidarum. I knew something was very wrong at this point but the ER doctor just brushed off all my concerns.

The next day, after being unable to hold down food for almost a week and liquids for 3 days, I started vomiting up brown smelly liquid about every 15 minutes. I knew there was nothing in my stomach and quickly google diagnosed myself as having fecal vomiting (stuff in the intestines backflowing into my stomach) and a bowel obstruction. My husband called the ob and the ob called ahead to the ER to tell them this was not normal and I needed to see a GI specialist. 

This time I was taken seriously and had an x-ray done, which showed I might have a bowel obstruction. Then a CT scan which showed I definitely had a bowel obstruction. The GI surgeon came to speak to me and told me the reason my intestines hadn't ruptured yet was because the fecal vomiting was relieving pressure on them, but the large intestine was stretched beyond repair and would need to be removed. If I didn't have surgery ASAP my intestines would end up rupturing, or dying as the blood flow was cut off in them because of the swelling. I would wake up from surgery with an ileostomy (similar to a colostomy). The anesthesia could induce labor in which case my baby at 21w6d would not survive. I'm already afraid of surgery and the surgeon had never operated on a pregnant woman before, so I was terrified heading into surgery but knew I would die without it. 

I was in surgery for 5 hours, and woke up to be told that the obstruction was caused by a large tumor. The ileostomy bag was very disheartening to me but I've since adjusted to it well enough. The cancer cells had started to spread outside the colon and onto the lymph nodes, and I would need treatment. It was the worst day of my life, it felt like my world was crashing down around me. The only good news was the baby made it through the surgery just fine. 

We didn't initially think I could do chemo during pregnancy, but after meeting with several maternal fetal medicine specialists it turns out chemo is fairly safe during pregnancy because the placenta does a pretty good job protecting the fetus. 

I completed 5 rounds of chemo during pregnancy (7 more to go) and had constant doctor's appointments to do non-stress tests and growth ultrasounds to make sure baby was doing well, all of which he did great on. My weight was a big concern since I'd been at my pre-pregnancy weight still and then lost 15 lbs during the time I wasn't eating and during hospitalization. It took me the rest of the pregnancy to gain that back. 

My doctors decided to induce me at 38 weeks to fit into my chemo schedule and make sure I didn't have to stop treatment for too long. I was eager to have my baby because I was so exhausted of dealing with late pregnancy, the chemo side effects, and working full time as well. 

So on Wednesday I went in to be induced, 16 hours after starting pitocin I delivered my beautiful baby boy. I had an epidural which was great, my first baby I went into labor on my own and it progressed so quickly I wasn't able to get an epidural and honestly thought this must feel like what dying from a gut wound feels like it was so painful. With the epidural I could still feel contractions but not pain which was great. It was very weird being basically temporarily paralyzed from the waist done though. When I was transferred from the labor to the recovery room I tried pulling myself onto the stretcher with my legs dragging behind me and my husband told me I looked like a dying animal. 

I'm not able to breastfeed because the chemo medicines/poisons transfer into the breastmilk but bottle feeding has been nice because my husband and I can take shifts at night staying up with the baby so I can actually have a decent stretch of sleep. We're so happy to have home with us after such a stressful pregnancy and he is such a cute little guy. My husband and daughter and I are all in love with him. :)

TL;DR: Had my baby Theodore after finding out halfway through pregnancy I needed my colon removed and would have an ostomy bag instead, and being diagnosed with cancer and starting chemo.",396,53,2019-10-22,stress during pregnancy,987,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,I want to get my uterus removed,"I'm a 23 year old woman and I've been suffering ever since I first got my period 11 years ago. Several gynecologists have suggested I have endometriosis but they never actually never tested me for it. I've been on the pill since I was 18 but it doesn't solve my uterine problems. It does take away the symptoms but I often experience paralysing cramps and heavy bleeding during my period. I once had a period that lasted 40 days.
Last cycle I decided to skip the pill and it was the worst cycle I have ever had. The ovulation was very painful and the pain faded very slowly. My period came a week early and lasted 5 days. Those days have been hell. The bleeding was extreme and the cramps made me throw up and have diarrhea at the same time for hours. I got sick when I stood up. My uterus felt as if it was filthy water balloon in my belly.
This reminded me I'll probably have to deal with this for 30 more years. I want to look into getting my uterus removed and don't feel like dying every month. I've never wanted any children so I donkt think I'd ever regret such a procedure.
The only thing holding me back is the fact that I'm very scared of getting surgery. Anaesthesia scares me a lot. I don't like the idea of people cutting into me.
On the other side my uterus disgust me and I get sick thinking about it.
I'm from Belgium so if I decide to get the procedure my insurance will cover the costs if tests prove the procedure is necessary to improve my health.

BabyBumps,"Birthed a 10 lb 4 oz babe two weeks ago. Positive, kind of crazy birth story.","Hello all! 

&#x200B;

So I'm going to preface this by saying I'm really effing proud of myself. The end of this pregnancy was cuh-ray-zee. 

&#x200B;

My story starts exactly two months ago, when my two year old heart warrior woke up looking puffy. After a local ER visit it was determined that she had fluid on her heart & we were transferred to children's hospital two hours from home. 

&#x200B;

We are still here üôÉ after a valve replacement, multiple set backs and a hell off a climb by my sweet girl to get back to health, we're finally just a couple days from discharge. üôå

&#x200B;

Since the hospital is 2 hours from home, my husband and I have lived in her hospital room this entire time. I surrendered my worry since I had no control over when I'd go into labor or how long we'd be stuck here. The last few weeks of my pregnancy I would just wake up every morning praying thank you that he wasn't born last night & repeat that when I'd go to bed. Hoping but not setting any expectations that we could be home before he was born. 

&#x200B;

Like the perfect child he is, he held on as long as he could and labor did not start until I was 41 weeks exactly. 

&#x200B;

I had an induction appointment scheduled for mid morning on February 28th but I woke up at around 3 AM and just felt off. I couldn't get comfortable and I woke up my husband and traded the recliner I usually sleep in for the couch but that didn't help. Then I tried climbing in my daughter's hospital bed with her but that didn't work either. Around 5 AM contractions started and were 10 minutes apart. The hospital I was delivering at was a 4 minute drive away. 

&#x200B;

Since I was at 4 cm at my last appointment and this is my 4th delivery, I decided to head out. 

&#x200B;

We had made the decision to have my husband drop me off at L&D and go back to my daughter. My Dad and Sister live nearby but are not fit to be support for the actual birth. My cousin offered to be there too, but after such a long time riding the out of control roller coaster with my daughter's hospital stay, the idea of doing it alone sounded really appealing to me. I'm not sure how to make that idea make sense, other than to say birthing babies is something that makes me feel very powerful and in control as I work with my body and baby. I craved a situation that I felt power in so strongly at that point that I wanted to be alone with it. 

&#x200B;

So I did üôÇ. I spent about an hour laboring in triage before they checked my cervix. Contractions were painful but manageable and the check revealed I was at 6 cm already. So I was sent to a delivery room and labored another hour before I got my epidural. That time was a little stressful because my contractions were ramping up in intensity and 2 minutes apart. I did not want to deliver without the epi. But I got it in time and tried to sleep. 

&#x200B;

About an hour later, I was woken up by intense pressure. All my other kids transitioned in one graceful motion when they were born and I recognized the feeling and knew it was showtime. I'd gone from 7cm and zero station to 10 cm head visible in that hour.

&#x200B;

The doctor took forever to come in and they asked me to not push and that was really hard. I could hear him talking to someone outside my room and wanted to yell for him to hurry the fuck up lol. 

&#x200B;

The nurse coached me through pausing to wait for a contraction to push to prevent tearing and I'm so glad she did. I pushed 4 times and was ready for the 5th and it felt verrrrry intense and I didn't feel like I could progress on that push like I had with the others. The nurses literally bent me in half, feet back by my ears and I was able to push him out on that push. 

&#x200B;

Cade Marcus weighed in at 10 lbs 4 oz with a 14.5 inch head lol. Huge. My other babies were all under 8 lbs. My nurse was right about the pushing, I didn't end up tearing which is a small miracle in my opinion. Haha.

&#x200B;

My family came after that and helped after I got to my recovery room. I had a rough go at first because when my epi was placed, the anesthesiologist unknowingly punctured the dural membrane in my spine and I ended up with a spinal migraine. The puncture caused cerebral fluid to leak through the hole and I had an excruciating headache unless I was laying flat on my back. 

&#x200B;

They did a weird procedure to fix it where they did a second epidural but injected my blood instead of medicine and my blood sealed the hole. Thankfully I got instant relief from it. I guess that complication only has a 1 in 1000 chance of happening. Lucky me. Lol. 

&#x200B;

We're doing our best in this situation as we wait for my daughter to be discharged. The hospital made an exception to the RSV precautions that are in place and allow the baby in my daughter's room with us. So he and I are here during the day and Ronald McDonald House at night and my husband is with my daughter's around the clock. 

&#x200B;

I'm so fucking proud of us both for not only surviving but remaining sane during this whole ordeal. Can't wait to be home! Thanks for reading üôÇ",381,30,2020-03-12,week of birth,980,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,"[25F] Can't execute multiple-step thinking. Can't verbally spell out words over 4-5 letters. Can't transcribe words when spoken to me if they are longer than 4-5 letters (i.e. a last name I‚Äôm supposed to input into a database.) Basically, minimal short-term memory. Possibly a learning disability?","Height: 5'4

Weight: 130

Gender: F

Race: White

Medications: none currently, most recent ones were risperidone and lamictal. Discontinued about six months ago due to lack of substantial results with no major emotional changes as a result.

Smoking status: vape often. About a juul pod a day.

Previous medical issues: mentioned below. Few different diagnoses over the years. ADHD first (childhood), then they added major depressive disorder (~2015). In 2018, they both got thrown out and replaced with Bipolar II. 

Duration of complaint: Always, really. I feel like it wasn't as bad in elementary school, or maybe it just wasn't something I was really bothered by/aware of. By middle/high school, it was definitely noticeable to me.

Complaint:

I consistently test above average academically. I hate even saying that, but it‚Äôs relevant to this concern. I learn easily, I understand easily, I remember LONG-term easily.

I cannot input a debit/credit card number recited to me into our work database if they don‚Äôt pause in between groups of numbers. I cannot record a last name or an unfamiliar word down if it isn‚Äôt spelled out to me both slowly and a few letters at a time. I absolutely CANNOT verbally spell, though spelling isn‚Äôt a problem at all when writing. I cannot visually interpret XYZ grids whatsoever, and I‚Äôm proficient at math. I also can‚Äôt do division or multiplication in my head. Addition/subtraction over two places is also incredibly difficult if any numbers need to be carried.

Essentially, any thinking process where I have to go past three, maybe four small steps at a time, I forget where I‚Äôm at entirely and have to start all over. It‚Äôs like my RAM is nearly non-existent. Everything I do on paper works out great because it can‚Äôt disappear- it‚Äôs permanently on the page. Anything requiring on-the-spot, short-term memory? Forget it... literally.

I have a childhood diagnosis of ADHD. Got diagnosed with major depressive disorder around 21. After a major depressive episode/suicidal issue a few years after that, my psychiatrist shifted my diagnosis/medication to bipolar II. This diagnostic shift was predicated on an event I described when I was 18, where after a traumatic life event (first major death of a loved one), I had a solid month of extremely erratic, reckless and very uncharacteristic behavior combined with a lack of sleep or need/desire for it. Fit every definition I've read of a manic episode, and the age was appropriate for symptoms to start. I haven't had one since, however. 

I stopped taking these bipolar medications around six months ago because they weren‚Äôt very effective for me in general and I felt they were making focusing on schoolwork even more difficult (caused me to feel lethargic, emotionally numb, sleepy, disinterested, etc. Common side effects.) I definitely have long-standing depression issues, but no present mania or hypomania. I occasionally get bursts of energy/feeling 'up'/overconfidence, but they usually last anywhere from 1-6 hours before they go away entirely. Never days at a time since that manic episode at 18.

I haven‚Äôt found anything that falls beneath the scope of either ADHD or bipolar to explain this. Doctors and my past mental health team sort of brushed it off in the face of treating my depression. I just want to know what this specifically is. It feels bigger than just the symptoms described. It‚Äôs like I can feel my brain hit some weird wall whenever I try to think steps or moves ahead.

Speaking of which, I‚Äôll throw in one last example. Cannot do strategy games like chess. I just lose my future plans two imagined steps in. They can‚Äôt be recalled; they just disappear.

BabyBumps,Positive birth story but the week after... Not so much. A bit of cautionary tale,"I'm finally ready to share my story. It's a bit tramautic. Just an FYI myself and baby are doing great but always listen to your gut. Sorry it's so long just putting it all out there in case it may help you! 
Before any of my pregnancy journey started I had heart surgery at 6 months old for a hole that wouldn't close but have been fine since. Fairly common surgery (as far as infant heart surgeries go)
So I want to start by saying my pregnancy and delivery went smoothly. Nothing out of the ordinary.  I had a bit of morning sickness, a bit of heartburn, baby was breech for 90 percent of the pregnancy but she did flip eventually, mild swelling (it was August and very hot) and no high blood pressure until the day before I was induced (the doctor didn't need me to rush over to the hospital but definitely wanted DD out the next day just in case as it was borderline high)
We went to the hospital and I delivered a healthy baby girl who is perfect. We went home and I had read (I believe on a post here) that once you're not pregnant all your symptoms go away. I was so excited for that.... Except I still had heart burn, and slowly every day my swelling was getting worse. I had bought compression socks to use during pregnancy (never did) that I put on because the swelling in my legs became so painful. My chest was hurting but I thought it was muscle strain from labor. I had a tiny cough that was constant ever since I delivered but everyone kept saying it'll go away.
We had been at home a week and because it was late August it was HOT. I however, was freezing I turned off the AC had fuzzy socks over my compression socks, sweats and a hoodie on. I also took one of DDs blankets and wrapped it around my head. I also couldn't stop dry coughing and had taken 3 showers that day because the steam helped. 
Finally it was 11 at night and I had basically a panic attack. I told my husband I thought I should go to the ER because what if it was a cough our baby could get? I mean we were just in a hospital and she was so little! Luckily, my parents could come and pick me up so DH could stay with baby. 
We went to the ER and I was admitted (the whole time anxious because I should just go home and be with my little family not at the ER for what I thought would be bronchitis.)  I was put on oxygen and sent to get a CT scan, because when the nurse had me walk across the hall to the bathroom my oxygen dropped from the low 90s to the mid 60s...
The ER doctor couldn't believe what he was seeing. My aorta was tearing and I had a leaking valve. He initially told me that they were going to take me by ambulance to a hospital in Denver (we live a little over 200 miles away from that city)  then it changed to they we're getting a Life flight ready and I'll be going into emergency heart surgery as soon as I get there...So call your husband but don't let my blood pressure raise I had to stay calm so my heart wouldn't implode.  My dad was awesomely calm and got to walk up to the helicopter pad with me. 
My mom went to be with my daughter (8 days old at that point) and my husband made the 2 hour journey to Denver. Luckily his mom and her husband drove him since he was a bit of a mess (putting it lightly) Thank goodness for family! 
I woke up after an almost 4 hour surgery with a new mechanical valve and lots of tubes. I spent 10 days in the ICU and 3 days in a regular room. My parents drove down with DD so my husband could go be with her in the hotel room a lot. Again it takes a village. I only saw her once there and it was when I got out of the ICU. We took a nap together! She was a great motivation to get better and get out. We now are about 6 months out and doing wonderful. She's so strong and sweet and patient with me while I learn how to be a mom to her while recovering and healing. 
All this to say that if you think something feels wrong even just a cough go to your doctor right away. I'm so so so glad for modern medicine because I wouldn't be here without it.

BabyBumps,I‚Äôm 34 weeks pregnant and my mother is grossed out by my ‚Äúfat‚Äù body.,"My mom is obsessed with being skinny. I‚Äôm quarantined with her. It‚Äôs hell. I had trouble standing up from lying flat on the tile floor after stretching and she calls me a fat pig. No she‚Äôs not being funny. Called me fatty when I was just sitting on the couch on my phone. 

I‚Äôm fucking pregnant. I‚Äôm over 34 weeks pregnant. I should have this belly. And I‚Äôm really proud of it. I‚Äôm not insecure about my weight. Yes, I do want to lose this extra weight as soon as I can after birth, but I‚Äôm okay with how I look. 

The whole point of this post is to rant I guess because it‚Äôs so fucking annoying. Just being around someone who sighs whenever they see you eat is fucking obnoxious. Now every time I look at her I know she thinks I‚Äôm ugly. I feel it. And I literally can‚Äôt do anything about it. I‚Äôm staying here until the baby can get some vaccinations and then my husband and I are moving out of state. I‚Äôm also having a really hard time figuring out when‚Äôs the safest time for us to move because of this, you know, global pandemic thing going on. I don‚Äôt even know how to handle this.

AskDocs,Vomiting for 10 months straight (Not pregnant),"Hello, I am 30, F, 190 lbs. I have been vomiting almost every single day since late January 2019. I don't feel sick or nauseous when the vomiting comes. It's very sudden and very violent. If I have an empty stomach it's yellow and green mucusy foam and a lot of it. It doesn't happen at certain times of the day, it's completely random. The longest I went without vomiting was 5 days, thought it would be over but nope.

My throat hasn't stopped feeling raw and my voice has been disappearing.

The first Doctor (at a clinic) I saw laughed at me, tried to convince me I was just pregnant and told me to go home and celebrate the pregnancy without even testing that. I can guarantee you I am not, unless you can get pregnant from breathing air. Did multiple pregnancy tests at a different clinic a few days later to confirm that I am in fact, not pregnant.

In the summer I stopped eating every meal and had chicken broth and pedialyte diet, nothing changed. It doesn't matter what I eat or don't eat.

My family Doctor did a blood test and physical check up. Everything seemed fine.

A few months later, I still complained and he requested a gallbladder ultrasound. He said if the office doesn't call me for a follow up appointment that it would be normal. I haven't heard from them so I guess it was.

I am a heavy cannabis user and read up about cannabis hyperemesis syndrome so I stopped that all summer as well. Nothing changed.

I haven't lost any weight, that would of been cool at least I'd get something out of it. I quit my job because my co-workers were complaining about my frequent bathroom trips, they could hear the violent vomiting and were completely grossed out the few times I didn't make it to the bathroom and grabbed the nearest trash can. I've been unemployed for 6 months now.

A few symptoms that have recently started for the past month, since early November, my stomach gets incredibly bloated, huge and hard (one side of my belly also sticks out further, not sure if that matters). It's also random, sometimes I notice it while I'm laying in bed trying to sleep, sometimes it doesn't happen at all, also not affected by food. I've also noticed a fever at night only quite frequently lately (but I also recently got lip filler and was told I could get fevers from that) I also noticed the left side of my stomach being very hot when I touch it and sometimes I notice discomfort (not pain, it just feels odd) left side under rib area.

Past diagnosis:PCOS as a teen.Endometriosis in my 20's.Prolactinoma as a teen. Was going to have it surgically removed however a few days before surgery the surgeon called me and said he normally doesn't remove them if they're not bigger than 6mm and mine was like 5.9mm or something and he said removing it was unnecessary. Have routine MRI's every year, most recent MRI (2017) showed there wasn't even a prolactinoma anymore so there was no routine MRI in 2018.

Someone please help me I am miserable. Today I had Asian slaw for lunch (without meat and fish sauce) felt completely fine, paid, went to my car, got in my car, felt it coming and threw the car door open and left the salad in the parking lot. I don't want to eat or live anymore.

Also, I was born premature. I never went to doctor or seek for medical attention because my family don't have enough money. Despite of my condition, I am an honor student of a public high school. When we have our Physical Education class, I never experience to participate and join thembut instead, I just stare at them and feel insecure.On the other hand, I am grateful that I am here, given a chance to live.

AskDocs,"24F, feeling very sick after accidentally inhaling a lot of fumes from rotten potatoes. Could I have solanine poisoning?","24F, 5‚Äô6, 111 pounds, Caucasian, never smoked, almost never drink, no recreational drugs, located in Charleston, SC. History of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type III along with a number of comorbidities, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal issues. More details on medical history at end of post.

There has been a smell coming from my pantry for the last several days that I haven‚Äôt been able to identify. Today, I opened the door and just got hit with this wall of fumes, and I decided enough was enough. I spent about half an hour tearing it apart and smelling every single thing in it. By the time I identified the potatoes and threw them out, I was feeling pretty terrible. My head kills, I‚Äôm super nauseous, and I‚Äôm having chest pains.

I looked it up online and read that rotten potato fumes can be extremely toxic, but it‚Äôs hard to tell if I‚Äôm feeling awful because of toxins or because the smell and activity triggered flares of my pre-existing conditions (see below). It‚Äôs not uncommon for me to experience chest pains just from walking around the kitchen for a while, and I have a headache and nausea for the better part of most days as it is. It feels worse than normal, but not so much worse that it couldn‚Äôt be a heightened version of the regular stuff.

That being said, I have been experiencing some other unexplained symptoms over the last few weeks that I wonder might have been caused by inhaling the fumes before they were as noticeable. I‚Äôve been experiencing random spikes in temperature (99.6-100) that last for about 12-18 hours, go away, and then pop back up again a few days later. I‚Äôve also lost weight (from 122 to 111 in less than a month) with no changes in diet, and I‚Äôve had pretty bad diarrhea and abdominal pain too (mostly upper right, but it kinda moves around). I‚Äôve also had really bad dry eyes and dry mouth. (My rheumatologist has suspected Sjogren‚Äôs for a while and ordered a lip biopsy recently, so that‚Äôs happening soon.) I also have had a sore throat (kinda burns, probably related to dry mouth) and swollen glands.

I have an unrelated diagnostic laparoscopy scheduled for next month, and they‚Äôre going to test me for covid before that. I don‚Äôt think I have covid, and neither does my doctor. Mostly because the fever has been so off-and-on, and I‚Äôve had no cough at all. But I‚Äôll be tested in the next few weeks regardless.

I just don‚Äôt know how to tell whether the worsened symptoms I‚Äôm experiencing should be worrying me or not. I sent a message to my doctor, but the office doesn‚Äôt open for several hours, and she probably won‚Äôt see my message until the end of the work day anyway (that‚Äôs the time of day she usually sends me messages). If there‚Äôs a chance I‚Äôm experiencing poisoning, what steps should I take to manage it until I hear from my doctor?

Health issues: EDS (type III), POTS, mitral valve prolapse, MCAS, pernicious anemia, gastroparesis, IBD, GERD, interstitial cystitis, idiopathic hypersomnolence, small fiber neuropathy, cervical instability, scoliosis, kyphosis, tortuous colon, vestibular adenitis (two past surgeries for this), and unexplained eosinophilia (pending hematology referral). Suspected esophageal dysmotility (doctor wanted to do a manometry, but I declined because it sounds awful, so this is unconfirmed). Suspected endometriosis (pending laparoscopy). Suspected Sjogren‚Äôs (pending lip biopsy).

Meds:

Ditropan (10 mg/day), Metoprolol (75 mg/day), Nexium (80 mg/day), Sunosi (150 mg/day), B12 (1000 mg/day), Nexplanon birth control implant

I have had no recent changes in meds apart from my cardiologist upping my metoprolol from 50 to 75 mg/day because I‚Äôve been dealing with shortness of breath, presyncope, and chest pains more often than normal lately due to inactivity (thanks, quarantine).

BabyBumps,Blighted Ovum - A warning story,"Disclaimer: I wanted to write this to provide information to women experiencing a diagnosis of a blighted ovum, but this is not intended to provide false hope. You have done nothing wrong with any steps that you take. Please advocate for your own health, an obtain second (or third!) opinions if you feel that it will provide you the information that you need to make the best medical decisions.


I‚Äôm not even sure if this is the correct place to post this, but when I initially received the diagnosis of a blighted ovum I was looking for actual stories and found only medical information. I don‚Äôt know, I guess I was looking for some understanding.

My husband and I have been TTC for 8.5 long years (we have one 9 year old, who was a surprise) and in that time period we only had one CP very early on. I tracked dutifully for 8 years, kept a running list of baby names on my phone, and emotionally struggled as all of my fertile-Myrtle friends and SILs had baby after baby. In December, I essentially decided that I was done. I had always wanted to adopt anyway, so we turned our focus to adoption in January. We filed our paperwork, took our online classes, and waited. In February, I made an off-hand joke to my husband that I was late - I‚Äôm always late. He responded that I should take a test, and on a whim I used the last test we had under the sink (which was actually expired). I glanced at it briefly, expecting to see a singular line as always, but this time there were two very solid lines. I immediately broke down crying in the bathroom, where my husband joined me when he saw the test. He rushed out and bought a few more, all of which solidly said that I was pregnant.

I pushed to get into our OB/GYN early, terrified it was going to be another CP. we met with our Dr. (who was actually our Dr. for our first child!) and he confirmed the pregnancy via test but was unable to locate an embryo via TV ultrasound. He estimated that I was approximately 6 weeks along, and said that the following week should show an embryo.

We returned the following week to a different OB, who had been by Dr. during several fertility screenings. She also conducted a TV ultrasound but noted that while she saw the gestational sac, it was empty. She diagnosed me with a blighted ovum, and began discussion my three options - Natural, Medical, or D&C. I was heartbroken, but chose to continue naturally and a D&C if it hadn‚Äôt started in several weeks. 

I was fairly useless in the following days, and hardly wanted to leave the couch. I took a few days from work, giving my boss minimal details. I still felt pregnant, but the OB has explained that my body was still emitting hormones that gave me the typical symptoms.

On February 25th we went in for a final ultrasound with our hospital‚Äôs radiology department to confirm the diagnosis. I watched as our technician conducted an ultrasound, and noted that her face didn‚Äôt change. She then switches to a TV ultrasound, and I closed my eyes hoping the time would pass more quickly. After a few moments though she turned the screen around and said ‚Äúcongratulations, you‚Äôre pregnant‚Äù. I saw our tiny embryo on the screen, measuring at only 6w4d. I saw it‚Äôs heart fluttering, and instantly burst out crying. I don‚Äôt think I will ever experience that level of emotion again. Our tech was wiping her eyes, and explained that this rarely happens (she had never experienced it herself before) but that somehow I was measuring much further behind than what my tracking would indicate.

We followed up this week with another TV ultrasound and were able to hear our baby‚Äôs heartbeat and see expected growth. My HCG levels aren‚Äôt right on par with where they should be, and I was told by the midwife that this is now a considered a viable pregnancy.

I wrote this wall of text for a few reasons. For starters, I really needed to get it out of my system and record it somewhere. And while I don‚Äôt want to give false hope to other women experiencing the same diagnosis, I felt so relieved that I hadn‚Äôt chosen to immediately terminate the pregnancy via medicine or D&C. I didn‚Äôt have even the slightest ounce of hope, but I wanted to wait and see what my body did naturally. A friend (who is an L&D RN) explained later that the tracking at the beginning is always a bit wonky, and that if my OB was looking for a 7w embryo she obviously wouldn‚Äôt have found it. If this can give even one woman some guidance, it will be worth it.",265,65,2020-03-10,emotional health,819,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,I am less stressed out and feel more myself post-partum than during pregnancy.,"I worried about this constantly while pregnant so I figured I'd post here because I know there are others who feel now the way I felt. 

I'm 8 days out. Context: I had an easy pregnancy, physically. Emotionally, it was the hardest experience of my life. Wondering if baby would be ok (found out late at 17 weeks) shotgun wedding, personal and interpersonal upheaval.

The amount of stress and fog I felt during pregnancy overwhelmed every part of me and I worried constantly that this was the new norm and going downhill when baby arrived. Between work and endless preparation for baby, I had no time for myself (I live or die on having it).

But I've been less tired (sleep about as much), have more time (worked till day of labor now on unpaid leave), and less interpersonal stress (everyone is about baby now with a shared goal). I also have my autonomy back over my body in a significant way. I physically feel more myself and the constant mental exhaustion that I know you know was lifted after getting back home.

BabyBumps,I am less stressed out and feel more myself post-partum than during pregnancy.,"I worried about this constantly while pregnant so I figured I'd post here because I know there are others who feel now the way I felt. 

I'm 8 days out. Context: I had an easy pregnancy, physically. Emotionally, it was the hardest experience of my life. Wondering if baby would be ok (found out late at 17 weeks) shotgun wedding, personal and interpersonal upheaval.

The amount of stress and fog I felt during pregnancy overwhelmed every part of me and I worried constantly that this was the new norm and going downhill when baby arrived. Between work and endless preparation for baby, I had no time for myself (I live or die on having it).

But I've been less tired (sleep about as much), have more time (worked till day of labor now on unpaid leave), and less interpersonal stress (everyone is about baby now with a shared goal). I also have my autonomy back over my body in a significant way. I physically feel more myself and the constant mental exhaustion that I know you know was lifted after getting back home. I'm still physically recovering but things are already better.

So basically, for anyone out there as scared as I was - it might be ok on the other side. You might... and probably will! feel better. So soon. Hang in there. Pregnancy does not last forever.

BabyBumps,For the first time in my life I truly never wanted to be a different person or in a different situation to the exact one I‚Äôm in now,"I‚Äôve never been particularly keen on myself. Like most people there‚Äôs things I hate. There‚Äôs things I like about my life too, but that‚Äôs mostly the people. The things I like about my life are external to me.

I‚Äôm disabled and in so much physical pain all the time. I live in a crappy home we got stuck with. I‚Äôve got a job 2+ hours away after years of shitty jobs that ruined my mental and physical health. I‚Äôve always hated my figure and how I look. I hate aspects of my personality and my limitations. I hate some of the experiences I‚Äôve had that broke my heart or left me with trauma. I even tried to kill myself when I was 16 and only really stayed alive after that because I knew it would be too upsetting for the people I love. 

But, on Wednesday, I got my 20 week scan. I‚Äôm giving my husband a son. And he‚Äôs huge! Top 10% for size. He‚Äôs cheeky too. I‚Äôve been getting kicked and punched something fierce since about week 16. During each scan he‚Äôs been upside down with his bum in the air and wriggling around, making it hard to get the scans done properly. Last time I had to jump around, shake my hips, the sonographer was practically slapping my belly and eventually tilted the bed upside down so she could get the profile done. And by that point he wouldn‚Äôt stop yawning so she still couldn‚Äôt get the picture. Whole thing took 45 minutes. My mother was with me and couldn‚Äôt stop laughing and crying. 

Me and my husband suffered a really traumatic loss last year and it nearly killed me. I mean physically nearly killed me. I developed PTSD from the surgery involved. We‚Äôve been emotionally distant (as best we can be) this whole pregnancy so far to protect ourselves from more hurt. On top of that I have a condition that causes complications and difficulties in pregnancy. But our baby is so perfectly healthy it‚Äôs like all the excitement we‚Äôve not allowed ourselves to feel the last 4 months has caught up with us and won‚Äôt let go. 

When I was talking to my brother (who‚Äôs also my best friend) later after the scan I went to make a self-deprecating joke as I always do and stopped myself. I couldn‚Äôt do it. Saying anything negative about myself was in turn saying something  negative about my son. For the first time in my life I was so completely contented with exactly who I am because it has led me to my wonderful, unruly son in my belly. And to me that‚Äôs the most incredible thing ever. To know it‚Äôs my son growing and developing inside me. My son I‚Äôve imagined for years and years now. The son I‚Äôve dreamt of, who‚Äôs name I decided a long time ago, the son I sometimes never thought I‚Äôd have, but in my heart always knew I would. Knowing he exists and is growing inside me has made every trauma and heartbreak and second of ungodly pain completely worth it. I‚Äôm crying as I type this. I‚Äôve never loved myself. But now I do, because inside me is my son, who I love more than anything else. I‚Äôve got so much love for him in my belly it‚Äôs spilling out into the rest of me. I love me, because I love my son.

BabyBumps,"Hamish Boaz, a (positive) birth story at 32+5","Our beautiful son, Hamish Boaz Jackson, was born this morning at 32 weeks 5 days, weighing 4 pounds 3 ounces and measuring 17"" long. He was breathing on his own at birth thanks to the steroid shots that were administered for his lungs and so far only needs minimal oxygen support and an NG tube because he hasn't mastered the suck/swallow/breathe mechanism. 

The birth story: 
I was admitted to the hospital in preterm labor earlier this week. At this time they discovered that I had masses on my ovary and one kidney, eventually diagnosed as stage 3 ovarian cancer. There was some discussion of when and how treatment would begin, whether to have a caesarean section and try to remove some of the cancer then, etc. 

On Monday morning the oncologist asked for another PET scan to determine where the cancer had spread in totality (ie, where there may be cancer cells but not enough to create visible tumors), and expressed his urgency. 

The oncologist, obstetrician, and my midwife that I've been with my whole pregnancy met with my husband and I on Monday afternoon and we discussed our options. It is extremely unlikely that I will be able to have another baby after this, so we discussed everything and they made it clear that they wanted to respect my wishes and my husband's wishes as much as possible. I asked if there was any possible way I could be induced and experience labour and delivery as naturally as possible. They all consulted together and came back and let us know that they thought that Hamish could handle it. After that everything happened remarkably quickly. 

After an NST, I was given something to prepare my cervix and hooked up to Pitocin. It took a couple of hours for everything to get going, I remember in the beginning I was laughing and joking about how this was going to be a piece of cake. By about 11:30 at night though I was experiencing intense contractions and even though the idea was to go drug free I ended up asking for nitrous oxide, which was actually amazing. I was relaxed again and able to focus on my goal and not my fears. 

At 1:30 this morning I was fully dilated and ready to push. Because of his size it only took 3 pushes and he came out! I had planned to switch to my hands and knees when it was time to push and the midwife and my husband were helping me to get there when I felt his head, I remember saying ""oh, no, nope"" and trying to push him back in with my hand, but luckily they stopped that. 

I had expected that his birth would be a somewhat sterile and medical experience given everything and had expressed my disappointment in this, and I feel like everyone tried to make it as serene, peaceful, and not ""cold"" as possible. When baby came out they let me hold him and he started crying, my husband also got to hold him for a short time. They took him up to the NICU after about 15 minutes down with us, but honestly, I was exhausted and I just told my husband ""I'm going to sleep now"" and did. Haha. 

When I woke up we were able to go up and see him. I expressed that I wanted to walk around as soon as possible and so I walked up to see him. They had him wrapped up in a cute little candy cane stripes blanket with a santa hat on his head and I cried. 

I'm back to my room now resting. My husband is on his way with some Church's chicken and beer (my requests). Most likely my PET scan will be on Thursday and we will figure out how to proceed from there.

We decided to name him Hamish Boaz; Boaz meaning ""in him is strength"". We wanted a name connotating strength and decided to go biblical in honor of his birth date. 

I need to ask my husband if sharing a photo of him  would be okay, but for now, know that he is the sweetest thing we've ever seen and I am so in love. 

There's many fears and unknowns for our family right now but I feel that I had a fantastic birth and I have a beautiful son and I couldn't ask for more.",169,14,2019-12-25,preterm birth,737,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,The Flu Shot Email,"I'm writing up an email to send out to family members and close friends to remind them to get their flu shot since the season is starting soon. I didn't think I'd be doing this 5 years ago, but 5 years ago my MIL wasn't anti-vaxx so here we are. Would love any feedback or critiques! Thank you!  


 *Hi all!* 

*I hope you're as excited for the holidays as I am!* 

*I'm sending out an email at the request of my doctor as flu season is beginning. If you're planning on seeing me over the holidays, please get your flu shot. Pregnant people are much more susceptible to contagions because our immune system has lowered in order to accept the baby. If I catch the flu while pregnant, it can lead to dehydration, miscarriage, preterm labor, or (in extreme cases) maternal death. The flu may also cause birth or congenital defects in the baby.* 

*If you are uncomfortable with getting the flu shot, please let me know so that we don't put the baby at risk. We can schedule a video call instead!*

*Thank you for joining me in keeping my first baby as safe as possible!*

AskDocs,Help me get over my vaccine hesitancy. (Be kind),"When my daughter had her 2 month shots (DTAP-IPV-HIB, and prevnar) years ago, she had a bad reaction. I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere. And I dont think our healthcare staff handled it appropriately looking back. She had a high pitched wail for hours on end between deep deep sleeps, labored breathing, fever, and was very lethargic (no eye contact) and wouldnt feed well. The nurse said I was being a worried first time mother, over the phone and said she was fine. I literally watched her 24/7 until about 3 days later she started to come around. In my reading I found that DTAP can be a little harder than prevnar or MenC vaccines, so at the next visit I skipped DTAP and did those. She did not even react to those 2 vaccines. After this I just stopped. (I know I know) 

Before all this happened I was very pro-vaccine. I used to be a quality control chemist for a pharmaceutical manufacturer and even dabbled in R&D. Let me also add that I am very auto-immune. To the point of almost dying twice. I have also had rare reactions to medications like drug induced lupus to remicade and anaphylaxis to codeine. I am allergic to several medications and antibiotics. Big pharma products have hurt me, but they have also saved my life. Being in and out of hospitals I have seen the good and the bad in the healthcare system. Currently I am in 100% remission thanks to stelara. 

And I have never been sure of my decision to stop shots and I have been relying on herd immunity while I figure it out. I want to protect her, but I also fear that she will become autoimmune.

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25277820](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25277820) 

All this said I have made an appointment to have her first shot in years and she will be getting MMRV at the age of 12. If all goes well I will restart her DTAP-IPV series. The nurse was very kind and helpful and even angry for how I was treated. She says she understands my fear and will go at my own pace.

BabyBumps,They forgot to notify me about my induction date... surprise!,"So I went into my 39 week appt yesterday afternoon and was almost too late to make it thanks to a delivery truck blocking the exit of my apartment complex and other fun traffic mishaps. I called and they said you have to be here by 4 for the doc to see you. I got in at 4:02 and sat my swollen ass down like dont even play me right now I'm full term and seeing my doctor, idc!!

The doctor walks in and says ""you're so close! You can see the light at the end of the tunnel huh?"" And I'm like ehh can I? She says ""since your inducing on Sunday night, please call 2 hours ahead..."" she trails off after noticing the look of panic on me and my husband's faces and realizes we had no idea about this induction which has been scheduled for a week now!

They forgot to send me a notice about the induction date. I've been panicked everyday waiting for labor as my docs were all in agreement that if I wanted to have a natural labor, it needed to happen within the 40 week mark.

Well we have less than 2 days to prepare and come to terms with the impending reality that I'm going to have a likely long labor in the hospital and will not be laboring at home. The good news is I progressed to 3 cm and 50% effaced. She did a membrane sweep to speed things along.

The funny thing is I would have missed my own induction if they didnt let me see the doc because I was 10 minutes late for the appt.

NICUParents,Update PPROM at 22+4 with di/di twins (warning: loss),"Original post: https://reddit.com/r/NICUParents/comments/dtltvr/pprom_at_224_with_didi_twins/

My wife‚Äôs water broke on Friday November 8th and we were discharged with instructions to monitor for any signs of infection or labor or any changes in discharge. 

On Saturday we had a nervous day of laying in bed and watching lots of Scrubs. Late in the afternoon my wife noticed some shooting abdominal pain and dull lower back pain so we called the perinatal doctor we spoke to the day before and she recommended we take a trip to the hospital to be evaluated. We had a nervous trip down to the hospital and were hooked to the monitor and the nurse was able to find both heartbeats and we were immediately relieved. They took an ultrasound and everything looked ok, in fact baby A appeared to have accumulated some fluid since the day before which was a good sign. We were discharged again but felt like we might be ok. 

On Monday morning my wife woke up to a pink discharge which we called in to L&D and they told us to come in for another evaluation. This time our drive to the hospital was less nervous and more scared. We were hooked to the monitor and they searched for baby A‚Äôs heart for a few minutes without luck. They pinned down baby B and went back to searching for baby A. A few more minutes and another nurse came in to try. Our hearts were falling but we still didn‚Äôt know for sure. When the doctor came in with the ultrasound she found baby A and her heart was still. A second doctor came in to confirm the diagnosis. One of our twins had died in the womb. 

Monday we were 23 weeks exactly and we were admitted. The hospital has a Level 3 NICU so we were where we needed to be. At this point my wife still had no signs of preterm labor. No contractions. We were counseled by neonatology about outcomes for babies born at 23 weeks in case my wife went into labor or in case they needed to do an emergency c-section. After having just lost baby A, we were willing to do anything to keep baby B and opted to agree to all resuscitative measures in case they were needed. 

My wife began on the antibiotics and received her first round of steroids. We were absolutely crushed by the loss of baby A. My wife lost her father earlier this year and it has felt like a series of losses have struck us in a row. We spent our first night in the hospital scared for baby B and mourning the loss of baby A. The course of action at this point was to keep monitoring for signs of infection, keep tabs on mom‚Äôs and baby‚Äôs vitals, and watch for any symptoms of labor. 

We woke up early Tuesday morning to cramps that felt like period cramps. We knew that at this gestational age contractions can be fairly light so we got hooked back into the monitor and my wife was given Tylenol and iv fluids. The cramps subsided. 

In the morning we celebrated being pregnant another day. My wife had a bowel movement and noticed something protruding from her vagina, it was baby A‚Äôs foot. My wife had an unmedicated vaginal delivery of baby A without contractions or labor. Baby B stayed inside. We got to hold our baby girl and give her a name. We got to say goodbye. We named her Chioma. My wife was a rockstar but I crumbled holding her tiny body. They sutured the umbilical cord as close to the cervix as possible and noted that the cervix had closed after delivery. 

Since then it has been back to the waiting game. Grieving for Chioma. Grieving the unfulfilled plans and dreams of raising twin little girls. But also celebrating the life still within my wife. Hopeful but terrified. Today marks 24 weeks and 6 days. Every day is a gift and every day improves baby B‚Äôs chances.

We have good days and bad. We have a lot of visitors, we have used redbox more in the last two weeks then the last two years. 

It‚Äôs a very strange emotional mix, the sadness, the anger, the happiness, the fear. It‚Äôs very strange that the best outcome at this point is a long protracted hospital stay followed by a short NICU stay for Baby B. 

Thank you for the support we received when I first posted about the membrane rupture. This is an amazing and supportive community. Our nurses and our doctors have been incredible and have provided excellent care. 

We‚Äôre still here, counting days and hoping and praying for positive outcomes.",76,10,2019-11-25,preterm labor,788,,,,,,,,,

On Saturday we had a nervous day of laying in bed and watching lots of Scrubs. Late in the afternoon my wife noticed some shooting abdominal pain and dull lower back pain so we called the perinatal doctor we spoke to the day before and she recommended we take a trip to the hospital to be evaluated. We had a nervous trip down to the hospital and were hooked to the monitor and the nurse was able to find both heartbeats and we were immediately relieved. They took an ultrasound and everything looked ok, in fact baby A appeared to have accumulated some fluid since the day before which was a good sign. We were discharged again but felt like we might be ok. 

On Monday morning my wife woke up to a pink discharge which we called in to L&D and they told us to come in for another evaluation. This time our drive to the hospital was less nervous and more scared. We were hooked to the monitor and they searched for baby A‚Äôs heart for a few minutes without luck. They pinned down baby B and went back to searching for baby A. A few more minutes and another nurse came in to try. Our hearts were falling but we still didn‚Äôt know for sure. When the doctor came in with the ultrasound she found baby A and her heart was still. A second doctor came in to confirm the diagnosis. One of our twins had died in the womb. 

Monday we were 23 weeks exactly and we were admitted. The hospital has a Level 3 NICU so we were where we needed to be. At this point my wife still had no signs of preterm labor. No contractions. We were counseled by neonatology about outcomes for babies born at 23 weeks in case my wife went into labor or in case they needed to do an emergency c-section. After having just lost baby A, we were willing to do anything to keep baby B and opted to agree to all resuscitative measures in case they were needed. 

My wife began on the antibiotics and received her first round of steroids. We were absolutely crushed by the loss of baby A. My wife lost her father earlier this year and it has felt like a series of losses have struck us in a row. We spent our first night in the hospital scared for baby B and mourning the loss of baby A. The course of action at this point was to keep monitoring for signs of infection, keep tabs on mom‚Äôs and baby‚Äôs vitals, and watch for any symptoms of labor. 

We woke up early Tuesday morning to cramps that felt like period cramps. We knew that at this gestational age contractions can be fairly light so we got hooked back into the monitor and my wife was given Tylenol and iv fluids. The cramps subsided. 

In the morning we celebrated being pregnant another day. My wife had a bowel movement and noticed something protruding from her vagina, it was baby A‚Äôs foot. My wife had an unmedicated vaginal delivery of baby A without contractions or labor. Baby B stayed inside. We got to hold our baby girl and give her a name. We got to say goodbye. We named her Chioma. My wife was a rockstar but I crumbled holding her tiny body. They sutured the umbilical cord as close to the cervix as possible and noted that the cervix had closed after delivery. 

Since then it has been back to the waiting game. Grieving for Chioma. Grieving the unfulfilled plans and dreams of raising twin little girls. But also celebrating the life still within my wife. Hopeful but terrified. Today marks 24 weeks and 6 days. Every day is a gift and every day improves baby B‚Äôs chances.

We have good days and bad. We have a lot of visitors, we have used redbox more in the last two weeks then the last two years. 

It‚Äôs a very strange emotional mix, the sadness, the anger, the happiness, the fear. It‚Äôs very strange that the best outcome at this point is a long protracted hospital stay followed by a short NICU stay for Baby B. 

Thank you for the support we received when I first posted about the membrane rupture. This is an amazing and supportive community. Our nurses and our doctors have been incredible and have provided excellent care. 

We‚Äôre still here, counting days and hoping and praying for positive outcomes.",74,10,2019-11-25,early labor,788,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,Better living though chemistry- being open t medication for depression and anxiety during pregnancy.,"Hi,  I just wanted to share this since I'm seeing so many other posts about depression and anxiety during pregnancy.  My psychiatrist actually told me that 1 in 5 mothers experience it.

I have been on prozac for years and xanex as needed. I was on 30mg of prozac when I got pregnant.  I took the xanex (.25mg) around 4 times a year.  Before getting pregnant,  my OB said it was OK to stay on the prozac. 

I desperately wanted to get pregnant. I work with children and had dreamed of being a mother my whole life. My husband and I went through 2 painful years of trying to conceive,  and I was over the moon when my second cycle of IUI worked. 

Around 5 weeks,  something changed.  I felt sicker than I had in my life.  I cried constantly.  I stayed in bed shaking from panic attacks. Xanex was a no go for pregnancy but I took it once after spending the night thinking about killing myself. I asked my husband to disassemble our gun.  I hoped that I would miscarry and hated myself. Within days of feeling like this,  I went to my psychiatrist and told him everything I was feeling. He upped my dosage to 40mg but when I told him about my thoughts, he said, ""you dont really mean that. "" He reminded me to feel lucky to be having a baby and to stay positive. 

A week later,  my husband was close to committing me to a psychiatric ward.  He took off of work and I would literary cling to him and cry when he left the room.

Luckily,  after my husband yelled at my psychiatrist,  we managed to get a referral to a maternal psychiatrist. My husband flipped out when he read the referral letter that said. ""ISureDoLoveCheese is so excited to be pregnant and is very happy but wants somebody who specializes in women's issues."" My husband is incredible. He made countless phone calls, and was incredibly firm and I had an appointment in 2 days.

I spent my appointment dry heaving and crying and told my new doctor everything.  And my God, she was amazing.  She didn't treat me like a human incubator.  She didn't make me feel like a terrible person. After explaining costs and benefits of meds vs anxiety attacks, she upped my prozac to 60mg, put me on zofran, and told me to take  .5mg of Ativan until the higher dosage kicked in, and then as needed  

I only needed to take the Ativan for 3 days and have not needed to since. I'm currently 26 weeks and expecting a son, who I fell in love with as soon as i saw his face on the ultrasound. 

Within THREE DAYS, I was ok again.  I was laughing. I was back at work.  I still felt sick but it didn't scare me anymore.  I was having sex again.  I was eating.  I was me. 

I'm still dealing with guilt for my thoughts during 6 to 7 weeks, but I'm otherwise ok. I'm scared of postpartum depression,  but I've been able to share those fears with a kind,  compassionate doctor who assures me that I will be closely monitored and medicated. 

I'm still scared of having a panic attack during labor, but finally have medical professionals who take that fear seriously. 

All it took was 3 days to be myself again. I love my job. My husband and I still stay up too late because we can't stop talking to each other and laughing. We went on a babymoon and I'm looking forward to my shower. My son is looking healthy and active.  

PLEASE be open to medication and push for your mental health. Please message me if you need help. 

And if somebody could reassure me about labor and postpartum,  that would be great!",74,12,2019-12-19,pregnancy anxiety,644,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,My precipitous premature birth story,"My little lady was born 4/11 at 2:50am at 34+5 weeks. As a background other than a few weeks of somewhat mild morning sickness the first few weeks, my pregnancy was a breeze. Until the last week.  So starting Monday of the last week i started to have off & on back pains. It was sporadic & didn't hurt at all in the front, so of course I tried to justify it as anything other than labor. I thought maybe it was spasms, maybe I was constipated, some days it hurt, other days i was totally fine. Then Friday rolled around. So for a few hours Friday morning I was having timeable conractions. They were about 10 mins apart, irregular, not super painful, & I was working so I was still able to talk through them. Since I work from home I was able to take a hot shower & they all but stopped in the afternoon. By Friday night I felt better than I had all week. I had no pain at all. By midnight I was laying in bed & sometime around 12:15 the contractions started again. They were instantly about a min long & 5 mins apart. Around 12:35 my water broke. At this point i was going back & forth from my bed to the toilet. I already had a pad on, so when my water broke i thought well either my water broke or I lost all control of my bladder, since the pad was soaked through. And that's exactly what I went to tell my husband. Lol. So after that my contractions got way worse. I was a moaning screaming mess. At 12:55 I called the doctor's office. My husband convinced me to start packing a bag. (Looking back I was definitely in denial of how far along I was.)  My husband told me later that I got so bad that he wasn't sure whether to pull up the car, or put down a towel in the bathroom. So, we get a call from the dr & head in. At this point I can barely sit & I'm screaming like a crazy person. I know during 1 contaction I screamed ""Omg I'm not going to make it!"" So, I get checked into triage at 1:35. Since my husband couldn't come up yet I could barely get changed & the nurse had to help with some of it. The dr comes in & checks me & told me I'm fully dialated. To which I thought there's no f-ing way. So as I'm being rolled to the delivery room i call my husband to get up here & i ask the nurse for an epidural or something, to which she said, ""oh sweetie, there's no time for that.""  So i get to the room & they tell me to push. I never felt the urge to push, which is probably good b/c idk where she would have been born if I had. So initially pushing felt good compared to screaming during contractions. But then the ring of fire hit & it took me a long time to make more progress. I finally pushed her out at 2:50. I didn't have any tearing & just 1 hemroid. She was 4 lbs 3 ozs. There was a whole NICU team that was waiting for her. They examed her & I was able to hold her for about 30 secs before they took her to the NICU. My recovery was great, my throat hurt worse than anything for the 1st day.  

My little nugget is still in the NICU, but she's doing well.  I wanted to add that you really don't need to bring anything to the hospital other than a phone charger & maybe a pair of sweatpants. I didn't bring any toiletries, but they gave me all that stuff.i wore my gown & my PJ pants I wore to the hospital the whole time.",73,6,2020-04-24,prematurity,657,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,"Birth story: Zachary, born 36 w 5 d. Epidural, vacuum-assisted, overall positive. 19 hours of labor, almost 5 hours pushing.","I really appreciated reading all the stories that other people were willing to share so I figured it's my turn to ""pay it forward."" Happy to answer any questions for anyone.

Around 6 pm on Thursday 2/27 (36w4d) I was sitting on the couch putting on my shoes to do an exercise video on youtube.¬† I‚Äôd been pretty active prepregnancy and tried to continue that during pregnancy but I definitely slowed down toward the end.¬† After I put on one shoe I felt a gush of fluid and told my husband that I thought I might‚Äôve peed! I went to put a pad on (with one shoe on!) and sure enough, fluid kept coming out.¬† It was very slightly tinged with blood. We called the L&D advice line and they said if I thought my water broke I should come in to get checked out. We wrapped up some stuff around the house and got to the hospital around 7pm.¬† I sat on a towel in the car and by the time we got to the hospital the towel was pretty soaked. The on-call obstetrician checked me and confirmed that my water had broken and said I was 3cm dilated and baby was at -3 station.

They moved me to a delivery room and the waiting began.¬† Contractions began to really ramp up and around 11:30pm I asked for an epidural.¬† I was 4cm dilated at that time. After the epidural, I was able to sleep for about 2.5 hours in total.¬† Around 4 am I woke up and I couldn‚Äôt hear baby‚Äôs heartbeat on the monitor but it turned out he‚Äôd moved down so the monitor just needed to be repositioned -- all was fine.¬†

The nurse checked me and said I was fully dilated and it was almost time to push.¬† I didn‚Äôt start pushing until 8:10 am. I wasn‚Äôt sure if having a mirror to see my pushing would freak me out but I actually found it really interesting and it gave me something to focus on.¬† I pushed and pushed, on my back and on each side, and felt like I was making no progress but the nurse assured me that he was indeed moving down the birth canal. A few hours in, they said baby‚Äôs heartrate was dropping during contractions so I had to wear an oxygen mask between contractions.¬† I had a button I could use to give myself an extra ‚Äúpush‚Äù of epidural. WIthout the extra ‚Äúpush‚Äù I could accurately tell the nurses when a contraction was coming before the monitor detected it. With the extra ‚Äúpush‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt feel it at all and had to rely on them to tell me based on the monitor.¬†¬†

After about 3.5 hours of pushing I was exhausted and basically had a meltdown.¬† At that point there were a couple of nurses and a midwife in the room and without question they seamlessly cleaned up and left the room to give me a break.¬† When they came back 20 minutes later I was ready to keep pushing. The obstetrician suggested I get some pitocin to help intensify the contractions and I agreed.¬† She also asked if we‚Äôd consider a vacuum-assisted delivery and we agreed. The problem was that baby‚Äôs head was sideways and not fitting past my pubic bone. The vacuum lost suction and popped off one time, but finally at 1:24 pm, after almost five hours of pushing, he was born!¬† Despite being over three weeks early, he weighed a hefty 7 lb 11 oz. We‚Äôd actually just had a routine checkup four days before he was born and based on that ultrasound he was only a bit over 6 lbs. I can‚Äôt imagine if he‚Äôd waited until full term to make his appearance!¬†¬†¬†

Because he was premature they wanted NICU staff in the room when he was born so there were probably 8-10 medical staff in the room when he was actually born.¬† They put him on my stomach and vigorously rubbed him to make him cry, then quickly took him to a warming bed to check him more thoroughly. After only a few minutes the NICU staff left which was a really good sign -- he was healthy! I had no external tears, only small internal tears that needed three stitches in total.¬†After a few hours we moved to a recovery room.¬† We stayed for two nights after his birth because he was premature, but he was healthy enough that he stayed in the room with us the entire time.¬†

The recovery has not been as bad as I thought it would be. Maybe I hyped the whole thing up in my head. As of now, a week postpartum, my pain is greatly reduced and I can walk and get up and down from sitting and laying positions easily.¬† Breastfeeding has gotten easier as we have both learned how to work together. I‚Äôm only about 10 lbs above my prepregnancy weight now. As of my last pregnancy weigh-in, I‚Äôd gained about 36 pounds (but that was when I was admitted when my water broke, weighed with clothes, sweater, and shoes, so I suspect it might‚Äôve been less).¬† I‚Äôve had no negative effects from the epidural. My husband has been super supportive -- I feel really pampered at home. In retrospect I actually wonder if I should‚Äôve seen warning signs that he was coming early. For the week before his arrival I started feeling a huge increase in pelvic pressure and discomfort when walking. The day my water broke I was going to run an errand on the way home from work but I had this overwhelming feeling of needing to get home, so I skipped the errand.¬† Who knows!¬†¬†

I didn't have any tearing & just 1 hemroid. She was 4 lbs 3 ozs. There was a whole NICU team that was waiting for her. They examed her & I was able to hold her for about 30 secs before they took her to the NICU. My recovery was great, my throat hurt worse than anything for the 1st day.  

My little nugget is still in the NICU, but she's doing well.  I wanted to add that you really don't need to bring anything to the hospital other than a phone charger & maybe a pair of sweatpants. I didn't bring any toiletries, but they gave me all that stuff.i wore my gown & my PJ pants I wore to the hospital the whole time.",71,6,2020-04-24,premature birth,657,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,Update PPROM at 22+4 with di/di twins (warning: loss),"Original post: https://reddit.com/r/NICUParents/comments/dtltvr/pprom_at_224_with_didi_twins/

My wife‚Äôs water broke on Friday November 8th and we were discharged with instructions to monitor for any signs of infection or labor or any changes in discharge. 

On Saturday we had a nervous day of laying in bed and watching lots of Scrubs. Late in the afternoon my wife noticed some shooting abdominal pain and dull lower back pain so we called the perinatal doctor we spoke to the day before and she recommended we take a trip to the hospital to be evaluated. We had a nervous trip down to the hospital and were hooked to the monitor and the nurse was able to find both heartbeats and we were immediately relieved. They took an ultrasound and everything looked ok, in fact baby A appeared to have accumulated some fluid since the day before which was a good sign. We were discharged again but felt like we might be ok. 

On Monday morning my wife woke up to a pink discharge which we called in to L&D and they told us to come in for another evaluation. This time our drive to the hospital was less nervous and more scared. We were hooked to the monitor and they searched for baby A‚Äôs heart for a few minutes without luck. They pinned down baby B and went back to searching for baby A. A few more minutes and another nurse came in to try. Our hearts were falling but we still didn‚Äôt know for sure. When the doctor came in with the ultrasound she found baby A and her heart was still. A second doctor came in to confirm the diagnosis. One of our twins had died in the womb. 

Monday we were 23 weeks exactly and we were admitted. The hospital has a Level 3 NICU so we were where we needed to be. At this point my wife still had no signs of preterm labor. No contractions. We were counseled by neonatology about outcomes for babies born at 23 weeks in case my wife went into labor or in case they needed to do an emergency c-section. After having just lost baby A, we were willing to do anything to keep baby B and opted to agree to all resuscitative measures in case they were needed. 

My wife began on the antibiotics and received her first round of steroids. We were absolutely crushed by the loss of baby A. My wife lost her father earlier this year and it has felt like a series of losses have struck us in a row. We spent our first night in the hospital scared for baby B and mourning the loss of baby A. The course of action at this point was to keep monitoring for signs of infection, keep tabs on mom‚Äôs and baby‚Äôs vitals, and watch for any symptoms of labor. 

We woke up early Tuesday morning to cramps that felt like period cramps. We knew that at this gestational age contractions can be fairly light so we got hooked back into the monitor and my wife was given Tylenol and iv fluids. The cramps subsided. 

In the morning we celebrated being pregnant another day. My wife had a bowel movement and noticed something protruding from her vagina, it was baby A‚Äôs foot. My wife had an unmedicated vaginal delivery of baby A without contractions or labor. Baby B stayed inside. We got to hold our baby girl and give her a name. We got to say goodbye. We named her Chioma. My wife was a rockstar but I crumbled holding her tiny body. They sutured the umbilical cord as close to the cervix as possible and noted that the cervix had closed after delivery. 

Since then it has been back to the waiting game. Grieving for Chioma. Grieving the unfulfilled plans and dreams of raising twin little girls. But also celebrating the life still within my wife. Hopeful but terrified. Today marks 24 weeks and 6 days. Every day is a gift and every day improves baby B‚Äôs chances.

We have good days and bad. We have a lot of visitors, we have used redbox more in the last two weeks then the last two years. 

It‚Äôs a very strange emotional mix, the sadness, the anger, the happiness, the fear. It‚Äôs very strange that the best outcome at this point is a long protracted hospital stay followed by a short NICU stay for Baby B. 

Thank you for the support we received when I first posted about the membrane rupture. This is an amazing and supportive community. Our nurses and our doctors have been incredible and have provided excellent care. 

We‚Äôre still here, counting days and hoping and praying for positive outcomes.",71,10,2019-11-25,late delivery,788,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Anyone else having a baby without your mom?,"My mom passed away two years ago pretty suddenly during the first year of my marriage. My daughter is due the first week of December and lately I'm just feeling kinda lost without my mom. It also doesn't help that this will be the first grandchild on my side of the family which means my sisters can't really offer much baby advice either. I'm so grateful for my MIL and how she's been supportive but sometimes she can come off a little strong. Tbh I think I might be a little bitter because she's not *my* mom. Their personalities are just so different, sometimes I just wish I had my mom's perspective on things. And with all the ways my body has been changing, it really sucks not being able to ask her what her experience was like or what I should expect from my own pregnancy. Don't get me wrong, thankfully I have a great support system from my mom's sisters, my own sisters and dad, as well as a few close friends with young children that have been able to offer advice and guidance. But I don't know, it's just not the same as having your mom with you, you know?

I guess I want to hear about others' experiences with this? How do you cope with pregnancy without your mom? Raising a child? How do I keep my mom's memory alive when my daughter gets here? I want to make sure she knows about her grandmother. I just miss my mom, and I'm afraid it's going to get worse the closer I get to my due date and probably after.",68,66,2019-10-24,coping during pregnancy,273,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,Happy Birthday Update: PPROM at 22+4 with di/di twins (warning: loss),"Brief overview of what brought us here. My wife was pregnant with spontaneous di/di twins, due March 9, 2020. On November 8, Twin A/Chioma's water broke. On November 11, we went into the hospital for an evaluation and found out that her heart had stopped. Her sister, Kelenna, was still alive with intact membranes. My wife was admitted and on November 12, delivered Chioma naturally. During our hospital stay we were receiving NSTs three times a day. I'm a bit fuzzy on when the first significant decel happened, but it was around the weekend of December 7. We were put on constant monitoring with the hope that it was an isolated incident and we could go back to three times daily if we had a clean trace until the next morning. Instead we began almost a week of constant monitoring and late night decels that Kelenna always recovered from, but had the perinatal team asking when she would decel and not recover that would necessitate an emergency c-section. (Kelenna was breach throughout this period.)

Early in the morning of December 12, we had multiple decels including at least one that necessitated my wife to be put on NPO and to start on magnesium. Our resident came by during rounds and told me I should not go in to work that day. When the perinatologist came in, she highly recommended that we move forward with an urgent scheduled, but not emergency c-section. We cried over the decision but ultimately agreed that this was our daughter telling us that she was ready to make her grand entrance and that we should listen to our doctors. She would be born at 27+3 gestational age; a month to the day that her twin sister was born. The c-section was scheduled for 10 AM and our daughter was born at 10:30.

We heard her crying before we saw her during the ""drive-by"" on her way to the isolette. The NICU team stabilized her and she scored an 8 on the Apgar at 5 minutes. 

In the intervening weeks, my wife has recovered from her surgery remarkably well. She was discharged 5 days after delivery, but if we hadn't spent the last month in L&D it probably would have been sooner. We got into the housing for family members with loved ones in the hospital which has been absolutely huge for helping us adjust to our new life as NICU parents.

Kelenna is doing great, she is taking full feeds and gaining weight, she's been on bubble CPAP of 4-5 since day 4 or so. I'm convinced NICU life is harder on us the parents than it is on her. In addition to the stress of having a loved one in the hospital for the foreseeable future, we have also been grieving over multiple losses. Of her sister's life of course, but also of our chance to be parents of twins. Of getting to see her grow up with a twin sister, to see how they were the same and how they were different. We are also grieving the loss of a normal third trimester and having a baby in the hospital.

My heart swells with joy every time I see her, and it breaks every time we have to leave.

We've been doing normal parent things, changing diapers, taking temperatures and giving baths. Waking up twice a night to pump, and being exhausted throughout the day. Mama loves the skin to skin; she bradied twice on me my first time holding her, so I'm waiting until she's a little more stable to do it again.

Thanks again to /r/NICUParents for the support and for helping me know what was in store for us when they finally told us this baby was ready.",67,9,2019-12-31,gestational age,627,,,,,,,,,

I have been able to keep my cool, keeping mom in sound mind, reassuring everything is alright because i honestly do believe that. Mom is tired, she is sleeping alot, even now as i type. I went to check on our daughter in the NICU for the first time alone and after like a minute lost my collective mind. Tears, snot, choking up, repeat. It was hard but i want to be there.

The baby weighed two pounds when he was born, was addicted to painkillers. Basically a miracle the kid survived. 
He is now a year old. He cannot crawl, roll over or sit up by himself. She said he does physical therapy once a week. He is also very skinny. We only saw her give him rice milk and water all day, no solids. His arms and legs are thin and you can feel his ribs when he lays down. Head disproportionately large compared to his body. He is basically an oversized newborn. Some family members privately expressed concern that he is malnourished.

NICUParents,24 weeker turns 2,"I am posting this to give hope to those that are in a situation similar to what we were. My wife had a flawless pregnancy, then at 24 weeks she went into labor. My girl had an infected placenta so the twins came early, neither was over 1.5 lbs. I spent many hours on this sub looking for stories of miracles.

I had such dreams for my life with twins. When they were born so early it all felt like it was crashing down. I had more hope when their brain scans came back clear, all we wanted was for them to be as healthy as possible. Then at 10 days old our son became ill and died hours later. For those of you going through this, I am so sorry, the pain never stops. We miss our boy every day.

My girl continued to get stronger, she had some ups and downs but after 117 days in the NICU we took her home. We were so scared! I can‚Äôt believe they just let us leave, I felt so unprepared. She spent the first 3 months on constant low flow oxygen, it was cumbersome but fine. I tripped over an oxygen tube in the middle of the night while holding her and landed on my back by kept holding her in the air, I was bruised but she was fine. After that we did nine months of oxygen as needed.

Now here is the good part. At 2 years old she is beyond our wildest dreams. She is the sweetest, most fun, Intelligent baby you would ever meet. Her doctors marvel at how well she is doing. She is our miracle. I hope yours is too.

Tip: Our NICU did kangaroo care, it‚Äôs the real deal, look up the studies. Also at 29 weeks or so they let us pick her up on our own without help and my wife basically never put her down, she was being cuddled and loved on for 16 hours a day, I think this helped her.",62,6,2020-04-14,early labor,342,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,Giving birth alone?,"I‚Äôm almost 37 weeks. I‚Äôve been in an emotionally abusive relationship throughout my entire pregnancy. It‚Äôs super good at times but every once and a while when he loses his temper it gets way out of control. He‚Äôs called me fat cow (at 7 months pregnant), ugly bitch, stupid bitch, idiot, cunt, waste of life, he‚Äôll say he doesn‚Äôt love me anymore and I never meant anything to him, he tells me he wishes I‚Äôd kill myself (while pregnant with his daughter). I‚Äôm starting to believe all of it and I‚Äôm feeling so scared and unable to leave. He blocks my number constantly when I try to bring anything up, even when I‚Äôm in the hospital experiencing different complications and in so much pain he says it‚Äôs good I‚Äôm in pain and I deserve it. He says I deserve a miserable life and he will do whatever he can to make it that way. He tells me that he‚Äôs gonna have my baby taken from me and that he can‚Äôt wait to take me to court. I am not on drugs, I am living healthy and devoted my whole life to getting ready for baby, I don‚Äôt understand why this is happening.

He has spit in my face and then when I‚Äôm sitting there wiping it off crying says ‚Äúprove I did it, bitch.‚Äù He‚Äôs grabbed my arms to the point I have bruises and had to go to the hospital where I ended up having a sprained wrist and they documented injury (8 months pregnant).

Recently he told me multiple times that he hopes I die while I‚Äôm in labor. I really feel so scared and alone and I don‚Äôt get why this is the pregnancy I deserve. I love him so much and I don‚Äôt understand how he says he loves me and treats me like such shit. My water has broken once early and I was in preterm labour in the hospital and he wouldn‚Äôt come and said he hopes I die there. I had blood come out and contractions all night about two nights ago and he said good he hopes I‚Äôm in a lot of pain. I want to involve him so bad because when he‚Äôs not mad he‚Äôs a good person but I don‚Äôt know what to do or if I can even do this alone.

BabyBumps,Quick reflection on giving birth at 34+5: Baby in NICU,"This isn't a full birth story because I have slept about 4 hours in 36 hours, but I just needed somewhere to word dump and process some of what has happened in the past few days.

Well at 34 weeks and 4 days, body went into labor and despite all interventions could not stop that labor. I had my baby boy yesterday at 4:17 pm. He is currently in the NICU because his lungs are not fully developed at his gestational age. Luckily, he was still 6 lbs 2 oz and has a decent layer of fat on him. He's only on 6 L hi flow nasal cannula, but oxygen looks great. I'm hoping for a speedy discharge, but nicu can be one step forward 2 steps back.

This is my second baby and my first had an easy delivery, easy recovery, and my baby and I bonded instantly. This round was hard, they let me hold him for about 30 seconds after pushing him out (thank goodness he was breathing okay and not in distress).  Then they had to whisk him away to nicu to get him settled with oxygen, a feeding tube, some IVs etc. Well I started to have a bit if a breakdown once I got to my room. A tiny tiny old room in the hospital. I don't get to be in a larger nicer room because I don't have a bassinet and I don't have my baby with me because he is in the nicu. I finally got to visit and hold him at 10:30 pm. After that I could finally get a little bit of sleep until the postpartum cramps settled in. Those things are no joke, especially for round 2. I hate pain meds but took a percocet because it was so bad. Walking around helps too. FTMs, just be aware of those cramps, they hurt.

I feel lost with having my baby in the nicu. Luckily, he is late preterm and those babies do well usually and only have a 1-3 week stay, but things can always go wrong. I also miss my first born and my dogs. I want to go home because my main job now is to just pump. Then I feel like a bad mom because I should want to stay here, near my new little guy. What I hope is that tomorrow morning will bring some clarity and peace to the situation. I know this will just be a blip in his whole life and will not effect our bonding,  but it sure does feel like it now at 4 am after not sleeping for days. 

I am grateful for the OB that was on call during my entire labor process. I delivered 40 minutes before she was off call and she had just come on call when I was in triage. She discussed how normal it is for moms to have increased depression and anxiety with having a baby in nicu and not getting to go home with them. I'm also grateful for the nurses that took care of me and the ones taking care of my baby right now. 

Sorry for the rambling post. I just needed to word dump somewhere to help process.",58,22,2020-02-08,preterm birth,564,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,"22 weeks preterm labor, in the hospital on strict bedrest, hoping I stay pregnant for at least another few weeks. Any advice, please?","I posted this on r/babybump and someone suggested I repost it here. 

Sorry if this is not well written. I had a bad reaction to  an ambien last night and they had to give me something to calm down.

I went to my obgyn with a back ache and my stomach feeling tense. They did an ultrasound and found my cervix had thinned to a .5 (should be 4cm) she immediately sends me to her husband, a high risk doctor in the hopes he could put in a purse stitch to keep it closed.

By the time they got me in for anther ultrasound there an hour later I had dialated 3-4 centimeters and had a bulging bag.

They called an ambulance to take me to the nearest hospital with a level 3 nicu because we decided we want to do everything everything possible to save his life short of chest compressions (which can cause brain bleeding) and emergency c section, at least until week 24.

Right now my goal is to reach week 24 so he can get steroids to help develop him lungs but I'm afraid I won't make it. We are just trying to take it day by day. 

We started on labor and delivery and it seemed like it would be ok. The nurses were all amazing and so helpful even though I had to pee like 30  a day because of the iv and they had to come help me use the bed pan.

But now I'm in antepartum because they believe labor isn't eminent and it seems like they just don't care very much here. I feel like I'm very much on my own now.

I will start magnesium if I begin having regular contractions, but right now I'm just on antibiotics. (and colace, and bean-o). 

I'm on strict bedrest. It's horrible and uncomfortable and I have to use a bedpan. Does anybody have any advice to be more comfortable, more calm, how I can help my baby grow strong quickly, and especially how I can stop from going into official labor? Or anything else. I feel like shit for having this crappy body that can't do anything right. It took us nine years to get pregnant. I'm not sure if I will survive if I lose this baby.",56,49,2020-02-16,preterm labor,385,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,MFM made some really messed up comments and I am still raging,"I have insulin dependent GD and have had twice weekly BPPs, once with my OB and once with my MFM, since 32 weeks. I‚Äôm 34+6 today. I‚Äôve also had a hellishly difficult pregnancy. You can check my history for more details but long story short: horrible HG since the start, GD diagnosed at 20 weeks that has been difficult to control, irritable uterus, polyhydramnios, pinched nerves leading to constant back and arm pain and numbness, 2 cholestasis scares, etc. At this point at almost 35 weeks, I am in so much pain all the time that I can‚Äôt even stand to make my 2 year old son a snack without almost crying, but I also can‚Äôt sit comfortably. I‚Äôm on 138 units of long acting insulin spread across 3 shots a day, a Zofran pump, correction insulin for highs. 

My baby has been measuring large, especially her abdomen. I have 32cm of fluid. I‚Äôve been crying all the time, because this shitshow pregnancy is making me depressed. My psychiatrist agrees it‚Äôs the pregnancy and the only real remedy is to deliver. ACOG guidelines for poorly controlled GD are delivery late preterm to early term - so 34-38 weeks. I‚Äôm currently scheduled for 38 weeks but decided to broach the topic of moving delivery to 37 weeks with MFM today. 

She declined to move it forward. Which, fine, okay, I was disappointed obviously and I started crying. But then the fucked up comments came. First she said she wouldn‚Äôt do it because even though 99% of 37 weekers are fine, if my baby isn‚Äôt I will sue her. She also constantly referred to me wanting to be delivered now which isn‚Äôt what I was asking for and told me I‚Äôd have a baby with a lot of issues. 

The two most enraging comments though were these: 
‚ÄúYou already have one autistic child (my 2 year old son is autistic), do you want another one?‚Äù (Wtf early term birth doesn‚Äôt cause autism and my son is amazing fuck you) 
‚Äú‚ÄòMaybe baby will have another bad BPP and we will have to deliver before then.‚Äù (So basically ‚Äúhey maybe baby will go into distress and we will have to deliver her to prevent her from dying!‚Äù)

I‚Äôve told my bumper group (I‚Äôm still in the one from my son) and they all think I need to file a complaint. Every time I think about the conversation I start crying from rage. I have to see an MFM for the remainder of the pregnancy but I don‚Äôt want to see her again. I emailed my OB to ask about being moved to a different provider for the remainder.",55,19,2020-02-14,preterm birth,444,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,A year ago today I was admitted to to the hospital,"A year ago today I went in for my 34-week checkup and wasn't allowed to go home.  I'd come down with asymptomatic preeclampsia. A couple days  spent doing the steroid treatment for our baby's lungs and then I was induced.  I don't remember a good portion of being in labor due to the drugs I was on.  My epidural failed due to leakage out my back.  I blew at least 3 IVs.  When I held my child for the first time I was scared because I was so out of my mind on the medications and I felt drunk.  We spent a few minutes together before being separated for 36 hours, she to the NICU and I to mandatory bedrest.  We were fortunate to only spend about 9 relatively uncomplicated days in NICU with the growers.  

A year later my nearly one year old is a smiley, healthy, too smart for her own good, little chunk of joy.  She's been in physical therapy for some gross motor delays, but she's a little bulldog who is so clearly determined to catch up.  It's hard to remember taking home a baby smaller than dolls I'd owned.  A year later, despite the gratitude I have for her and my wellbeing, I'm still feeling a tinge of grief though for having been plucked from my ""before baby"" life before I was ready.  I thought in that last month I'd do ""one last"" so many things.    

Not sure why I'm posting this here except it feels like the only place where I might find other people who know how I feel.      If you are in the thick of your NICU stay right now, know there's lots of joy on the other side, and you are capable of raising this tiny little creature and coming out okay on the other side.  The grief I feel not a huge grief, just a lingering feeling that swells up from time to time, and happens to be surging today given the date.  It's certainly outpaced by gratitude.    Sending love and well wishes to all.",51,15,2019-09-27,induced labor,345,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,27 Weeks 1 Day,"Well the placental insufficiency got worse and Tessa Marie decided to come into the world early. She was born 2:02 PM 1 lbs 2 oz a 11 in long.

BabyBumps,Any FTMs in the 1st trimester feel invalidated when they get excited/emotional about their pregnancies?,"I deal with this often especially among people who already have living kids, and people who are further in their pregnancies than I am.  Maybe I'm just being too sensitive, but it's an IVF pregnancy so I am on a lot of drugs that probably make my emotions a lot worse!

Because I did IVF, I know the baby is a boy because I know what his chromosomes are. (It was PGS tested.)  I mistakenly referred to the embryo as ""he"" a couple times before it was even transferred into my uterus, and I felt incredibly embarrassed!  But since my BFP and beta (I'm 7+3) I feel a lot more comfortable saying ""he.""  After all, if I found out the gender at 15 weeks, I'd be saying ""he"" and the only reason most people don't do it at 7 weeks it that most people don't know it's a he! But every time I refer to it as ""he"" by accident, outside of my immediate family, people laugh at me, like even though I know the sex it's for some reason too early to refer to it.

I keep hearing dismissive comments (not on here) about how:

* There's no way you have symptoms, most people at your point don't even know they're pregnant (Really? Most people have missed a period for several weeks before taking a test? Most non-IVF pregnancies I see find out before 7 weeks, often in the 4-5w range)
* You don't know if this pregnancy is going to last anyway, it's so early (Thanks so much for fucking reminding me, I only worry about this, um...EVERY DAMN DAY) On that note though, at least we've done the PGS testing so I have more clarity about genetics at 7 weeks than most people do.
* It's too early for you to be getting ultrasounds, I didn't even get a blood test, I didn't get my ultrasound until 12 weeks (congrats!  It's an IVF PREGNANCY!  We get our ultrasounds before the baby is even in there, let alone after!!)
* Generally mocking/laughing about the idea that I could already feel connected to my pregnancy.  Excuse me but really?? I felt connected before I was even pregnant because I ""conceived"" this baby 6 months ago in a lab.  IVF parents *are* connected to their embryos.  My husband is the same way!  
* Just you wait, if you think the anxiety is bad now. (Yeah, I'm sure parenting in general is anxiety-provoking, but right now I have a much higher risk of loss than I'll have at 39 weeks so yeah, I'm going to be more worried about MC now.  I love this this line is juxtaposed with ""It's too early and you could lose it.""  So I should acknowledge I could have a loss, and...not care?)

I thought once I was pregnant, I would feel like part of the club, but I feel like I'm repeatedly reminded that I don't really count because I'm not pregnant enough.  How far along must I be before I'm allowed to have feelings?

Anyone else experience or used to experience this?  I know I shouldn't care about what people say, but I'm quite emotional (obviously) and it really just brings back all the infertility trauma about how I'm different from other people and I'll never get to be a mom.",46,81,2019-12-04,pregnancy trauma,557,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,My introduction - Hi everyone - 27 weeker,"How my NICU story starts is to know that I love New Year's Eve. It has always been my favorite day. This year started off shaky and full of drama and tears. 2020, I will never forget watching the ball drop through tears at Toronto Mount Sinai Triage on the Maternity floor on a tiny little screen. 

It was yet another reminder how the end of 2019 was also not the greatest. I found out I was pregnant at end of July at the same time I found out I had breast cancer which turned out eventually to be Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer that spread to my bones. Little did I know, I wasn't going to see myself back home anytime soon after the NYE.

After the sad ball drop moment, our life turned upside down yet again. We learned yet another medical term. pPROM. Preterm Premature Rupture of Membrane. This basically means the membrane around the baby rips a tiny bit and the amnio fluid leaks out. This leaves the baby dry and open to infection. Dangerous situation. 

8 days of constant poking, monitoring, strapped in, immobilization, doctor consults, etc. The possibility was to actually stay in that state for weeks on end (some women can go full term). Was willing to do that, but ""someone"" had another plan. Our superstar wanted to make an entrance and just wanted to join the world a little early. We can call her and over-achiever already. Who needs full term when you can exit at 27 weeks?

She is tiny but being a trooper. 1 lb 10 oz. (740 g for our euro fans) Long road ahead in NICU (estimated 3 months). There was some issue with stabilizing her after birth. Her lungs took a while to get going. She has had her full first day in NICU. Already causing issues with her apnea events. And low blood pressure. Is anyone else dealing with this? They say it's normal?

I feel guilty that I wasn't able to hold on longer. I feel guilty that I feel great physically and she is struggling to breath. How do people deal with this?",41,16,2020-01-10,premature birth,359,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,Inducing at 32 weeks.,"About 3 hours ago I found out that we are expecting our baby girl sometime in the next day or so. My wife developed high blood pressure about 3 weeks ago. For the past two days she's been in the Labor and Delivery ER trying to regulate her blood pressure. They gave her steroids for the babies lungs. She visited her baby shower via iPad/Facetime yesterday. I went and opened gifts, got my belly measured and wore the Mommy To Be sash as a representative. They told us this morning that they are going to induce, we just had breakfast and I am reading up on what to expect from a 32 week delivery. She had her Cervidil put in a couple hours ago.

I am happy to meet my daughter, but nervous at the same time. having the baby shower yesterday reminded me how strong and loving our support base is. I love this little girl and her mama so much.

I had my scheduled c-section Wednesday morning , with time of birth at 07:01 cst. It was rushed because LO had no variability in his heart rate. Nurse and OB used their non-alarmist way of saying ‚ÄúLO needs to come out!‚Äù by saying, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre having a baby this morning.‚Äù It was Deja V√∫ to my first born‚Äôs delivery. 


I was quickly prepped for the c-section and before I knew it LO was out. But he didn‚Äôt cry. His cord was abnormally thin and tightly wrapped around his ankle. LO‚Äôs doctor and my OB‚Äôs colleague were tending to him and were telling me that LO had pooped in uterine and they were concerned about his oxygen levels. The cord blood was measuring a bit too acidic. LO was rushed over to the nursery for more tests and a better evaluation while I was closed up. 


Once we were back in the recovery room, LO‚Äôs doctor came in and gave us an update. LO was going to be medivacced to Oklahoma University‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Hospital and going into the NICU. It‚Äôs better staffed and has all the proper equipment and specialists for LO. As more labs and tests were done on LO we were told that his O2 stats were too low and white blood cell count was too high. After testing his cord they determined that LO had suffered some sort of injury in the last 48 hours that effected the amount of oxygen going to his brain and there was damage. They‚Äôre giving LO 3 days of a cooling procedure to help with any inflammation and to prevent any further injury as well as treating him with antibiotics to address any infection he may have. He‚Äôll more than likely be in the NICU for a week or more. 


My OB is considered one of the best in the state and is very highly respected in her field. For all her experience, she doesn‚Äôt know what could have caused the initial injury. LO had been moving just fine,  even last night. The only change in anything was that yesterday I was so tired that I was constantly dozing off while sitting on the couch, as well as being unable to sleep Sunday and Monday night due to what I had assumed was nesting. When she came up to me and touched me on the shoulder, I 100% expected her to tell me LO had died/was brain dead. LO‚Äôs doctor is also very stoic and even hurt by his condition. My doctor is convinced had I come in even just a day later I‚Äôd have had a stillbirth.


I can‚Äôt help but feel ashamed that I did something to cause this. That my own stubbornness and nesting urges have caused so much hurt in my family. There are 4 sets of grandparents and they‚Äôre all emotional wrecks. My dad doesn‚Äôt cry, I‚Äôm 35 and have seen the man cry one other time. I could hear him choking up and stumbling when I spoke with him. I‚Äôll never forget that sound for the rest of my life. I‚Äôm not letting myself process this emotionally because I have to keep myself ready to hear the worst news, that this brain damage is severe and he‚Äôll never recover. That he‚Äôs a vegetable on life support. I had my tubes tied before I was stitched up and now I‚Äôve made a huge mistake. That this is my punishment for the 5 or 6 bowls of pot I smoked during the pregnancy on days my anxiety felt like a heart attack. And the worst: that I don‚Äôt deserve him and it‚Äôs for the best...

I never heard him cry. I hope all you other Covid-19 mommas will give your LO‚Äôs a big hug for me. Their crying maybe the most stressful thing you ever experience, and when you‚Äôre over it, try to remember what that crying truly means.",36,8,2020-04-24,pregnancy trauma,662,,,,,,,,,

The cord blood was measuring a bit too acidic. LO was rushed over to the nursery for more tests and a better evaluation while I was closed up. 


Once we were back in the recovery room, LO‚Äôs doctor came in and gave us an update. LO was going to be medivacced to Oklahoma University‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Hospital and going into the NICU. It‚Äôs better staffed and has all the proper equipment and specialists for LO. As more labs and tests were done on LO we were told that his O2 stats were too low and white blood cell count was too high. After testing his cord they determined that LO had suffered some sort of injury in the last 48 hours that effected the amount of oxygen going to his brain and there was damage. They‚Äôre giving LO 3 days of a cooling procedure to help with any inflammation and to prevent any further injury as well as treating him with antibiotics to address any infection he may have. He‚Äôll more than likely be in the NICU for a week or more. 


My OB is considered one of the best in the state and is very highly respected in her field. For all her experience, she doesn‚Äôt know what could have caused the initial injury. LO had been moving just fine,  even last night. The only change in anything was that yesterday I was so tired that I was constantly dozing off while sitting on the couch, as well as being unable to sleep Sunday and Monday night due to what I had assumed was nesting. When she came up to me and touched me on the shoulder, I 100% expected her to tell me LO had died/was brain dead. LO‚Äôs doctor is also very stoic and even hurt by his condition. My doctor is convinced had I come in even just a day later I‚Äôd have had a stillbirth.


I can‚Äôt help but feel ashamed that I did something to cause this. That my own stubbornness and nesting urges have caused so much hurt in my family. There are 4 sets of grandparents and they‚Äôre all emotional wrecks. My dad doesn‚Äôt cry, I‚Äôm 35 and have seen the man cry one other time. I could hear him choking up and stumbling when I spoke with him. I‚Äôll never forget that sound for the rest of my life. I‚Äôm not letting myself process this emotionally because I have to keep myself ready to hear the worst news, that this brain damage is severe and he‚Äôll never recover. That he‚Äôs a vegetable on life support. I had my tubes tied before I was stitched up and now I‚Äôve made a huge mistake. That this is my punishment for the 5 or 6 bowls of pot I smoked during the pregnancy on days my anxiety felt like a heart attack. And the worst: that I don‚Äôt deserve him and it‚Äôs for the best...

I never heard him cry. I hope all you other Covid-19 mommas will give your LO‚Äôs a big hug for me. Their crying maybe the most stressful thing you ever experience, and when you‚Äôre over it, try to remember what that crying truly means.",36,8,2020-04-24,pregnancy stress,662,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,Surprise third baby - Still traumatized by second birth (long),"Hi guys, long time reddit lurker, finally signed up. I'm 36 years old and 22+6 weeks pregnant with my third child. 
My youngest child is 2 1/2 and her birth was a nightmare. I had a precipitous labor of one hour at 40+2 weeks and walked into the hospital with her head poking out and meconium everywhere. To make matters worse, I had a complete retained placenta after the midwife lifted my daughter into the air, snapping the cord off. I started haemorraging and by the time an operating theater was available for manual removal I had lost nearly 2 liters of blood. 
I was not planning on any more children but managed to fall pregnant despite contraception. I can't put into words how terrified I am of the birth. I'm excited about the baby but I don't want to die. It's like I can't even see past the birth, it's the be all and end all of everything. My partner is quite blase about it and says if it happens again they'll just fix it. That's not the point! Has anyone been in this situation and managed to get a grip on their fears?",35,18,2019-11-29,PTSD pregnancy,195,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Tips for a discreet pregnancy?,"I'm currently 6w+3 with my 2nd. I'd ideally like to not disclose my pregnancy for as long as possible (definitely not until after the 1st trimester), but a couple things might endanger this: one, Thanksgiving and Christmas, and the fact that with this pregnancy I feel like *garbage* (constant GI discomfort/nausea) almost 24/7.  

This pregnancy was planned but I just **love** my privacy and want to stave off the unsolicited commentary/advice for as long as possible (especially anything related to preterm birth, because our first was a NICU baby). Another element is our daughter is 17m so the ""when are you going to start trying for another?"" 's are coming in more and more frequently. Any tips on hiding a pregnancy? Specifically for the holiday season where we will be around a lot of family, food, and alcohol? My husband has already tried to teach me how to ""take"" a shot and spit it discreetly into a chaser, so there's that, but I told him if I absolutely have to have part of a drink to avoid being interrogated then for the sake of my mental health, I will.

NICUParents,On the fence about a second pregnancy?,"Hi everyone - former NICU mom when our daughter that was born at 34w0d after I had severe preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and a whole host of other issues. Our daughter spent 21 days in the NICU due to bradys/desats and feeding issues. By far, the end of my pregnancy (which included a 3+ week hospital stay) and her NICU journey was the most difficult period of my life. Looking back, I can honestly say I was in a bad depression.

However, she‚Äôs been the absolute best baby/toddler. My husband and I always assumed we would have at least two children, but the experience we went through made us strongly consider being one and done. Both of us are very worried about the possibility of repeating the same issues in a second pregnancy or having a worse outcome. Prior to pregnancy, I was an average, healthy person but I find my health still recovering even 2 years later. 

I‚Äôve seen two doctors to discuss a second pregnancy and I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with the conversations. Both told me that a second pregnancy ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù be life-threatening again because they‚Äôll be able to monitor and medicate any issues ahead of time. The first MFM doctor was very rude, cold and said that a NICU stay isn‚Äôt that bad because ‚Äúthey‚Äôre great babysitters and you get to sleep at home while they care for the baby.‚Äù The second doctor was much more compassionate and said that the pregnancy could be managed but I needed to consider my own feelings and experiences.

Just looking for general advice from those who had a NICU baby and health issues but decided to have a second. 

TL:dr I had a very difficult first pregnancy that was life-threatening and resulted in a NICU stay. I‚Äôm considering having a second child and want some advice.",31,47,2019-10-21,pregnancy depression,304,,,,,,,,,

Obviously I‚Äôm in close take with doctors and specialists. I suppose I‚Äôm just looking for other people to find comfort in.

NICUParents,Daughter born 1/29 at 34+4,"Hi All, I've been lurking since my wife got pregnant and we learned it would be a possibility of having a premie due to some underlying health conditions my wife has, previous losses, and a unicornuate uterus. 

Quick Side Bar: while our baby girl is our first born, we also have a 3 year old foster daughter who is currently on the track for adoption (by us). 

Now, here's how our newest and first bio-daughter wound up in the NICU:

My wife had been having a few slightly higher BP readings the few couple of weeks and an elevated protein/creatine ratio. The OBs weren't initially concerned about all that because it was closer but not to the level of preeclampsia yet. Then she started getting daily headaches and more feet/hand swelling than usual up to this point.

In subsequent appointments she had urine dips and they all came back negative for protein but the headaches and swelling would not go away. So at her MFM appt on Tuesday the 28th the doctor took one look at her and said right away he had a cure for her, labor and delivery. Baby was laying transverse and the cord was in front of the cervix, so he said she would need to have a cesarian, but he was going to defer to L&D so he sent us down to get checked out.

After 24 hours of trying to get her headache and blood pressure under control, to no avail, the OBs determined the safest thing would be to deliver. There wasn't any benefit to keeping baby in because with pre-e she wasn't going to thrive. After a few more hours of debate on induction vs cesarian -- because the cord may have moved? spoiler alert it didn't -- they finally took us in for the cesarian and our daughter was born at 2:41pm on the 29th. 

My wife got to see her briefly before they took baby to the NICU. Wife was then confined to her bed for 24hrs due to being on magnesium so I followed and stayed with baby girl for a bit until my wife was out of recovery.

**Now - on to baby and NICU the last few days**

Baby was 5lbs 4oz at birth which I was very surprised about. But then again, she was doing perfectly fine before the pre-e set in. All things considered she was doing very well at birth -- main troubles included torticollis, rapid respiratory rate, and jaundice (which was discovered today. She didn't get formula/milk until about 12 hours after birth, and did it via NG tube. She also got a TPN and lipids..which she is being weaned off of as her milk intake increases -- tonight she took 22mL via bottle when i fed her!  

She also came off of the heater yesterday and is in a regular bassinet. And they just took off her oxygen cannula today. 

I feel like she's progressing very quickly but at the same time she's still not totally great on the sucking thing and she's on the light therapy. 

My wife gets discharged on Sunday and it's going to be so tough to go home without our sweet little one but we need to go home to finish getting things ready...we thought we had at LEAST a few more weeks after all. I guess that's what we get for being unprepared.

The hospital is about 45 min away from home so the drive isn't too long but also feels like hours. 

Sorry to wrap this up so quickly, it's late here and I really should get some rest because I have to get up with my wife to pump in a couple hours. So feel free to ask any questions or share advice you may have. I gotta say, NICU nurses are fucking saints. I love them all.",31,6,2020-02-02,late delivery,644,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Baby is in the 99th percentile for size. I feel like a traumatic birth is inevitable and I‚Äôm scared.,"Gosh, maybe it‚Äôs hormones but I got misty-eyed just writing my post title. 

I‚Äôm a FTM, 30w 3d, and my son is enormous. He‚Äôs measuring four weeks larger than his gestational age. Over the past few months he‚Äôs gone from the 93rd percentile, to the 96th, and now 99th. I was hoping he would slow down but he just keeps getting larger. My OB even sent me to a specialist with one of those fancy 3d ultrasounds, so I don‚Äôt think the estimations are off. 

I do not have gestational diabetes or any health condition that would cause this to happen. They even had me do a 3 hour glucose test to be sure, and I passed with flying colors. I guess it‚Äôs just genetics. I was 9lbs 6oz. My two cousins were over 10 and over 11 lbs respectively (my aunt does have diabetes and obesity). All of us were delivered vaginally and my mom says I was a smooth delivery. 

But I‚Äôm still terrified. I was told by a gynecologist in the past that I have a narrow vagina. So even if my son was not huge, I would be afraid of tearing. It seems inevitable that I‚Äôm going to end up with either a 3rd or 4th degree tear, or I‚Äôll have to have a c-section. He also most likely has a double nuchal cord (nearly impossible to detect for sure even with the fancy ultrasound) which means labor will be even more terrifying for me as I will be in fear of my baby‚Äôs circulation being cut off. My OB tried to reassure me, said that every situation is different, that some people have no trouble delivering a 10 lb baby vaginally and others have trouble with a 6 lb baby. I don‚Äôt know why but I still feel like there‚Äôs no way this is going to go well for me.

Since I‚Äôm a FTM, I‚Äôve been reading birth stories for months in an effort to better prepare myself. I think the stories are fascinating but it‚Äôs not helping my anxiety at all. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm a medical coding auditor. My profession involves reading only the most complicated medical charts, so when I work on delivery cases I never see the ones that go smoothly. That skewed perspective probably isn‚Äôt helping. I‚Äôm planning on doing a tour of the hospital‚Äôs maternity ward with my husband this month, but I don‚Äôt know how much that will help. 

I have 10 weeks to go and I just want to stop being scared. Any advice is very, very appreciated.",30,53,2020-01-03,gestational age,433,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Multiple soft markers + a short cervix ... SAD is the word,"Update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/ffia85/update\_to\_my\_anatomy\_scan\_filled\_with\_soft/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/ffia85/update_to_my_anatomy_scan_filled_with_soft/) 

X-post from my monthly bumpers sub! Very long post...apologize in advance!

TLDR: Several soft markers found in my 19 week anatomy scan plus a short cervix after low risk NIPT and normal 14 week NT scan. Amniocentesis scheduled for Wednesday morning.

Hi everyone! FTM here, 33 years old in the US. Everything was going great and I was feeling positive until my anatomy scan yesterday.

So my first trimester was breezy, no morning sickness or nausea, just the unbearable headaches here and there. Still running, still working out, still putting in long hours at my (demanding) office job. I thought I could do everything normally until my due date in July! My 14 week NT scan was normal and I also opted for NIPT which came back low risk and news of a baby girl! All blood work came back normal and I was considered low risk.

The second trimester also started out pretty uneventful. My belly was starting to show and although I didn't like the weight gain (body issues all throughout my life), I was feeling very lucky to be able to be a home to a growing baby girl for a few months. My husband and I couldn't wait to see our daughter during our anatomy scan! I even brought my mom along so she could see her granddaughter.

Our anatomy scan was scheduled for 9am on a Friday. The tech did a vaginal US first to measure the cervix and look at the placenta. Then she moved to my belly where she did all her other measurements. We saw baby girl's feet (she was moving so much!), her stomach, and her little face. We saw one open hand and heard her heartbeat. Her weight was at a normal 12 ounces. The tech stepped outside to get the doctor, which she never has had to before with my other ultrasounds. The doctor came in and right off the bat told us there were a few issues that they found.

First, she said my cervix was short and suspected for insufficiency, which might mean possible miscarriage or preterm birth. I would have to come back in two weeks to see if it has changed, and if not, I may need to take meds or a stitch, which I thought was doable, as long as the baby is fine. I'll take any pain or procedure to ensure that my daughter will be born healthy.

Then, the blow to our happiness ... she said there were a few soft markers for trisomies that they were seeing: (a) CPC, soft marker for trisomy 18, (b) echogenic focus, soft marker for trisomy 13 and 21, and (c) pyelectasis, soft marker for trisomy 21. She also said that since one hand wouldn't open up, that could mean trisomy 18 and also my nuchal fold was measuring a little bigger than it should which we all know could be a soft marker for Downs.

Our smiles all of a sudden turned to worry and doubt. How could everything come all at once? How was it possible that my NIPT was low risk as well as my 14 week NT scan and every blood test was normal, and now I am at risk for all of these trisomies? The doctor said that if there was only one soft marker, they wouldn't worry so much, but since there were several, it would be best if I went to see a genetic counselor, who luckily had room for us within the next 30 minutes. We rushed upstairs and I broke down in her office. My husband was angry and upset and I was crying hysterically, mostly because it was such a shock and I definitely did not wake up thinking I would have to deal with anything like this that day.

She explained to us that the NIPT and the ultrasounds are only screening tests and the only way to get a definite diagnostic is to do an amniocentesis, if we choose, which we did not hesitate to do. She squeezed us in for this coming Wednesday which would mean we would get preliminary results that Friday. I understood the risk for miscarriage but I also knew that the information the amnio could give us outweighed the risks.

I have been crying and worrying for the past 24 hours and just feeling sad and depressed. I can't even look at anything baby related and answer any questions about my baby without crying. I've been spending my time reading posts on Reddit about women seeing several soft markers in their US and things ending up fine but also a few posts of things going not so fine. I am really just trying to stay positive and not to think about it until my amnio on Wednesday but it's so hard not feel robbed of the pregnancy that I was envisioning. It's just been a dark cloud for my husband and I. We are still unsure of what we would do if we received news that the baby was positive for something...I know I am also on a timeline because IF we choose to terminate, I would only have until week 24...that's the end of this month!

Anyway, I just really needed to vent and type out my emotions. Thanks for reading if you made it all the way down here! :)",30,19,2020-03-01,preterm birth,896,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,"Feeling so sad, need to vent","I have been feeling so sad the last couple days, just needed to vent a little. My daughter has been in the NICU almost 7 weeks now. She had surgery this past Wednesday to correct an issue with a heart valve wrapping around her trachea and esophagus. It went really well and she is otherwise very healthy and we are SO grateful. 

 I've been sort of grieving the fact that everything has been so far from what we imagined (I know, the NICU is not really in anyone's birth plan.) I was sent for an appointment at a hospital an hour away from home and they decided to induce me right then- different city, different hospital than we planned. I ended up having an emergency C-section and didn't see her until the next day. We're far from home, which is hard enough. I'm sad that we can't hold her much, I feel like she's laying there looking at me thinking 'Hey mom! Hold me!! Her first Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas will be spent in the hospital. We tried for almost 3 years before getting pregnant with her, our first, and it just feels like a cruel joke - you finally have your dream come true and BAM! Sorry, still can't have your baby. Not only will I have to go back to work so soon after she's able to come home, but I feel like we sort of missed out on her being a newborn. (She was born 38+6 so she was full term.) I am really struggling to pump milk too. Barely get 20 mL each time. I feel like I'm failing at even trying to feed her! 

Now I know we are very lucky, all things considered. There are so many babies and families here that are going through much harder situations than we are. Everyone around me keeps telling me ""it could be worse"" and I know it could, but I feel like my feelings are being dismissed. I understand it could be worse, but it doesn't make my feeling of sadness any less real. 

Just needed to vent. It's been a rough few days. I'm sure that these feelings are all normal- or at least normal in the NICU?",30,12,2019-12-07,full term birth,373,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,How long did you go with your second / third pregnancy?,"Hi friends,   


My daughter was born three years ago at 33w3d after an uneventful, healthy pregnancy due to PPROM. We never figured out what caused the PPROM; there was no infection, cervical shortening wasn't confirmed, etc. 

We were lucky; we only spent 17 days in the NICU before taking her home healthy. But still, as I'm sure you can relate, our little one being in the NICU was one of the most stressful times of our lives and one that I'm not eager to repeat.   


Here I am 21w3d pregnant with my second baby. I thought that my daughter being born so early was a fluke and that it wouldn't happen again, but my OB was monitoring me pretty closely and found that I had a drop in cervical length between 18 and 20 weeks from 4.7cm to 2.6-3.0cm which is pretty dramatic. 

I'm on progesterone suppositories and go in again today, a week after my last, for another ultrasound. My OB has suggested I'll probably get a cerclage put in, and I'm not sure how effective they are, but I'm still really interested to hear...

NICUParents,Just joined this club on Thursday and looking for some support and advice.,"Hi everyone. On Thursday I gave birth to my baby boy via c-section at 28 weeks and 2 days. He‚Äôs doing great in the NICU but I‚Äôm really struggling for a few reasons. I‚Äôm here in the hospital alone because of the pandemic (my husband is waiting out a self-quarantine because of international travel and won‚Äôt be able to visit until Sunday. He was able to attend the birth with proper distancing and protocol). I‚Äôm pumping every two hours and in a lot of pain from the operation so I‚Äôm reliant on the nurses for absolutely everything - helping me shift stuff around my room, adjusting lights, washing pump parts, etc. - and I‚Äôm constantly meeting with nurses, doctors, case managers, lactation consultants, calling down to the NICU, etc.

Because I‚Äôm handling this alone it‚Äôs been really hard for me to actually spend lots of time at the NICU with my baby. I manage maybe two visits a day and I feel incredibly guilty. I know lots of time holding him and doing skin to skin is best for him but I‚Äôm in a situation where I pump and then a bunch of people poke their heads in to lay a bunch of information on my lap and they have to draw blood or flush my IV or push on my stomach and by then it‚Äôs time to pump again and I try to rush down to the NICU and I have fifty bazillion missed texts/calls because everyone wants to see the baby and I‚Äôm just so tired dealing with it by myself. My sister in law has been here for a few hours every day with me (I‚Äôve been in the hospital since March 7 due to risk of preterm labor) and she‚Äôs been great but it‚Äôs really hard at night when I‚Äôm exhausted.

I know I only have to get through another 24 hours before my husband gets here but it‚Äôs just been so tough. I meditate, I look at photos of my baby and my older son, I still feel like I struggle. I delivered my oldest child vaginally at full term and did not anticipate this level of helplessness, moreover doing it in a pandemic where traditional ways people would help (babysitting my older son so husband can help, visiting me in the hospital) have been taken off the table by doctors.

Have any of you been in a similar situation and have tips/advice for me, or just words of support? Thanks in advance for the wisdom of this group!",29,23,2020-03-21,preterm labor,424,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,My mental health is suffering since getting pregnant and I‚Äôm afraid nothing will help.,"I don‚Äôt know if I even want advice or if I just want to feel less alone.  I really hope I‚Äôm not the only one going through this (I‚Äôm not that special so probably not.) 

Background: I‚Äôve always had anxiety and been diagnosed with OCD since 17. I‚Äôve tried 4 different SSRIs at varying doses, and been in therapy for over 20 years with a variety of different style therapists including CBT. Only one therapist made significant improvements and he‚Äôs way out of state (and my dad was paying at the time- I can‚Äôt afford him and I‚Äôm now too old for my dad to pay.) SSRIs do nothing, which is common for OCD. The only drugs that work are the ones that basically sedate me to the point where I can‚Äôt do anything but that‚Äôs hardly a good life lol. I can start therapy again in January (ran out of sessions this year) but I‚Äôm really dubious that it‚Äôll even help. 

Our ‚Äújourney‚Äù to get pregnant was really hard, as we did IVF, and we have a 0% chance of natural conception. Yes I‚Äôm aware some people have it harder but infertility was a trauma for me. So maybe for that reason I‚Äôm plagued with thoughts that this pregnancy is only a dream, that the other shoe will drop. I imagine life saying ‚Äúoh you thought you graduated from infertility? Ha!‚Äù I still feel jealous of pregnant women and moms. I still hide people on Facebook who announce pregnancies. My husband pointed out that I act like our IVF didn‚Äôt work and he‚Äôs right. 

I cant even list everything I‚Äôve worried about since my BFP. I was overjoyed at first (still am...give me all the nausea/fatigue I want this baby so badly!) but that quickly devolved into a listeria obsession where I‚Äôm scared of eating any food that isn‚Äôt hot. I cant even imagine eating sushi, which I love. I read Expecting Better but felt it glossed over the areas I worry about the most. How can listeria be a 1/8,000 risk when it‚Äôs on 1 in 5 avocados? Nobody can explain this to me.  I‚Äôm afraid to take Tylenol. I‚Äôm afraid to drink juice. I eat plenty of food but I miss cold food. I‚Äôm even afraid to drink decaf tea as I read it can prevent folate absorption.

My symptoms (or lack thereof) are also a huge source of anxiety. I was pretty sick early on but at 8 weeks began feeling a little better and now at 10 weeks barely can tell I‚Äôm pregnant. We saw a great heartbeat at 8 weeks so I want to believe everything is okay but ‚Äúa gradual decrease in symptoms‚Äù is obviously a sign of MC. RE told me it‚Äôs normal right about now and didn‚Äôt want to scan me again. I still worry. 

I worry about my arcuate uterus causing 2nd trimester loss. RE says it won‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt believe her.  I‚Äôve seen websites saying it does. She says they‚Äôre wrong, I ruminate. 

And of course I worry ABOUT worry. My husband told me that my anxiety is ‚Äúhurting the baby.‚Äù Great. Now if God forbid anything does happen I‚Äôll blame myself. But I can‚Äôt control the emotions I feel. I‚Äôm still able to eat healthy, stay active and somehow sleep a full night. What else can I do?

The advice I get mostly seems to come from a place of ‚Äúhow can I minimize how annoying you are to ME?‚Äù I know everyone thinks I‚Äôm annoying. No longer speaking about how I feel and isolating myself isn‚Äôt going to make me less anxious. ‚ÄúStaying off the internet‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to make me less anxious (although I‚Äôm no longer researching stuff.) people‚Äôs advice to me is basically ‚Äúgo away you‚Äôre annoying.‚Äù Like being annoying is even my biggest concern right now. 

The women on my bumper sub are doing cute announcements, buying stuff for the baby and talking names. They‚Äôre eating sushi and deli meat. Im so jealous. I wish I could be so certain that everything will be fine. I wish I could buy a baby onesie. I hate even walking into the nursery or calling it a nursery at all. I don‚Äôt have my next scan until 12 weeks and despite ‚Äúknowing‚Äù that my risk of loss is in the ballpark of 1% my mind feels like it‚Äôs a 15% or so risk. I just want to enjoy my pregnancy. I thought I‚Äôd be so happy once I got here but I‚Äôm so scared!

I hope that I‚Äôll feel better once he‚Äôs here but I know that‚Äôs absurd because I thought I‚Äôd feel better once I got pregnant and although I‚Äôm ridiculously happy to BE pregnant I regularly question if I even am.",28,55,2019-12-22,pregnancy trauma,796,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Week 26+4 Update: PPROM at 22+4 with di/di twins (warning: loss),"Original post: https://reddit.com/r/NICUParents/comments/dtltvr/pprom_at_224_with_didi_twins/

First update:
https://www.reddit.com/r/NICUParents/comments/e17uzf/update_pprom_at_224_with_didi_twins_warning_loss/

Hey all, thanks again for sending your love any good wishes and prayers. We are currently at 26 weeks and 4 days this morning and still pregnant with our second daughter.

We are experiencing what the medical community describes as ""delayed interval delivery"" where the birth of the first twin is followed by a period of days or weeks before the delivery of the second twin.

As described in our first update, our first baby girl was lost November 11 and was born on November 12. We have been blessed with almost a month of mostly stable conditions and monitoring since then.

The doctors have been following the general recommended course of action for a PPROM (preterm, pre-labor rupture of membrane) even though our little girl in utero still has intact membranes, she is still at heightened risk of infection. So we have been monitored 3 times a day, temperature, blood pressure and NST monitoring.

On early Thursday morning, baby's heart-rate had a prolonged (6 minute) decel which prompted prolonged monitoring which caught a few, more minor decels which prompted medical interventions. My wife received magnesium infusion for 12 hours and the first shot of the second round of betamethasone. Worth noting that my wife was not feeling contractions; the magnesium was neuroprotective in case they needed to perform an emergency c-section that night. We were also kept on 24 hour monitoring to make sure the decels weren't recurring.

Yesterday was remarkably uneventful and we went from about 3 AM to midnight without any marked decels. Unfortunately this morning around midnight we had another lengthy decel and a second later this morning.

My wife is back on the magnesium, but thankfully it is helping her rest, and we haven't seen any dips for about 5 hours. Rounds should be in the next hour or two, but it's unlikely we will know more afterward.

We are so glad that we have a team of doctors and nurses around us who are looking out for my wife and baby's best interests. Everyone wants this baby to keep gestating as long as possible, but the repeat prolonged decels have everyone on edge.

Was anyone else delivered early, before labor, due to fetal heart rate issues? We met again with a NICU nurse yesterday who explained the basics of reading preemie body language and bonding with LO in the NICU. We'd love to prolong our stay at the most expensive hotel either of us will ever stay at, but if it's best for baby we may be becoming NICU parents sooner than later.",27,6,2019-12-06,preterm birth,435,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,My Endoscopy while pregnant experience.,"(I posted this in my bumper sub, but wanted it to be searchable here as well, in case it helps someone looking for experiences) 

Warning, long post ahead! 

I wanted to share my experience with this because when I was searching trying to find someone who had an endoscopy while pregnant, I couldn‚Äôt find a whole lot. If anyone needs to talk about this, don‚Äôt be afraid to message me, even if this post is years old! 

I had an upper GI endoscopy today at 14 weeks and 3 days pregnant. I have been having stomach pain basically 24/7 since August (since I was 4-5 weeks). I was diagnosed with Hyperemisis Gravidarum and gastritis. After months of meds for the gastritis (including a switch to something stronger) my condition wasn‚Äôt improving at all. I‚Äôve lost over 20 pounds from being unable to eat much.  Eating causes intense pain no matter what I eat or how much. (If you want more details about my symptoms, feel free to ask!) 

The GI specialist first told me that I would be sedated and given an anxiety medication for the procedure. She said since I was pregnant, they‚Äôd give me the minimal amount to stay on the safe side. She also assured me that the procedure was generally safe and that the risk was less than what my weight loss and lack of adequate nutrition could do if it continued. I was warned though that fetal death was possible due to the drugs given. Whatever would sedate me would sedate the baby. She also said there is slight evidence that the procedure could lead to a lower birth weight but that she didn‚Äôt think preterm labor was a concern. 

So today was the procedure. A labor and delivery nurse was called to come check the baby via Doppler. It was at this time that my GI doctor informed me that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get the anxiety medication or the usual sedation drugs because I was pregnant and it wasn‚Äôt safe enough for the Ob‚Äôs comfort. Instead she said they would numb my throat and give me a small amount of Demerol, which is a class B pain killer. I was to be fully awake and conscious for the procedure as opposed to sedated or even twilight sedated. 

I was very freaked out. 

The numbing spray was super gross and it burned my throat a lot. The Demerol went in via IV and that burned too. They ended up giving me 3x the amount of Demerol than she planned because my body just absorbs painkillers, but it was still a safe dosage. 

The rest of the procedure was awful but quick. Because I was fully awake, I gagged almost the entire time. Lots of deep air burps and gagging. They tell you not to swallow but it‚Äôs impossible to not. You also can‚Äôt breath through your mouth and that can be a bit anxiety inducing as well, especially when you‚Äôre gagging so frequently it feels like you can‚Äôt catch your breath. Every so often I‚Äôd feel like the tube settled and I‚Äôd stop gagging, only for her to move the tube or blow air into my stomach, causing the gagging all over again.  My whole body was shaking hard from the unpleasantness of it all. 

The doctor was kind and kept saying encouraging things and giving me a countdown of how much longer it would be.  The relief I felt when she pulled the tube out was amazing. I was insanely relaxed  almost immediately and was so excited it was done. 

Because they didn‚Äôt really sedate me, I didn‚Äôt have to spend too long in recovery. I got another Doppler scan (baby‚Äôs heart sounded just as good as before the procedure) and then I was sent home with instructions to not drive for the rest of the day. 

The only thing they found was that I have a small hiatal hernia. She said this shouldn‚Äôt be causing my symptoms though. 

I‚Äôve felt fine since the procedure. I have a super mild sore throat but my stomach and esophagus don‚Äôt feel any different. I was able to eat as soon as I got home. 

Now I just wait on the biopsy results to see if anything hidden is going on. 

Overall this experience really really sucked. I hope that if I ever have to have this done in the future, I‚Äôll be able to be fully sedated for it, but at least now I know I can get through it without sedation and it won‚Äôt be the total end of the world. 

That being said, I would take this experience over the medically induced panic attack I had when I was given IV Reglan in the ER a few months ago lol.",27,15,2019-10-12,preterm birth,798,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Preterm Labor,I am 35 weeks today and went into labor last Wednesday. They were able to shut it down and I‚Äôve been at home on bedrest since leaving the hospital. I feel terrible and the nifedipine (contraction stopping medicine) wears off quicker every day and the contractions get worse. Back labor was terrible again just last night. I can‚Äôt imagine feeling this terrible for another week or two. I can only walk at a 90 degree angle because the pain is so bad. The doctor just wants me to hang in til 37 weeks for an induction. Send your happy thoughts my way because this is really getting to be unbearable.,27,9,2020-03-02,preterm labor,110,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Week 26+4 Update: PPROM at 22+4 with di/di twins (warning: loss),"Original post: https://reddit.com/r/NICUParents/comments/dtltvr/pprom_at_224_with_didi_twins/

First update:
https://www.reddit.com/r/NICUParents/comments/e17uzf/update_pprom_at_224_with_didi_twins_warning_loss/

Hey all, thanks again for sending your love any good wishes and prayers. We are currently at 26 weeks and 4 days this morning and still pregnant with our second daughter.

We are experiencing what the medical community describes as ""delayed interval delivery"" where the birth of the first twin is followed by a period of days or weeks before the delivery of the second twin.

As described in our first update, our first baby girl was lost November 11 and was born on November 12. We have been blessed with almost a month of mostly stable conditions and monitoring since then.

The doctors have been following the general recommended course of action for a PPROM (preterm, pre-labor rupture of membrane) even though our little girl in utero still has intact membranes, she is still at heightened risk of infection. So we have been monitored 3 times a day, temperature, blood pressure and NST monitoring.

On early Thursday morning, baby's heart-rate had a prolonged (6 minute) decel which prompted prolonged monitoring which caught a few, more minor decels which prompted medical interventions. My wife received magnesium infusion for 12 hours and the first shot of the second round of betamethasone. Worth noting that my wife was not feeling contractions; the magnesium was neuroprotective in case they needed to perform an emergency c-section that night. We were also kept on 24 hour monitoring to make sure the decels weren't recurring.

Yesterday was remarkably uneventful and we went from about 3 AM to midnight without any marked decels. Unfortunately this morning around midnight we had another lengthy decel and a second later this morning.

My wife is back on the magnesium, but thankfully it is helping her rest, and we haven't seen any dips for about 5 hours. Rounds should be in the next hour or two, but it's unlikely we will know more afterward.

We are so glad that we have a team of doctors and nurses around us who are looking out for my wife and baby's best interests. Everyone wants this baby to keep gestating as long as possible, but the repeat prolonged decels have everyone on edge.

Was anyone else delivered early, before labor, due to fetal heart rate issues? We met again with a NICU nurse yesterday who explained the basics of reading preemie body language and bonding with LO in the NICU. We'd love to prolong our stay at the most expensive hotel either of us will ever stay at, but if it's best for baby we may be becoming NICU parents sooner than later.",26,6,2019-12-06,early delivery,435,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,I know this might be a long shot but any mommas out there who were on mental health medications during pregnancy?,My husband and I are a month away from trying to start our family. I live in Chicago and am fortunate enough to have my psychiatrist and gyno at the same amazing hospital. I am bipolar and my doctors agreed the benefits of me remaining on my meds during pregnancy outweigh any risk to the baby. (I am on 100 mg of seroquel). I‚Äôm terrified but I know that I will slip into horrible mania or depression without my meds. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm making the right decision but I so desperately want to be a mom. Anyone have their own experience they would care to share that‚Äôs similar to mine?,25,33,2019-11-15,mental health during pregnancy,112,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,IUGR premie,"Hello all.  First time posting.  I wanted to share my experience and also have somewhere to post updates.  With all the research I've done, I've found that most people share what they've gone through with their babies up to the age of two or so, and leave it at that.  I am hoping to periodically come back to this to leave remarks on how we've progressed throughout the years.  I'm hoping to provide updates on how she's growing, how she's doing once she starts school, what her learning skills are like.  Obviously, this won't be the same for everybody, but maybe provide a little comfort for those going through this too.  So here's my story:

We found out we were pregnant on 3/7/19.  I had an 8 week ultrasound and all went ok.  They had initially put my due date at Oct 20th or so, but after that ultrasound, they changed it to October 30th based on her measuring at 8 weeks.

My next ultrasound was not scheduled until I was 19 weeks along.  At this ultrasound, they found the baby to only be measuring at 17 weeks, not 19.  I figured we were just adjusting the due date, but they felt this was a red flag and sent me to a specialist.

Here, they began doing all kinds of tests to determine why she was small.  I had an amnio test checking for chromosomal issues, infections, genetic disorders, etc.  All the tests came back negative.  They began monitoring me weekly, watching the blood flow in the umbilical cord, her growth, blood flow in the brain.  Everything was coming back normal.  They are deducing the issue to being with the placenta since they can find no other explanation.  As I am currently in the hospital waiting to be induced tomorrow, I wanted to share my timeline, the best that I can remember it up to this point. 

6/28/19  Should be 22 weeks, but she's (yes, it's a girl) only measuring at 18 weeks and weighing 253 grams.  They are preparing us for the worst, including early delivery, and the low chances of survival.  They couldn't tell us if she'd be healthy, physically or mentally.  The stress of it all, bringing a baby into the world that would be suffering, the struggle it would put on our family, my other children, was causing me to consider termination at one point.  I was a total mess, I couldn't get any straight answers because they didn't have any.  My husband and I decided to go forward and accept whatever may come.

7/12/19  24 weeks, measuring at 20-21 weeks, 357 grams.

7/17/19  25 weeks, measuring at 22, weighing 421 grams.  Got a second opinion.  Maybe they just had my due date wrong.  But no.  Based on all the information, 25 weeks is where I should be.  Baby IS growing, she's just small.  They don't know why.  They don't know if she'll survive.  Each week we make it is another milestone accomplished and reason to be grateful.  Both doctors are convinced we won't make it past 34 weeks.  That was heartbreaking to hear as I didn't really understand why.

7/19/19  Met with the NICU doctor to discuss what to expect, and whether we should be getting steroid shots (both specialists agreed on everything except whether I should get the shots, and when to get them).  Doctor convinced us to go ahead with shots to help with lung and brain functions.  This would help mostly if we needed to deliver this early.  NICU dr also explained that going past 34 weeks would put the baby at a higher risk of stillbirth, and delivering at 34 was not bad.

7/26/19  26 weeks, 474 grams

8/1/19  Baby has gained more than 100 grams in 2 weeks and while she is below the third percentile, her growth curve is still on par with the typical curve and as long as we are, specialist thinks we might make it to 34 weeks, but is still being cautious.

8/8/19  28 weeks and weighing 561 grams.  (For perspective, the fiftieth percentile at 28 weeks should be about 1200 grams),  We're hoping to make it to 30 weeks and gain another 150g.

8/21/19  30 weeks, measuring at 26 weeks - 701 grams.  Proportionately, everything looks good.  Specialist thinks we might be able to push delivery out to 36 weeks.

8/27/19  Weekly ultrasound checks now adds 20 minutes of being on the monitors to check for contractions and watching heart rate.

9/3/19  32 weeks, measuring at 27 weeks, 974 grams.

9/8/19  Second round of steroids

9/17/19  2lb 7oz.  Only a 5oz growth in 2 weeks. 

9/19/19  Baby has not grown enough to stay in.  Got sent to the hospital to discuss a third round of steroids and delivery options.  Because last steroids came two weeks ago, they (NICU and delivery doctor) said a third round may not necessarily be beneficial.  Baby is head down so a c-section was not needed.  We began softening the cervix and will begin Pitocin in the morning.  I can't help but feel a little disappointed that we didn't make it to at least 36 weeks.  I know making it to 34 is a huge accomplishment, but there are many things I'm missing out on now, such as the joy of being so pregnant, not being able to keep my little bun in the oven.  But as previously mentioned, the risk of her being in there vs the help we can give her out here outweighs all else.  I will provide updates after delivery and during recovery/NICU of our experience.  Thanks for reading.",25,18,2019-09-20,early delivery,933,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Told to diet while pregnant in Japan at a normal bmi,"TRIGGER WARNING for anyone sensitive to topics around weight/eating disorders etc

So to give a little background info:
I'm 23 years old, 169cm tall, and before I got pregnant I was 62/63kg. I'm from England but I am living in Japan, and will give birth here.
I have had a history if eating disorders (anorexia/bulimia) since I was a teenager, but I managed to recover before getting pregnant (for the sake of my baby and pregnancy).
I'm now 13 weeks pregnant, and I weigh 65kg (bmi of 22.7), so I've gained around 2-3kg. 
My morning sickness is the kind of morning sickness that didn't make me throw up, but I still get painfully nauseous and the only way to manage that is to eat regularly/enough, and the only food I've been able to stomach is simple carbohydrates/junk food, which is probably why I've gained weight.
I'm aware that I should be eating healthier but I planned to eat as healthy and as many nutricious foods as possible as soon as my morning sickness subsides.

Recently I went for a check up at the maternity clinic, and I didn't know I will be weighed so I ate breakfast and lunch before leaving, and I was then weighed (also with all my clothes on) so I wasn't surprised that I weighed 67kg, and I explained to the nurse that I had already eaten and wearing clothes and so that's not my true weight, and my real weight is probably closer to 65kg. 

However she was very alarmed, and told me that I've already gained too much weight. She said my limit for weight gain is 10kg over my pre pregnancy weight, so I should not weigh more than 73kg by the end of my pregnancy, but I am already 67kg, meaning I can only gain 6kg more. She told me if I gain more than that, I could be refused by the hospital where I am planning to give birth, and also I may have to have a c section, because apparently I will be too fat, so my birth canal will get too small.

This was terrifying to hear, as someone who has grown up in England, I'm used to hearing that you should always eat enough when pregnant (around 2000-2200 calories in the second and third trimester) so I had no idea how I'm supposed to stop myself from gaining weight. 
I asked the nurse, and she said I should only eat low calorie foods, and be careful of my salt intake.

Because of my eating disorder past, it's hard for me to understand how much food is too little/too much (i also have BPD so I struggle with very black and white thinking) and I need to understand how much I should eat in terms of calories, so I told her I will eat as healthily as I can, and around 2000 calories.
She looked alarmed again, and told me 2000 calories is way too much, and recommended I should stick to 1500 calories.

I have no choice but to follow what she told me, but for my height, 1500 calories is the amount that is recommended to lose weight, as if you are on a diet, so this made me extremely scared, seeing as I'm so used to hearing you can harm your growing baby if you diet or lose weight while pregnant. The reason I stopped restricting what I ate/fasting/purging was so that I can have a healthy pregnancy and baby, so I don't understand why I'm now being told to restrict what I eat, even though I'm at a healthy bmi.

I've seen some foreigners living in Japan who have said on forums that their baby was underweight/born prematurely because of sticking to Japan's strict pregnancy weight guidelines, so I feel confused because I want to follow what she said (to not be at risk of being rejected by the hospital) but I really don't want to risk harming my baby's growth. I can't stop thinking about it and I feel so stressed about what is the right thing to do. 

I guess this was kind of a rant, but I'd like to hear some reassurance if anyone has any experience with these weight guidelines in Japan, or if it's safe to eat 1500 calories/diet while pregnant and I'm just freaking out over nothing? Maybe english weight guidelines are too loose and Japan's strict weight guidelines are the healthier option? Any advice would be really appreciatedüòÇ",25,36,2019-09-30,premature baby,750,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,I‚Äôm struggling but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs appropriate for me to go to a NICU parents support meet-up. Thoughts?,"This is going to long and it‚Äôs rambling and I‚Äôm sorry. Please scroll down to the TL:DR if it‚Äôs too much. 

It‚Äôs been about 3.5 almost 4 months since we‚Äôve left the NICU but I‚Äôm really struggling to shake the experience. Since leaving, my son has been healthy and happy as a clam. 

Im a FTM. gave birth and soon after they took my son to the NICU to treat hypoglycaemia which was caused by medication I was prescribed during pregnancy. He was admitted for 7 nights and 8 days. Which I know, doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot of time but it felt like I was in the Twilight Zone. We stayed in a Ronald McDonald‚Äôs parents room and I refused to leave the ward for his stay. while the nurses were wonderful, I felt like I experienced more pain (emotionally) than I ever thought possible as I watched my son yo-yo as he responded to medical treatment. 

I thought that after this much time has passed that the days we spent in the NICU would have been a blur. As you all know, days and nights sorta meld together, time is irrelevant, I didn‚Äôt see the sun or go outside so,  I thought all of it would have smooshed into one giant blob of monitor beepings and nurse shift changes. Especially because 1 week is such a short time compared to what many other parents experience. 

But it didn‚Äôt. I remember everything in excruciating detail. I remember all the nurses names, I remember all the alarms I set, I remember what I ate, the baby wipe ‚Äúshowers‚Äù I took, how small my baby was, waiting by his bassinet 20 minutes before we could feed him to make sure we caught his weight and blood sugar measurements. You get the idea. 

I found a FB meet up group for parents who have children in the NICU shortly after joining this sub. It says that it‚Äôs open for both past and present NICU parents. My brother, who‚Äôs a psychiatrist and my best friend, who next to my husband, my main support during my time at the NICU however doesn‚Äôt think that this FB group is appropriate for me. He says that there are no lasting affects on my son and that I need to stop dwelling on it or it will begin to affect my mental health. Moreover, my stay was not as long or for something as serious as other parents experience and it may seem a bit insulting to them to act as if I experienced something similar. Like I said he‚Äôs in the medical profession but he‚Äôs also my big brother so I‚Äôm not really sure if this is his ‚Äúprofessional opinion‚Äù or ‚Äúbrotherly opinion‚Äù. 

I especially feel guilty because I should be over it by now. In comparison, 7 days is not long. My baby is healthy now. I see parents here who‚Äôve been in the NICU for weeks, months, with no end in sight. Parents that deal with chronically ill children. I don‚Äôt want to walk in there an act like I‚Äôm on the same level and make a fool of myself or worse, upset someone who is already going through something upsetting. At the same time, I‚Äôm hurting. I don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúget over it‚Äù I‚Äôm anxious about the prospect of a second child because how will I be able to go through that experience again? With another child at home who needs me? What if the next one stays longer? Or had a worse condition? 

TL;DR: I was only in the NICU with my son for a week for something that seems to be fairly common place. I don‚Äôt think my experience is comparable to others in the NICU but I can‚Äôt seem to get over it. Will I offend other parents by going to a FB support group meet up?",24,36,2020-01-20,emotional health,648,,,,,,,,,

NICU dr also explained that going past 34 weeks would put the baby at a higher risk of stillbirth, and delivering at 34 was not bad.

7/26/19  26 weeks, 474 grams

8/1/19  Baby has gained more than 100 grams in 2 weeks and while she is below the third percentile, her growth curve is still on par with the typical curve and as long as we are, specialist thinks we might make it to 34 weeks, but is still being cautious.

8/8/19  28 weeks and weighing 561 grams.  (For perspective, the fiftieth percentile at 28 weeks should be about 1200 grams),  We're hoping to make it to 30 weeks and gain another 150g.

8/21/19  30 weeks, measuring at 26 weeks - 701 grams.  Proportionately, everything looks good.  Specialist thinks we might be able to push delivery out to 36 weeks.

8/27/19  Weekly ultrasound checks now adds 20 minutes of being on the monitors to check for contractions and watching heart rate.

9/3/19  32 weeks, measuring at 27 weeks, 974 grams.

9/8/19  Second round of steroids

9/17/19  2lb 7oz.  Only a 5oz growth in 2 weeks. 

9/19/19  Baby has not grown enough to stay in.  Got sent to the hospital to discuss a third round of steroids and delivery options.  Because last steroids came two weeks ago, they (NICU and delivery doctor) said a third round may not necessarily be beneficial.  Baby is head down so a c-section was not needed.  We began softening the cervix and will begin Pitocin in the morning.  I can't help but feel a little disappointed that we didn't make it to at least 36 weeks.  I know making it to 34 is a huge accomplishment, but there are many things I'm missing out on now, such as the joy of being so pregnant, not being able to keep my little bun in the oven.  But as previously mentioned, the risk of her being in there vs the help we can give her out here outweighs all else.  I will provide updates after delivery and during recovery/NICU of our experience.  Thanks for reading.",23,18,2019-09-20,c-section delivery,933,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Need advice - getting over the guilt,"My daughter was born almost 2 weeks ago at 31+5. Luckily I had received steroid injections because I was at risk of preterm labor. She was only on CPAP for 1.5 days and just got moved to the step down unit from the NICU, which is awesome! The next part will just be waiting for her to be ready to eat from a bottle/breast, which we know takes time (our first was also born early, at 35+4).

However, because I now have a 4.5 year old and live further from the hospital I can‚Äôt be at the hospital as much as I wish I could. We are lucky that our hospital has cameras that allow us to watch our sweet babe when we‚Äôre not there, but it‚Äôs now causing me to feel horrible guilt. She is now awake more and any time I see her laying there awake and alone, I break down. 

Any experience/insight/thoughts into how to help get through this portion of hospitalization? I know that she‚Äôs in the best hands and I do spend as much time with her as I can, but it still feels like it‚Äôs not enough.

NICUParents,PPROM at 22+4 with di/di twins,"This morning at 5:45 am my wife bolted out of bed thinking she was peeing the bed. When she got up there was a rush of fluid that made us even more concerned. We called the 24 hour nurse who encouraged us to head into labor and delivery where the doctor confirmed that twin A‚Äôs membrane ruptured. 

My wife is having no contractions at this time which seems like the only good news. 

It seems like the plan at this time is to wait until 24 weeks and then be admitted for steroids and antibiotics, but I‚Äôm scared that this is a false hope that they only told us to avoid the hard truth. 

We were discharged with instructions to avoid exertion and monitor temperature and be very wary of any early signs of infection. 

We are terrified, we have a call scheduled with the Perinatologist in two hours but we just feel so helpless to protect our babies. 

Reading the internet tells me that the outcomes for our situation are not good. We are at a terrible risk and I‚Äôm sort of waiting for the other shoe to drop.

UPDATE:

Thank you for your replies and responses. We had a long call with our perinatal doctor and it was both informative and helpful. The outcomes are scary and we are looking at a long, hard road regardless of what happens. But I also have a lot more hope than I did when I first made this post.

The reasons for not admitting this early were as others have said, it would not demonstrably improve outcomes. We are currently in a waiting game, hoping to avoid labor and infection while we count down to viability. We have an appointment next week to meet with a neonatologist and with the perinatologist to plan our course of action.

Thank you for your thoughts and prayers and for your suggestions to seek a second opinion or go back to the hospital. I can understand where you are coming from and I appreciate that you are all looking out for my wife and my babies' best interests. As of now however we are going to wait it out at home, ready to take a trip to the ER/L&D if anything changes.

NICUParents,Daughter Born With SIE,"My daughter was born yesterday 10/26 at 12:55 am. She was twelve days overdue. The labor was long and tough on both my wife and the baby. 

During labor at some point the baby became Hypoxic which means she didn‚Äôt get enough oxygen to her brain for a period of time. When she was finally born she was almost non-responsive, hardly moving and letting out only the weakest cries. The NICU who was already in the room due to meconium concerns got to work immediately and then transferred her upstairs to the NICU.

Within 20 minutes her Apgar score had gone from a two to a five which showed some improvement but not enough for them to like it. They decided that the best course of action was to transfer her to a level one NICU. Luckily we have one about twenty minutes away and it is considered one of the best NICU in New York State. 

She‚Äôs been placed in a treatment called Therapeutic Hypothermia which does a lot of things but mostly improves her blood gas but also limits swelling and other damage from her brain injury due to lack of oxygen. 

She‚Äôs continuing to improve but they are concerned that her EEG is showing signs of seizure like activity at times. They are monitoring it heavily and are going to do an MRI as soon as they can safely do so. 

I got to visit her and she‚Äôs crying really loudly now and moving a lot. She opened her eyes and looked at me and I was able to sooth her a bit. She‚Äôs already way better than she was so I‚Äôm optimistic this is the right way to help her. 

It‚Äôs been a tough couple of days so far. Mom is still in the hospital due to pre-eclampsia like symptoms post partum. So I left the delivery hospital without my wife and without my daughter. That was one of the toughest moments of my life. 

We haven‚Äôt been able to hold our daughter since she was born. My wife saw her for maybe ten minutes before they transferred her to the other NICU. I‚Äôve visited and spent a few hours with her but I cannot imagine my wife‚Äôs pain at not having her baby and not breastfeeding her. 

It‚Äôs tough and we don‚Äôt know how my daughter will be long term but we decided last night we are ready for it no matter what. We‚Äôre just going to take it a day at a time. 

The good news is my wife is being discharged today and we‚Äôll both be able to see our daughter together.

NICUParents,I‚Äôm struggling but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs appropriate for me to go to a NICU parents support meet-up. Thoughts?,"This is going to long and it‚Äôs rambling and I‚Äôm sorry. Please scroll down to the TL:DR if it‚Äôs too much. 

It‚Äôs been about 3.5 almost 4 months since we‚Äôve left the NICU but I‚Äôm really struggling to shake the experience. Since leaving, my son has been healthy and happy as a clam. 

Im a FTM. gave birth and soon after they took my son to the NICU to treat hypoglycaemia which was caused by medication I was prescribed during pregnancy. He was admitted for 7 nights and 8 days. Which I know, doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot of time but it felt like I was in the Twilight Zone. We stayed in a Ronald McDonald‚Äôs parents room and I refused to leave the ward for his stay. while the nurses were wonderful, I felt like I experienced more pain (emotionally) than I ever thought possible as I watched my son yo-yo as he responded to medical treatment. 

I thought that after this much time has passed that the days we spent in the NICU would have been a blur. As you all know, days and nights sorta meld together, time is irrelevant, I didn‚Äôt see the sun or go outside so,  I thought all of it would have smooshed into one giant blob of monitor beepings and nurse shift changes. Especially because 1 week is such a short time compared to what many other parents experience. 

But it didn‚Äôt. I remember everything in excruciating detail. I remember all the nurses names, I remember all the alarms I set, I remember what I ate, the baby wipe ‚Äúshowers‚Äù I took, how small my baby was, waiting by his bassinet 20 minutes before we could feed him to make sure we caught his weight and blood sugar measurements. You get the idea. 

I found a FB meet up group for parents who have children in the NICU shortly after joining this sub. It says that it‚Äôs open for both past and present NICU parents. My brother, who‚Äôs a psychiatrist and my best friend, who next to my husband, my main support during my time at the NICU however doesn‚Äôt think that this FB group is appropriate for me. He says that there are no lasting affects on my son and that I need to stop dwelling on it or it will begin to affect my mental health. Moreover, my stay was not as long or for something as serious as other parents experience and it may seem a bit insulting to them to act as if I experienced something similar. Like I said he‚Äôs in the medical profession but he‚Äôs also my big brother so I‚Äôm not really sure if this is his ‚Äúprofessional opinion‚Äù or ‚Äúbrotherly opinion‚Äù. 

I especially feel guilty because I should be over it by now. In comparison, 7 days is not long. My baby is healthy now. I see parents here who‚Äôve been in the NICU for weeks, months, with no end in sight. Parents that deal with chronically ill children. I don‚Äôt want to walk in there an act like I‚Äôm on the same level and make a fool of myself or worse, upset someone who is already going through something upsetting. At the same time, I‚Äôm hurting. I don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúget over it‚Äù I‚Äôm anxious about the prospect of a second child because how will I be able to go through that experience again? With another child at home who needs me? What if the next one stays longer? Or had a worse condition? 

TL;DR: I was only in the NICU with my son for a week for something that seems to be fairly common place. I don‚Äôt think my experience is comparable to others in the NICU but I can‚Äôt seem to get over it. Will I offend other parents by going to a FB support group meet up?",22,36,2020-01-20,mental health during pregnancy,648,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,IUGR: Requesting Insight from Others,"Hello NICUParents,

Lots of text, TLDR at the bottom. 

Currently in the middle of mentally processing a recent IUGR diagnosis at 24+6. I'm hoping to get some perspective from those who have been where we are.

Wife had ""unexplained elevated MSAFP"" at about 12 or so weeks, I can't remember.

After that discovery, we had a battery of several tests. We were negative for spina bifida. Our trisomy screens returned normal and were told we are low risk for chromosomal abnormalities. No abnormal nuchal translucency, and no neural tube or abdominal wall defects. Ultrasounds regarding anatomy and visible organ function/development have all appeared normal per MFM staff, aside from baby measuring 2 weeks behind where she should be.

Doctor did mention elevated umbilical dopplers that are worthy of additional observation, but there was still blood flow and there wasn't any backflow. My wife is on a preemptive aspirin and bedrest protocol, but has not officially declared preeclamptic. She has a family history of diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, but is negative for those things herself. 

Baby has remained physically active without issue. We feel her move and kick daily, and she was even moving for us on screen today. The geneticist at our MFM clinic told us that (thus far) due to a lack of observable anomalies on ultrasound, she is leaning more toward a placental issue than chromosomal abnormality.

Even so, my wife and I are still worried to death that something detrimental to our little one's health is hiding under the surface. It has been a very stressful, trying time. We are aware that an early delivery and NICU stay are highly likely, and we are fine with that, as long as she is okay. 

TLDR: For those of you who have had an IUGR baby, were they healthy otherwise, despite their growth restriction? Or did you have other diagnoses alongside the growth restriction?

Thank you for your time and insight.",22,23,2019-12-27,early delivery,323,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,Constant Anxiety,"I was induced at 37 weeks, and our baby spent the first week of her life in the NICU. I know that so many parents have a much harder and longer stay than ours and my heart goes out to all of you. I had a really hard time during pregnancy, then my delivery was 3 days, and then she was taken to the NICU. 
Our baby has been home for 3 weeks now. She is still on oxygen, and is doing well, but I‚Äôm not. 
I feel so overwhelmed by anxiety and fear that something bad will happen to her I‚Äôm losing sleep and I think I‚Äôm exhausting my husband. I‚Äôm trying to stay calm and focus on the positives but any thought of having to take her into a hospital stops my heart. I blame myself constantly for everything. 
Because she was in the NICU breastfeeding has been difficult. I mostly bottle feed formula with some breast milk. 
I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm anxious. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm guilty. And I‚Äôm missing out on the joys of being a family because of it.

NICUParents,Do IUGR babies tend to do worse when born early?,"Hi again everyone. I asked something similar the other day but just feel as though I need to arm myself with more info.

I‚Äôm in hospital yet again due to contractions. So far only every 15 minutes and docs aren‚Äôt sure if it is my bowels playing around (I suffer from IBS and the pain sometimes resembles contractions but we cannot take any chances with recent events). I‚Äôm pretty sure it won‚Äôt be long now until baby makes his appearance, sadly I am only 25 weeks and 4 days. I‚Äôm grateful however that we made it this far - I was previously told I‚Äôd deliver at 23 weeks and 4 days. 

A few days ago, we had a growth scan and boy was measuring about 7 days behind where he should be. He was in the 50th percentile for a baby at 24 weeks, and the 17-20th percentile for a baby of his age (25 weeks)

They couldn‚Äôt tell me why. My placenta function is normal. It‚Äôs all been very worrying.

Husband and I were disheartened as we always assumed if we got to 25 weeks he‚Äôd have a better chance. In the leaflet our NICU gave us, they state most babies born after 25 weeks survive if they have had magnesium and steroids. He has had both (currently at it with the magnesium anyway)

I was then told by a pretty unsupportive family member yesterday (who has had three full term babies) that because our boy technically isn‚Äôt the size of a 25 weeker his chances are lower. However, I‚Äôve read a few comments on this subreddit and google where preemie parents have been told its more gestational age that matters rather than baby‚Äôs measurements on percentile charts from ultrasounds. I actually spoke to one mom who said that preemies who are small for gestational age have usually put their energy more towards organ development so they often fair well.

Little dude has definitely been in there for 25 weeks and 4 days. We can‚Äôt explain his small size away by confused conception dates because he is an IVF baby.

Fairly traumatic back labour (no time between contractions, most with double peaks) with a half failed epidural at 7cm (didnt stop any back pains)  and an emergency section (baby in distress after being vacuumed to change position), all 40 hours after my water broke and with an induction half way through. 

Very relieved when the c section was performed and baby arrived husband had a very traumatic time and I definitely credit my ability to cope during and after to the hypnobirthing knowledge I had researched.

Found out my husband [30M] has been seeing prostitutes during my [27F] entire pregnancy and baby‚Äôs NICU stay.,"I really just want to talk to someone and vent because I‚Äôm feeling so broken and alone. My husband is the most perfect man on the surface, even my dad who is a psychologist didn‚Äôt see through him. But I think he‚Äôs a sociopath. I had the worst pregnancy of all time, I lost 30 pounds because id throw up even from drinking water. 2 months into it, My best friend died an unexpected and particularly gruesome/preventable death two days after my birthday. I found out that two days after her death, he made a bunch of affair profiles. My baby came 4 months early at only 1 lb and was only given a 50/50 chance to live. The whole time we were in the NICU my husband was going to see prostitutes, some of whom he knew were trafficking victims/had been drugged. He‚Äôs been to multiple massage parlors for happy endings and has talked with multiple women he‚Äôs met online. I confronted him on it and he‚Äôs still doing that stuff but just more sneakily thinking I don‚Äôt know. He left my baby alone at the house to go buy MDMA from his drug dealer and spend $1000 which was supposed to be for baby‚Äôs medical bills on a prostitute one night when I offered to watch the baby for him so he could go to a friends house. My baby is very medically needy being that he‚Äôs premature, he‚Äôs hooked up to a lot of machinery and he‚Äôs immuneocompromised so I can‚Äôt just take him and leave. I‚Äôm living in a different country so I can‚Äôt just drive to someone I know. I‚Äôm completely alone here with this sociopath and a sick baby. I‚Äôm dying mentally having to be around him, he made me fall so in love and give him a baby just to destroy me like this. The only thing keeping me from just killing myself are my elderly parents and baby. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I dint think there‚Äôs anything I can do since baby‚Äôs sick and will be hooked up to machines for the foreseeable future. So I‚Äôm stuck in this house, in a sexless marriage, being cheated on and disrespected constantly, neglected and left to watch this baby alone all day. No job (can‚Äôt drive), no friends, no family. Alone :( I‚Äôm sorry this isn‚Äôt very coherent but I really feel like I‚Äôm falling apart and I just need someone to hear me.

TLDR: can‚Äôt leave my sociopath cheating husband because I have a very sick child hooked up to machinery. Living in a different country with no family or friends.

My MD suggested I ask people who have done it both ways and ask what the preference was, in terms of recovery or anything else that comes to mind.

Update: to be very clear I‚Äôm asking for points of view ONLY from people who have had BOTH a csection and a vaginal delivery. If you had one and enjoyed it then that‚Äôs great but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm asking for. Thank you",17,28,2020-03-30,c-section delivery,134,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,How long did you have to wait ‚Äòtill you could hold/touch your baby?,"My wife is currently pregnant with our first. She also was diagnosed with cancer again about 6 weeks ago. Because of this, our baby is going to be born at 28-30 weeks. I‚Äôve been finding it tough figuring out how long we‚Äôll have to wait to touch/hold him, so I thought you guys could help me out with some anecdotal evidence? Obviously a lot can change due to complications but I want to have a ballpark figure to aim for. Cheers",16,69,2019-10-17,weeks pregnant,81,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,Told to expect a premature baby and he is already smaller than he should be,"Hi everyone. I don‚Äôt know where else to post or if I should post here but cautious baby bumps forwarded me to this subreddit.

I‚Äôm currently 25 weeks pregnant with my first baby who was conceived via IVF after years of trying. I‚Äôm only 23 years old.

8 days ago, I was having abdominal pain and tightening so headed to labour and delivery. They noted my cervix was closed, however a test they ran came back highly suggestive for preterm labour. They kept me in hospital for a week, giving me steroids for baby‚Äôs lungs and monitoring me and I was allowed to come home 2 days ago. 

Today I went for a growth scan and was sadly told baby is only measuring at 23 weeks and 5 days. He also only weighs around 660 grams. At 25 weeks they would expect him to be weighing more.

My OBGYN told me that in ‚Äònormal‚Äô circumstances my pregnancy wouldn‚Äôt be too worrying and I‚Äôd likely just have a small baby at term, but because he is expected early it is now worrying. 

Another preterm labour test was run and again came back positive. It‚Äôs likely I will go into labour within the next week or two if the test wasn‚Äôt wrong. I have been told I can have magnesium sulphate if I go into active labour. I‚Äôm constantly in pain abdominally but nobody really knows why, so this is just treated with pain killers.

Has anyone got any words of hope at all for me? I‚Äôm heartbroken. I saw 25 weeks as such a milestone as I was told most preemies do well after 25 weeks but my little boy isn‚Äôt measuring at 25 weeks at all especially with a low weight of 660g.

I hope I‚Äôm in the right place.

BabyBumps,Depression during pregnancy,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety before pregnancy. Was on medication and saw a therapist. Now that I‚Äôm pregnant I still see the therapist, but am off my medication. The first trimester was great. I‚Äôm 17 weeks now and for the past month or so have had weekly suicidal thoughts. I would never do anything because I would never hurt this baby, but they‚Äôre still there.

I don‚Äôt think about how I would do it like I used to think (again, my mind protecting my baby I think). I just think about how my world would be easier/less painful if I weren‚Äôt here.

I feel very, very lonely right now. On top of it all, my husband may get a specialized residency in another city. This means packing up, moving, starting all over, getting a new teaching job in a new district (which is so hard, I‚Äôve done it before). Making new friends. All with a newborn. The thought makes me sick and makes me not want to be here even more. It would be easier if I weren‚Äôt here.

NICUParents,35 Weeker Still on O2 at 12 Weeks,"Hi, everyone.  I‚Äôm new to this sub but I am hoping to get some feedback on my son‚Äôs situation.  He was born at 35+3 after I developed severe preeclampsia and was kept in the NICU for 12 hours after birth but did not require any intervention at that time.  He was discharged from the hospital on day 2 of life but then readmitted on day 4 due to jaundice.  At that time, he was put on O2 because they noticed he would occasionally desat to the low 80s.  The staff said that this was not uncommon, both because he was early and because we live at 5,500 feet above sea level.  They did a chest x-day while he was there and saw nothing abnormal or concerning.

He was discharged again on day 6 and sent home with O2 (setting on portable tank is 1/16, which I think corresponds to 0.06 L/min?).  He failed his overnight pulse ox study at 4 weeks with sats below 88 35% of the time.  Then he failed another overnight pulse ox study at 8 weeks with sats below 88 13% of the time.  He did another study last week at 11 weeks - we are waiting for the results, but both my husband and I saw sats in the low 80s on the monitor so we‚Äôre thinking he failed this one too.

We are concerned that he is still on O2 nearly three months after birth, and we feel bad because we don‚Äôt really take him anywhere very often because of the hassle of the tank and because his whole life, he‚Äôs had a cannula up his nose and stuck to his face.  His pediatrician said that it‚Äôs okay he‚Äôs still on O2 but we are wondering when he will be able to get off of it.  (I should add that, thankfully, he has had no other health issues other than the jaundice since he was born, and that resolved pretty quickly after light therapy was initiated.)

Has anyone here had a similar experience?  How long did it take for your baby of similar gestational age to get off oxygen and did that process involve weaning?  Should we be concerned about lung issues since it‚Äôs taking him longer than expected to be off O2?  I would really appreciate any feedback - thanks so much!

Edited to add:  I did get two doses of steroids in the hospital before he was born.",14,20,2019-12-18,gestational age,406,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,Meconium & prolapsed cord. I just need to tell someone.,"I‚Äôm so sad to have to be writing this. I don‚Äôt know anyone else personally whose has had a baby in the NICU. 

My pregnancy was perfect. I had absolutely no complications. He was scheduled for an induction a few days early at 40+5. My doctor asked if I wanted to wait till week 41 or go early. I‚Äôve been so worried that pregnancy, my second, and asked if I could come a few days earlier. I‚Äôm so grateful that I did now. 

They were supposed to give me a foley bulb, but instead I received what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúcook‚Äù? And told to come back in 24hrs, 7pm on Monday. I was having intense contractions all night into the next day.. when we got to the hospital I was in so, so much pain and having intense back labor. 

They checked me and found I was 8cm. 

His heart kept dropping and the doctor, who I hadn‚Äôt met her, explained she was so concerned about him fluctuating she came as soon as she finished two other deliveries. She checked me and broke my waters, where they found so, so much meconium. She came back after my epidural to see if she could flush me out with what looked like saline? But when she felt again she felt his cord and immediately told the nurses, ‚ÄúProlapsed cord,‚Äù and I started to cry. I knew what that meant. My husband had no clue, he was so confused. 

They told me I had to have an immediate c-section and I cried the whole way there. I had the sweetest nurse my entire time. She was wonderful. 

He was born at 10:22pm on 4/20. I saw him for maybe 5-10 seconds before he was taken away. They gave me a stronger dose of medicine with my epidural that put me to sleep while they cleaned me. 

I was taken to a room with a lot of empty beds and the nurse eventually called for my husband. He was crying. This is the second time in my life I‚Äôve ever seen him cry. The doctor had explained to him because of the distress myself & him were in, they were concerned for his lack of oxygen, which was borderline. They took out so much meconium from his body. 

They told us he would be using a cooling vest, where he is now. They told us the concern was his body would try to produce too much oxygen too fast and cause a fever and/or seizures. We‚Äôre so grateful he‚Äôs stabilized. He hasn‚Äôt had any seizures and even though he‚Äôs still on oxygen, he‚Äôs doing okay. 

My husband and I cope differently. I know he believes I should be there every hour of every day. They‚Äôre only letting one parent in and we agreed it would be me. But every time I go to see him, I cry. I‚Äôm so happy he‚Äôs okay. But I can‚Äôt stop crying for so many reasons. I cry because he‚Äôs okay, but so uncomfortable. I cry when he cries that I can‚Äôt hold him and worry he‚Äôll think no one cares and will come help him. Everyone has said it‚Äôs not my fault, but I still place the blame on myself somehow. 

The doctor was so kind. She did express that she truly felt if we had waited until his exact 41w and then some for a later induction, he might not have been okay. In her words, ‚ÄúI truly believe we would‚Äôve had a different outcome.‚Äù She told me they wouldn‚Äôt have let me get so far in my pregnancy if everything hadn‚Äôt been going so well. 

He was in a ‚Äúsunny side up‚Äù position and his head was more to my right side instead of straight down, allowing the cord to slip past him first. It was also the reason I was having such severe back labor.

BabyBumps,Small for gestational age on ultrasound.,"FTM here 32w0d today and I just had an ultrasound yesterday to check baby's size as I measured small at my last midwife appointment.  Overall, the ultrasound was ""reassuring"" (radiologist's words), showing that baby is in 25th percentile for growth but with a small abdomen.  I'm reviewing the ultrasound results again this morning and it shows that baby's abdominal circumference is in the <5th percentile range, which really doesn't sound that good to me.  A small amount of research this morning indicates that the low abdominal circumference can be associated with poor outcomes like preterm labor and low Apgar scores.  

So all this leaves me a little worried.  The best thing I can think to do is increase my calorie and protein intake.  Do any other low birth weight moms have some good hacks?  I'm planning to make more smoothies and also to try and eat more nutrient-dense, smaller meals throughout the day.  Advice/encouragement appreciated.

On a little more emotional note, I'm feeling guilty about all this.  I am a small person, BMI was <18 when we got pregnant although I had been trying to increase it.  During the course of this pregnancy, my husband and I sold our house, bought a new house, moved, and I also started a new job.  I think with all the other stressors I didn't focus on nutrition and supplementation as much as I could have.  I have only gained about 10 pounds so far.  My husband is extremely worried about the low birth weight results and, while he is generally a very supportive partner, his anxiety about this is making me feel even worse.  Basically, mom guilt has kicked in with a vengeance.",13,11,2019-11-21,gestational age,280,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,Experience on when to get corticosteroid shots?,The doctors don't recommend getting the corticosteroids until week 24. We talked them down to 23 & 5. They said it won't work until week 24. Today I was feeling really anxious about not making it until then and started researching about the shots. According to ACOG you can give the shots as early as 23 weeks. One study showed it dropped mortality rates from 73.5% to 59.1% in week 23. My husband wants to wait until the 23 & 5 but my anxiety (intuition?) is wanting to do it ASAP. Does anybody have any experience getting the shots that early? I am 23 weeks exactly today. I know the shots don't work well if given too early but if I go into labor before the shots the chance of survival is so low. I'm so scared of making the wrong decision.,12,11,2020-02-20,early labor,142,,,,,,,,,

I am having a complicated pregnancy and have been told to go immediately to the hospital if my water breaks (polyhydramnios, ventriculomegaly, preterm labour, GBS pos), so we are in a pickle.

Obviously, daddy is going to drive me to the hospital. Once he does that, should he leave me and take our kid back home?

BabyBumps,How to deal with constant anxiety throughout pregnancy?,"I am currently 13 weeks pregnant with our first baby boy and my fiance and I are so excited! We had to postpone our wedding due to the coronavirus so finding out we were expecting has really been a silver lining for us through all the wedding stress. The problem is, I have had crippling anxiety throughout my whole pregnancy since the day I found out. Although I love reddit and find it to be super helpful I also found that during pregnancy it can be a dark hole. I am constantly reading terrifying stories of women miscarrying, etc and it only fuels my anxiety. Everyday I am afraid the baby has passed and I just don't know it yet. 

All my ultrasounds have been great, baby is growing on track and heartbeat is always strong. Our NIPT can back low risk for everything (that a NIPT tests for) and our NT scan was great, baby looked healthy and normal. But still, everyday I fear I will miscarry or that something is seriously wrong with my baby.

I find myself literally spending hours on the internet sometimes researching very rare complications that can occur during pregnancy and convince myself that it will happen to me. 

Now that i've passed my NT scan I am terrified that at my anatomy scan that we will find something horribly wrong about the baby and I cant stop thinking about it. 

Anyways, I guess i'm wondering, have other future mommas felt this way and how did you deal? Am i ever in the clear to feel excited and attached to my baby? Do all signs point to me having a healthy baby boy in October?

NICUParents,Meconium & prolapsed cord. I just need to tell someone.,"I‚Äôm so sad to have to be writing this. I don‚Äôt know anyone else personally whose has had a baby in the NICU. 

My pregnancy was perfect. I had absolutely no complications. He was scheduled for an induction a few days early at 40+5. My doctor asked if I wanted to wait till week 41 or go early. I‚Äôve been so worried that pregnancy, my second, and asked if I could come a few days earlier. I‚Äôm so grateful that I did now. 

They were supposed to give me a foley bulb, but instead I received what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúcook‚Äù? And told to come back in 24hrs, 7pm on Monday. I was having intense contractions all night into the next day.. when we got to the hospital I was in so, so much pain and having intense back labor. 

They checked me and found I was 8cm. 

His heart kept dropping and the doctor, who I hadn‚Äôt met her, explained she was so concerned about him fluctuating she came as soon as she finished two other deliveries. She checked me and broke my waters, where they found so, so much meconium. She came back after my epidural to see if she could flush me out with what looked like saline? But when she felt again she felt his cord and immediately told the nurses, ‚ÄúProlapsed cord,‚Äù and I started to cry. I knew what that meant. My husband had no clue, he was so confused. 

They told me I had to have an immediate c-section and I cried the whole way there. I had the sweetest nurse my entire time. She was wonderful. 

He was born at 10:22pm on 4/20. I saw him for maybe 5-10 seconds before he was taken away. They gave me a stronger dose of medicine with my epidural that put me to sleep while they cleaned me. 

I was taken to a room with a lot of empty beds and the nurse eventually called for my husband. He was crying. This is the second time in my life I‚Äôve ever seen him cry. The doctor had explained to him because of the distress myself & him were in, they were concerned for his lack of oxygen, which was borderline. They took out so much meconium from his body. 

They told us he would be using a cooling vest, where he is now. They told us the concern was his body would try to produce too much oxygen too fast and cause a fever and/or seizures. We‚Äôre so grateful he‚Äôs stabilized. He hasn‚Äôt had any seizures and even though he‚Äôs still on oxygen, he‚Äôs doing okay. 

My husband and I cope differently. I know he believes I should be there every hour of every day. They‚Äôre only letting one parent in and we agreed it would be me. But every time I go to see him, I cry. I‚Äôm so happy he‚Äôs okay. But I can‚Äôt stop crying for so many reasons. I cry because he‚Äôs okay, but so uncomfortable. I cry when he cries that I can‚Äôt hold him and worry he‚Äôll think no one cares and will come help him. Everyone has said it‚Äôs not my fault, but I still place the blame on myself somehow. 

The doctor was so kind. She did express that she truly felt if we had waited until his exact 41w and then some for a later induction, he might not have been okay. In her words, ‚ÄúI truly believe we would‚Äôve had a different outcome.‚Äù She told me they wouldn‚Äôt have let me get so far in my pregnancy if everything hadn‚Äôt been going so well. 

He was in a ‚Äúsunny side up‚Äù position and his head was more to my right side instead of straight down, allowing the cord to slip past him first. It was also the reason I was having such severe back labor.

BabyBumps,Working moms - how do you get through first trimester morning sickness?,"I'm a STM (7 weeks atm) struggling with severe nausea throughout the day and night. I know I should be thankful that I don't have hyperemesis (persistant vomiting) like some moms have, but I just wanted to know how other working moms coped through the first trimester as I literally battle to get any work done.

Often I have to sit next to the toilet for periods of time because I'm on the verge of throwing up, and even if it's not that bad it's enough to make focusing on work really difficult. Being in a male-run corporate environment there is little understanding for what women go through during pregnancy. I don't even know if I would be allowed to use my sick leave for this, but I feel so sick all the time. I'm so behind in my work and also don't have the energy to work through the night to make it up. Anyone else in the same boat or have some advice?  


I think it may be due to the prenatal vitamins as well because I switched to taking them at night thinking that would be better and I woke up 30 min after taking them with the worst nausea I've experienced so far. It probably also doesn't help that due to the nausea I'm eating like a cracker here and there - can't stomach dinner or proper food that my hubby cooks.",11,25,2020-02-04,coping during pregnancy,236,,,,,,,,,

BabyBumps,Old wives tales to induce labor or help it along?,"Alrighty ladies and gents! I've been 'in labor' (dialated to at least a two, lost mucous plug, no bloody show though) for two weeks now.

After I sat straight up for 10 minutes they went away (laying down and walking didn't work). Now I'm done. I want him out. I never went into natural labor with my first, he was induced from start to finish, so all this is new. I want the waiting to stop.

AskDocs,Lung Pain From Vaping THC,"I made a long post here explaining my situation but it's a bit of an essay so I'll boil it down here.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/da3ppe/vaping\_case\_present/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/da3ppe/vaping_case_present/)

I acquired a medical marijuana license for my Lyme disease as it proved incredibly beneficial for my inability to conceptualize things with my brain fog. I then proceeded to vaping dry herb and concentrates as I was told it was the healthiest inhalation method. As a medical user, I'd only use it a few times a day.. although the dry herb vape can make a small bowl last for 15 minutes so it yielded a lot of inhales. I did my research ahead of time to ensure I was buying the most health conscious herb vape exclusively composed of borosilicate glass in air paths and stainless steel/borosilicate glass in the heating chamber. (FYI: I've since found the right doc for Lyme and doing much better so you can disregard it. Any symptoms I list relating to Lyme have since gone away).

Anyways, 9 months later I go from someone with incredible cardio, even when out of shape, to chronic cigarette smoker cardio in my early 20s. Things suddenly got really bad about 3 weeks ago which made me aware of my lung damage. As mentioned in other post, I had persisting pain in upper left lung for awhile actually. I assumed it was a symptom of Lyme as one of my many symptoms over the years was heart palpitation and occasional sharp chest pains. I don't have much money but had an appt lined up to see a heart doctor per my Lyme doc's recommendations. I came to the realization that it was my lungs after about 3 days of very labored breathing, some coughs where I felt things clearing (mucus I assume), then finally, the same pain went to my right side. The last one made it clear for me.

It's been 3 weeks since and things have progressed but I worry that the damage will lead to scarring and permanent damage. My goal of course would be to achieve minimal permanent damage and I assume that'll require more than just letting my body heal.

Is there any natural way I might counteract this and aid in promoting optimal healing? Perhaps even stem cells sprayed on my lungs?

Things I'm doing: I‚Äôve used eucalyptus essential oils in diffuser while varying between 1:2 and normal breathing 2-3 times weekly. It offered a lot of relief the first session when my lungs were surely at maximum inflammation and mucus. Using YMCA steam room twice a week. Been on a therapeutic keto and doing prolonged and intermittent fasting for 5+ months for Lyme; should conveniently prove beneficial in the healing process as it's a very clean, minimalist, no nonsense diet unlike most keto-goers doing it for weight loss. I typically exercise 4-5 times a week but had to slow things down the last 3 weeks. I've tried pushing my cardio twice in the last week but it sucks.

I greatly appreciate any constructive advice as I feel like I should be doing more. Criticism on the other hand for not self-diagnosing quicker w/my symptoms will only make a sad boy sadder. I've kicked myself enough over it. Eek, so much for boiling down my essay hah. Thank you for your time.

Edit: I immediately quit any forms of smoke or vape inhalation following initiation of mimicking pain in right lung. It's unlikely that I'll ever intentionally inhale smoke or vapor again.",11,23,2019-10-02,early labor,582,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,"Seeking advice/experience from fellow NICU parents or those in the ‚Äòknow‚Äô on Breast Milk supply while in NICU vs near Due date, random GA question, length on stay, and IUGR","So question for y‚Äôall...I had twins on 08/31 at 29+6...Currently, on day 20 at the NICU 

First, is it a faux pas just to say my boys were born at 30 weeks instead of 29+6? Albeit, even its just for my own peace of mind. 

Second Breast milk supply question..
So I read that having a baby, or in my case babies, in the NICU can initially have a negative effect on BM supply. I reckoned it‚Äôs basically bc a pump doesn‚Äôt have the BM stimulation mojo that babies possess...I‚Äôve also heard that some moms with an initial low supply magically get a boost as they near their original due date.  So have any of you initially started out with a less than robust BM supply while babies were in the NICU and the suddenly your bottle(s) overfloweth with boobie juice once you get around your due date?  Or is that just breast milk urban legend?

Third, twin A is crushing it so far, but twin B (the smaller one) is lagging somewhat behind.  Even though it‚Äôs expected bc he came into to the world smaller and had placenta/cord issues while in utero (IUGR).  So far both had good results on the their head/cranial ultrasounds, both had a Apgar score of 8/8, both are off their CPAP, both have had PICC lines removed, but twin B isn‚Äôt gaining weight at the rate twin A is.  Twin A was born weighing 3lbs and 1oz (now weighing 3lbs and 11oz) and twin B was born weighing 1lbs and 14oz (now weighing 2lbs and 6oz).  Also, while twin A is on the verge of being moved to an open crib, off his nasal cannula, and possibly starting to take a bottle sometime I the next week or so....his brother is still on a nasal cannula and hasn‚Äôt gotten out of the acute section the NICU.  So I say all that to say this...Has anyone had a similar circumstance with twins and if so how long was your NICU stay? And if one twin cane home before the other what was the difference? And did you find that once your twins were together again it made their progress improved exponentially? 

Fourth, if you‚Äôve had one twin with IUGR and the other one without or if you had one baby with IUGR...Have you read/heard anything that would suggest a link  between a bay being diagnosed with IUGR and a slower neonatal weight gain compared to a preemie born at a low birth weight but not due to IUGR?",10,9,2019-09-20,NICU stay,423,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,I barely know what life is anymore,"I barely know what life is anymore .  Im drained almost hopeless anxious exhaudted and just devastated and numb.  From the start I had a difficult pregnancy but the babies were fine until my body betrayed all 3 of us and my cervix began shortening. I gave birth at 32&2 and  that was a critical situation which affected my daughter most. Her twin brother was off oxygen within 2 days and just growing and feeding learning to regulate his temp. My daughter, took a week in a half to be off oxygen began growing and feeding and then started declining again. Desats to the 20s 30s 40s 50s ..the 70s on a good day. First it was with feeds then came bradys. Then they werent associated with feeds and she was diagnosed with the flu at 35 &5 . My son has tested negative but we are all on meds. 

I just don't  understand why this is happening , I cant wven be there to hold my sick baby that much because I have to care for her twin and ensure his health as well. 

Im terrified she wont  be able to fight it off, the affects  on her body ..it feels like the day I will have toddlers will never come. 
 I feel guilty  for the skin to skin and love my son gets at home and my hesrt is only half way in it because all I think of is my ooor sick baby alone  not being held or comforted just  fed and put back. 

How do you begin to cope with this life? Almost a month old and she hasnt been able to have the life I want to give her  the love I want to provide to her and I can only do so much while shes there..even more so now because I have to wear gloves a gown a mask..I cant even kiss my baby right now when she is her sickest .

On Tuesday, I took a pregnancy at home. Test was positive. Scheduled ob appointment on Sept 10. Wednesday, I had cramping with no spotting. Thursday, I continued to cramp and went to the ER to be checked. My hcg level was 350. My ultrasound results were put as: ‚ÄúPossible 3 mm intrauterine gestational sac near the fundal portion of the endometrium without definite fetal pole or yolk sac. Differential possibilities would include early gestation, nonviable pregnancy versus non visualized ectopic pregnancy. Recommend continued biochemical and sonographic follow up. A small amount of free pelvic fluid may be physiologic. Heterogeneous mixed echogenicity 2.2 cm nodular structure with some peripheral blood flow in the left ovary may represent a corpus luteal cyst.‚Äù
Saturday morning, I had my hcg drawn again and the level was 434, which is about a 28% raise in around 42 hours. I‚Äôm still having back pains and slight cramping along with feeling lightheaded and winded easily. I still have not had any bleeding or cramping. Just recurrent diarrhea. I‚Äôm unsure if I should be more worried about a possible ectopic and should get checked again, or if my doctors office would have already called me if my blood levels/symptoms were warning signs to them.

NICUParents,A year later and what I wish the Nicu parents and nurses knew!,"Hello Nicu parents/ Nicu nurses. I was told about this group over a year ago when my twins were born at 26 weeks. This group has helped me really not feel alone in the process. My twins did very well and they are now happy healthy one year olds with no long term issues. As I look back around this year mark I am reminded how emotionally challenging it all was, all 100 plus days of it. I am also a therapist and have tried to look at this experience from that lens too. 

I want to start off by saying Nicu nurses are absolutely amazing. I am still friends with some and they genuinely still care so much about my twins. The nicu is a special place where you spend so much time with these nurses that they have an unintentional emotional support role, especially in higher level Nicus.

I wanted to provide some feedback from the therapist side of things on what I felt could have been helpful during such a dark time in my life. I‚Äôve seen on here when a parent vocalizes anger about the nicu there usually is an amazing nurse commenting to explain why this thing happened. As kind as this is it also reads as minimizing that parents emotions. We are so angry, our lives are falling apart and we are grieving a healthy pregnancy, a healthy child and a life that we were promised. Most of us never thought we‚Äôd be in this place. And as much as your logic is well intentioned for most of us we can‚Äôt compute logic. We are in survival mode and just need empathy a simple ‚Äúwow that sucks and must be hard‚Äù. And it‚Äôs definitely not a NICU nurses job to provide emotional support as you guys do so many other things. I guess I just want to recommend if someone is falling apart because their child backslide, don‚Äôt always meet this with ration. Try empathy or nothing. Sadly, telling us ‚Äúthis is normal‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs better for the baby‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help us in the moment. We are shattering over and over again each day and as logical as I am about emotions I never wanted logic. I just wanted to be a human suffering. 

My hope here is not to pass judgement but to alleviate the pressure on the nurse to emotionally fix us. We can‚Äôt be fixed, not until that baby is hope and we process this trauma. And we‚Äôll never truly go ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù Also to parents, get therapy. My husband both went this route and I can imagine it softened the pain a bit and helped us probably save our marriage from the mounting pressure of a nicu stay.

NICUParents,Oxygen in the NICU,"I was told to come here so here I am!

Beautiful healthy baby boy was born on the 19th. 41 weeks, not preemie. 

He was doing fine till the next day, he apparently aspirated during birth and needed antibiotics and oxygen.


Hes doing well. His last day for meds is today. Hes gaining weight, eats and poops and burps like a champ.

But his oxygen levels have stayed roughly the same all week and I'm a little sad. I was hoping he would be weaned off oxygen at the same time and come home this weekend. 

But hes still at 45% oxygen and 1.5. He sometimes can handle 40% for a while (longest was 3 hours) but then he needs to be bumped up again. 

Xrays say nothing is wrong with his heart or lungs, he just needs more time to get his lungs stronger.

Anyone else been in the same boat? I'm just sad today and a little scared he will never get better.

Update: they suspect it might be acid reflux so they're keeping him a little tilted upright in his sleeping bin to see how that goes. Any experience with that?",9,7,2019-09-28,full term birth,194,,,,,,,,,

Apologies for grammar. This is hard to type on my phone.

My wife, other than being overweight, was perfectly healthy 4 years ago. She got pregnant with our daughter and everything started out fine. About 4 months before out daughter was born, she started developing problems with her teeth. Molars started cracking and breaking off and jaw pain slowly set in. The dentist did what they could while she was pregnant.

She had issues during the delivery. She started experiencing major neck and shoulder pain. Her jaw pain got worse. Both wife and daughter were in distress and a C-section has to be done. Postpartum pre-eclampsia set in after the c-section. The doctors got that under control and finally sent my wife home almost 2 weeks later. Her jaw pain got worse. The shoulder and neck pain stuck around. We got her to see multiple oral surgeons about the jaw pain with no results. On top of that, my wife developed major postpartum depression.

We finally got my wife to a pain management specialist who diagnosed her with trigeminal neuralgia. This was about 7 months after our daughter was born. By the time she was diagnosed for the jaw pain, she began developing severe lower back and hip pain. After multiple tests, they found slipped and degraded discs in her lower back as well as major arthritis in her neck. After transferring to a new PCP, she began developing more issues. She started experiencing constant fatigue, headaches, and minor joint pain. 

When my wife would go to stand up, or sometimes take a few steps after not moving, she would experience major dizziness. After a few months of what seemed to be random dizziness, numbness, tingling, and twitching started to develop in her right hand while she was experiencing the dizziness. Her PCP did multiple blood tests, x-rays and blood pressure testing. They found she was ANA positive but did not have lupus. The PCP loosely diagnosed her with fibromyalgia and possibly Sjogrens Disease. We, including the PCP, weren't happy with this diagnosis because there was still a bigger issue. We also discovered that she has Hashimoto's disease. 

In the past 2 years, symptoms have gotten worse. Her cognitive ability has decreased. She struggles to concentrate, has issues stumbling over her words, she experiences blurred vision from time to time. The dizziness/numbness issue has gotten worse. Now she gets a numb burning/needling feeling that starts in the right hand, moves up her arm, down her leg, and has started spreading to the left side of her body. This just keeps adding question marks. All the doctors she has seen have not been able to make a successful diagnosis.

I am hoping someone here may have some insight or suggestions to help her. We just moved to Texas and hoping maybe some doctor may have an idea. But we are struggling at this point. She is taking so many medications and symptoms still keep flaring up. We have a very active pre-schooler and it's really hard for all of us.",9,28,2020-02-12,c-section delivery,595,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Can postpartum depression start during pregnancy?,"I was just wondering if this is possible because I think it's happening to me. Things are not good with the baby's father and it is sending me into a really bad depression. I would seek mental health help but I'm worried that they would call CPS on me. I want to do what's best for me and the baby but I'm scared to draw attention to it. Is this pretty common during pregnancy though?

Edit: I have read all of your comments and I have a doctor's appointment Tuesday. I'm going to bring it up with my doctor and see what she can put me on to help me. As I said, things are not good with the baby's father and I have left him but it has still put me into a depression. He is not the sort of role model that I want in my son's life. His life and his family's life is nothing but chaos and drama and I don't want my son exposed to that. 

Thank you for reassuring me that everything will be fine. I was just worried that if they knew that I was having problems that they would think that I was not fit to be a parent to my son. But I guess it makes sense that if they see me trying to get help before he's even born that it will look good. I only want what's best for him. I want him to have a happy mom and a stable and loving household. I love him more than anything in this world and I would literally give my life for him.

BabyBumps,Feeling really depressed because my sisters don't seem to care at all about my pregnancy.,"I've been delaying my announcements because my stepsister had her wedding recently and I didn't want to steal her thunder or whatever.

My mom was pushing me to do them anyways because my mom flat out said she doesn't care about my stepsister's wedding and she wants to be able to talk about my baby. I ignored her because I really didn't want to be that person.

I told my actual sister before the wedding to get my mom off my nuts and because she's in from out of town and I figured her feelings would be hurt if she found out on facebook. This sister had the decency to at least act a little excited and is planning on sending all her baby stuff that she doesn't need anymore back with my parents for christmas.

Today we had an outing with my stepsisters and my mom. My mom pushed me to tell them because one of them is also out of town. The one sister had noticed I wasn't drinking at the wedding and basically said ""yea I figured"". And kind gave a half assed ""I'm happy for you.""

The other stepsister literally said NOTHING. And literally didn't speak directly to me the entire day. 

I've never been super close to these woman and I've always kind o of been a black sheep in my family. I didn't go to college, I don't have a ""Career"". But I take care of myself and my husband just fine. These people just don't see me as a responsible adult. They still see me as their stupid little sister that plays video games all day and has no motivations in life.

So I'm not super surprised and I wasn't expecting them to be jumping for joy. But the just really really seem to not give a fuck at all. I have  coworkers that barely know me that are more excited for me than these women that I grew up with and are supposed to be my family.

The whole situation is just really hurtful and now I've completely lost motivation to do my announcements because I feel like nobody is going to care.",9,13,2019-10-10,pregnancy depression,361,,,,,,,,,

I do have a job already, I do intake of health insurance claims currently but since we‚Äôre a third party processor I get paid half of what I could make if I were to work directly for the insurance company themselves, but I‚Äôve been s top employee here for 3 going on 4 years now. I have a highschool education with some college business classes so I know how to operate Microsoft word/outlook/excel/power point. Why I‚Äôve mentioned those things is due to the fact I want to know realistically if I‚Äôd have a shot in hell getting a job that paid more than $11 an hour and if on paper I‚Äôd be a candidate worth waiting the six weeks of recovery for or worth hiring before baby is here. I have great attendance, I do my work and hit goal as well as maintain accuracy. I‚Äôve done some retail in the past but would like to remain in an office setting, I just haven‚Äôt interacted with the general public for a living since I started here as everything is security clearance for HIPPA (which I‚Äôm also HIPPA certified) so I guess I would like some guidance. Where can I put my qualifications to use, and would I be worth hiring before I deliver and waiting for me to heal, or should I wait to apply and interview after baby?",8,7,2019-09-12,late pregnancy,314,,,,,,,,,

NICUParents,How to prepare for NICU stay?,"I'm so amazed by the support this community provides and I have a few questions.

This pregnancy has been all kinds of complicated (monochorionic twins who developed TTTS and had to be operated... then PPROM) and because of it, the C-section is planned for week 32. I am currently at 26 weeks and trying to prepare for the extended NICU stay. At least, we can consider ourselves lucky to know ahead of time that our babies will be in the NICU for while and prepare.


Will I get to see my babies when they are born or will they be too young for any kind of skin to skin? Will I be able to visit them while I recover from the C-section at the hospital?
After I get discharged (~4 days), how long should I spend at the NICU everyday? Will I get to take care of my babies?
What will life be like with two little ones in the hospital? I'm assuming I will also have to limit my contact with people to avoid getting sick?


I apologise for all the question but this is all overwhelming, so anything you can tell me will be incredibly helpful...",8,16,2020-01-25,NICU stay,198,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Gestational Hypertension?,"Hi all, I‚Äôm wondering if any of you who were diagnosed with gestational hypertension without preeclampsia ended up experiencing in regards to prenatal treatment and labor. 

I have a history of severe preeclampsia with my first pregnancy (born 30+5), and despite having normal bp with my second (born 35+1) I was induced for a headache and put on magnesium for labor; in hindsight, I should have pushed back against that, as my headache ended up being due to a back injury. I am currently 35+6 and watching my bp rise over the last few days, though there‚Äôs an anxiety component that‚Äôs exacerbating it. I have no protein spillage, all bloodwork is good, no headaches or other pre-e symptoms. My bp was 128/89 this am but has been as high as 147/96 (but with a pulse of 111 bpm) in the past 24 hours. I‚Äôm on baby aspirin and Wellbutrin, no other meds. 

My anxiety component comes from going into L&D on Monday to get asymmetrical foot swelling checked out. Being there definitely triggered some ptsd and the nurses made it worse by telling me they were going to put me on magnesium sulfate and induce me before even talking to my doctor about it. My bp numbers were very high (145/98 to 150/110), but my pulse was 155+ the whole time so it wasn‚Äôt just GH raising my bp - I was very open with them that I was having severe anxiety during the whole experience. My doctor intervened and shut them down, and was upset that the nurses told me what they did. She had me discharged after getting checked for a blood clot in my leg. I saw her the next day and she was satisfied with my bp in the office (128/90) though not thrilled. She is not the doctor that induced me with #2. I‚Äôve been having serious anxiety ever since and am waiting to hear back from my doctor about getting medication to calm me down. Looking at my blood pressure cuffs starts a physical panic response at this point. It‚Äôs really frustrating and embarrassing. I feel like I‚Äôm sabotaging my own pregnancy outcomes. 

I would love to hear from anyone who has had a similar experience. Especially whether or not they put you on magnesium for labor, did labetalol, or prescribed any meds for acute anxiety. Trying to mentally prepare myself for another induction, but would like to advocate for keeping this baby cooking as long as possible. And I would love to avoid mag this time around, is that a thing that they give patients with only GH and no other preeclampsia symptoms?

AskDocs,Premature baby study (azithromycin),"28M

Hello, my wife and i have recently had a premature baby at 26 week gestation, a beautiful tiny girl born at just 1 pound 1 ounce, thankfully the baby doctors have stabilised her and she appears to be doing okay on the neonatal Intensive care unit. My wife had a planned cesarean due to severe pre-eclampsia, our baby girl also had steroids a week before the surgery and had sufficient magnesium sulphite infusion before the op. 

The doctors have asked if we would like to enroll our baby on a study called AZTEC (azithromycin therepy for chronic lung disease). There is a 50% chance she will receive the antibiotic or receive a placebo (water I think).

I have already talked with the doctors at the hospital but I am always looking for additional information that I could bring up with the doctors.

BabyBumps,"Reasons from moms who considered, but didn't end up using, a doula?","First time pregnancy, currently 22wks, and yesterday I cried because I was feeling so overwhelmed about making this decision with my husband.

It's easy to find references from women who used a doula and loved the experience. My friends/family that I've talked to never considered it in the first place. After reading *Expecting Better* and *Birth Without Fear*, I started to thinking about the benefits even though I don't want an unmedicated birth. It would be a big financial commitment for us.

I'd love to hear from anyone who planned a hospital delivery under care of an OB, and considered paying for a doula... but then didn't use one. **What helped you make the decision not to hire a doula? What did you consider in the decision process?**

I'm definitely feeling some guilt about choosing *not* to hire someone now that I've seen the statistics on how they do help with birth outcomes.... I feel like I owe this little one and my future self the best statistical chances of positive outcomes and recovery. But, I can't tell if a doula *really* would make a difference or I'm just psyching myself out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A little more about my personal situation which may or may not be relevant:

* I cope with nerves by obsessively researching and preparing for all outcomes, often with spreadsheets and flow charts. I can learn all about common labor challenges and interventions ahead of time and put together a birth plan wish-list, but still when push comes to shove (HA!) I am really worried about getting overwhelmed and panicky to the point of anxiety attack. Really, the main worry I have is having a panic attack or three during labor.
* My husband wants to be supportive, but has his own issues around doctors and hospitals and he isn't a great medical advocate for himself, and doesn't fully trust himself to advocate for me if/when I start to lose my shit.
* My OB is supportive, respectful, and open to all the Evidence Based Birth questions that I brought to my last appointment. During labor, I don't think I would trust a doula more than I trust my OB if she suggested a medical intervention... but of course we can't know for certain that our OB will be the one there making the suggestions.
* I get along well with my mom and she's very comfortable dealing with medical questions and doctors. She isn't local but is a 3 hour drive away, so she is potentially an option for a second support person if we didn't hire a doula.",8,27,2020-01-15,coping during pregnancy,434,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,heart rate 160 +," 

White female, 163, 70 kilos (currently 6 months pregnant), non smoker. Dad suffers from bradychardia- and has a pacemaker (fitted when he was 55). Uncle passed away at 50 from a heart attack in his sleep.

2 years ago I suffered from anxiety and stress. I remember waking up at the time with my heart rate shooting up (then found out it was going 160 + when it happened), sweating, feeling dizzy. I went to the ER who did tests such as EKG, XRAY etc and said that the heart rate was fast but regular- and said it was anxiety related. One EKG done at the GP surgery came back as atrial flutter so I went back to hospital- the consultant again said that the GP read it wrong because the heart rate was so fast but that it was totally regular and fine. I decided to trust her- she gave me beta blockers that I never used. I decided to work on my anxiety as a result and got better.

My heart rate can still shoot up to 160 if I'm panicked- so anytime a nurse or GP takes my pulse, if I have to do public speaking, etc. It comes back down nicely as soon as I breathe and calm down. Some nurses freak out and say this is REALLY high to just be anxiety related- but then see I went to hospital etc so just leave it.

My slight worry is that I noticed that my heart rate was 176 going up stairs (they are quite steep), when it was 110 when I was walking (quite fast). Is this normal? Again, the heart rate drops back down quickly and nicely within minutes. No chest pain experienced. Am I just out of shape then?

I also noticed that my heart rate went from 90 to 120 just standing up- not sure how much I trust my fitbit but could it be PTOS? None of the GPs mentioned it to me.

I'm currently pregnant with my first baby and was assured by the midwives that it would be fine during labour- my main worry was around the epidural and whether my heart could cope with this? and cope with labour in general? I'm just worried it will be crazy high and that they will give me an emergency c section as a result?

Thanks a lot for reading and for your input- again I have been reassured by the medical staff who look after my pregnancy but was curious to get opinions from doctors on here too. As you can see in my family history my dad's side have had heart related issues so want to be on the safe side.",8,5,2020-02-10,stress during pregnancy,452,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,"32F, 29W pregnant, uncontrollable itching and mystery rash.","I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end, and I hope someone on here can help me. 

I‚Äôm 29 weeks pregnant today, and about 3 weeks ago, I started experiencing some itching on my arms that soon spread to other areas of my body. 

At first, it was just itching with no visible rash, and, since I‚Äôm pregnant, I was initially worried about having Cholestasis of Pregnancy or ICP. Within days of the itching starting, my doc sent me to the lab to get my liver screened and my bile acids checked to see if I have ICP. Everything came back normal. I also did not have the main symptom of ICP which is itching in the hands and feet, so my doc confidently ruled it out. 

Unfortunately, the rash and itching got worse from there. Almost every day I feel like I‚Äôm on the phone with nurses and doctors both at my OBGYN Office and my primary care doctor. They have suggested everything under the sun you can think of: allergy meds, topical steroids, different kinds of lotion, oatmeal baths etc. I‚Äôve tried all of them. Nothing relieves the itching. My primary care doctor even treated me for scabies, even though he admitted my rash doesn‚Äôt look like scabies... we did the treatment to be safe, and since it was harmless to treat. And, still, nothing. 

Fast forward to yesterday. The itching got so bad that I had a complete breakdown. I was itching my skin furiously, the rash was erupting everywhere, and I was so frustrated that I almost went to the ER. We live in a small town so we called ahead first to see if there was anything they could do for me before spending a small fortune for no relief. Both the doctors in labor and delivery and the ER talked on the phone with us for almost an hour and there was nothing they said they could or would do in person that I haven‚Äôt already tried. They told me to see my regular doctors in person this morning.

So, I took off of work today and luckily got an appointment with both my OB and my primary care today. My OB appointment was only slightly helpful in that he ruled out another common pregnancy rash called PUPPPs. It usually presents with extreme itching in the stomach around stretch marks. My stomach is the only place I‚Äôm not itching and I also don‚Äôt have any stretch marks. He really thinks my primary care is my best shot at a diagnosis. 

So, I‚Äôm going back to primary care in a few hours. The plan is to biopsy/scrape the rash to see if it‚Äôs something the lab can diagnose. But I probably won‚Äôt get those results for a few days, and I don‚Äôt have much hope that they can help me since it seems like every doctor in town has seen this rash and doesn‚Äôt know what to do about it. 

The rash is on my arms and legs, throat and face (mostly jawline/outer cheeks and up through my ears), on my chest, between my breasts and all over my back... mostly on the shoulder blades/upper back. It mostly looks like small, irritated red bumps, but when I itch, new bumps pop up right away that are flesh colored and larger, and if I scratch them hard enough, they seem to get a little pointed pustule on top, though I haven‚Äôt seen pus come out of any of them. They do bleed fairly quickly after itching, though. 

The only thing that seems to stop the itching is ice. If I keep an ice pack on it, it stops the itching. I itch so badly at night that I can‚Äôt sleep for more than small bits at a time. And the ice pack is the only relief that helps stop the itching long enough for me to fall back to sleep. But I can only have so much ice on me at a time before I start shivering and I can only wake up so many times throughout the night to switch ice packs. 

The only other thing I‚Äôve noticed is that the rash is made way worse by any kind of heat. So, if I get sweaty in my sleep at night, or if I even put pressure on it (my face pressed into a pillow, a blanket on top of me, etc) it immediately starts itching. 

Obviously, if it‚Äôs some kind of infection of the skin, the lab results will show that, but I‚Äôm absolutely horrified at the thought of this rash being some kind of hormonal / immune response to pregnancy, especially considering the OBGYN has no clue what it is or how to treat it. The prospect of living this way for another few months until I deliver my baby is the most hopeless feeling. That simply can‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs affecting my mental and physical health and I don‚Äôt want it to affect my baby. 

If anyone has any experience with this or any idea, no matter how small, please let me know! I‚Äôll appreciate any leads right now. I feel like I‚Äôve researched myself to death and have come up short.

AskDocs,Should I take my toddler out of daycare?,"2 year old, male, former 34 weeker 2 lb 6 oz preemie, now 22 lbs.  History includes oxygen dependent on 1/4 liter for 18 months because of severe laryngomalacia, has had 3 airway surgeries (2 supraglottoplastys and 1 triple scope), and is set to have tonsils and adenoids removed as well as tubes in his ears due to obstructive sleep apnea and chronic ear infections.  He recently (in September) started going to daycare 3 times a week.  Since that time, he has maybe been healthy enough to complete 2 whole weeks of daycare.  I understand that daycare = germs, and it's normal to get 8 colds a year.  However, this kid barely gets over something to just catch something else.  And the ear infections are ridiculous, though I understand the tubes should help.  He has not been hospitalized for illness since last year, though weve gone to the ER since hes started daycare (once for croup and once for dehydration from a stomach bug).  

His surgery is not scheduled yet as I have to wait for the scheduler to call me, but it will most likely be scheduled for January.  

I have the luxury of keeping him at home with me if need be.  We started him in daycare to help with his speech and general delays he has due to prematurity, as well as general socialization and getting used to routines, etc.  My question is, given his history and with the surgery coming up, should I take him out of daycare?

He loves daycare, and we really like it too, other than the illnesses.  And of course we would either have to pay for the entire weeks he wouldn't go to keep his spot or risk losing his spot entirely, if we took him out, so just taking him out of daycare temporarily may not be an option.

AskDocs,Autoimmune? Genetic? Munchausen's?,"My 12yo son has some weird med history and lab results - trying to see what labs and/or referrals I should ask about at upcoming appointment.

History:
Easy pregnancy & delivery. Considered SGA at birth (in the 4th percentile). APGARs 8 and 9. Placenta had ""fatty deposit"" and umbilical cord was abnormal - more straight than twisted, one part came away for a small portion then came back in (like it made the letter P). Pathology of placenta was normal, but they did not test for CMV. Doubled birth weight by 2 months, met all milestones, no concerns other than being a really rashy baby/kid.

Age 6:
- Diagnosed with combined type ADHD.
- Diagnosed with Benign Rolandic Epilepsy, started Keppra 

Age 7: 
- Diagnosed with ESES/CSWS epilepsy, treated with Keppra and high dose Valium. Brain MRI normal
- Diagnosed with Premature Andrenarchy. Doctors blame epilepsy.
- Significant behavioral issues at home, too much anxiety at school to act out.
- Still very rashy. New rash begins: hives when exposed to cold.
- Starts taking daily Zyrtec for cold urticaria and general hay fever.

Age 9:
- Declared epilepsy free. Stopped all epilepsy meds.
- Significant behavioral issues continued. 
- Eval'd for autism. ADOS-2 score came back slightly on spectrum, but was instead diagnosed with Mixed Expressive-Receptive Language Disorder and Generalized Anxiety.
- Still very rashy

Fast forward to within the last year:
- Two random incidents of joints swelling (wrist and knee) with no known injuries. Labs for JRA came back normal.
- Complains of frequent stomach aches. Requested Celiac panel. Gliadin IGA antibodies came back slightly elevated TWICE on panels a month apart. IGG levels and the other IGA level all normal on both panels.
- Still very rashy
- Still lots of behavioral issues at home. Starts intense outpatient program and psych gives several lab orders, some of which come back abnormal:
        - Vitamin D very low (not a shock, we are in the Midwest)
        - Ferratin very low
        - Iron toward lower end of normal range
        - Transferrin Saturation level low
        - Hemoglobin low, but not too far from normal range
        - RBC low, but not too far from normal range
        - Lymphocytes are slightly high (one percent over the normal percentage range given by lab)
        - Eosinophils slightly high (one percent over the normal percentage range given by lab)

We follow up with our regular ped in two weeks and the psych has suggested we have labs redrawn to see if they come back abnormal again. I feel like there's a diagnosis that we're missing (even though it might not tie ALL issues together).  What other tests or referrals should I ask for? I am thinking Vitamin B levels and all immunoglobulins. Anything else?

Height/weight: 5‚Äô9‚Äù   183 pounds
Complaint: possible ectopic pregnancy
Duration: 5 days
Medications: Zoloft, prenatal

On Tuesday, I took a pregnancy at home. Test was positive. Scheduled ob appointment on Sept 10. Wednesday, I had cramping with no spotting. Thursday, I continued to cramp and went to the ER to be checked. My hcg level was 350. My ultrasound results were put as: ‚ÄúPossible 3 mm intrauterine gestational sac near the fundal portion of the endometrium without definite fetal pole or yolk sac. Differential possibilities would include early gestation, nonviable pregnancy versus non visualized ectopic pregnancy. Recommend continued biochemical and sonographic follow up. A small amount of free pelvic fluid may be physiologic. Heterogeneous mixed echogenicity 2.2 cm nodular structure with some peripheral blood flow in the left ovary may represent a corpus luteal cyst.‚Äù
Saturday morning, I had my hcg drawn again and the level was 434, which is about a 28% raise in around 42 hours. I‚Äôm still having back pains and slight cramping along with feeling lightheaded and winded easily. I still have not had any bleeding or cramping. Just recurrent diarrhea. I‚Äôm unsure if I should be more worried about a possible ectopic and should get checked again, or if my doctors office would have already called me if my blood levels/symptoms were warning signs to them. I can‚Äôt call my ob office until Tuesday, due to the office being closed on Monday for Labor Day.",7,8,2019-09-02,early labor,243,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Silly but legitimate waxing question (I may be in the early stages of labor),"SOOOO. I'm 38 weeks today. I had planned on getting a brazillian sometime around now in my pregnancy. I asked my doctor, she seemed fine with it as long as I didn't get my stomach waxed. 
I know I've seen a lot of things talking about increased chance of infection with hair removal. Hence why I asked. 

Well. I have a wax appointment scheduled for tomorrow. Yesterday I was having super mild contractions that were so random and weren't painful at all. 
Last night I got woken up 3-4 times from pretty painful ones (this happened at least an hour and a half to two hours apart each time)

And I""ve been having more contractions (they are definitely more painful than yesterday, but all of them aren't painful) more frequently. While doing my usual morning routine they were anywhere from 5-9 minutes apart lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute and a half. THey've since become more infrequent again (now it's almost like every 15 minutes). My water has not broken. I haven't lost my mucus plug. I am not leaking. 

SO...What would you do? Trying to decide if I should cancel the wax or not...I've read that waxing is probably better than shaving (I used to wax all the time, so I know the pain aspect and all of that good stuff)

Any experiences similar to mine...? Thanks in advanced. LOL",7,21,2019-10-15,early labor,233,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Toddler foot injury,"Last night my daughter (2 F) injured her right foot while twirling to show off her new dress, the toes on her right foot caught on the carpet and her foot/ankle/knee got twisted up under her as her body continued around. She immediately screamed in pain and grabbed her foot. She‚Äôs not great at communication yet but it appears that most of her pain was (and still is) to the medial portion of her right foot proximal of the great toe. She refused to bear weight on the right foot and screamed any time she tried (despite any swelling or bruising) so we took her to urgent care for some xrays to make sure there are no obvious fractures which there are not (I‚Äôll add that the films are not great as she would not stay still).  She was splinted and sent home.

We took her to her pediatrician this morning as she still has point tenderness and will only walk on her foot in a supinated position for a few steps then gets down to crawl. Her pediatrician said that typically small fractures can‚Äôt be seen on plain films immediately following an injury so we are doing a course of rest, ice, and Motrin for a few days with a re-evaluation if she is still having pain. 

Obviously she is under the care of her pediatrician so my question is if any of the providers here have experience or insight with an injury similar in a toddler. I‚Äôm curious about what bone/ligament/structure she could have 
injured. If there is a small fracture in a metatarsal, how would it be treated?

AskDocs,Can a baby become dependent on Miralax to poop,"My son is 14months/M, born 3 months premature (so 11 months adjusted age) switched from breastmilk to formula at about 4 months old and since then he has been pretty constipated (around 10 months). Around that time our pediatrician recommended miralax, about 1 tsp daily. He is also taking 44mg Flovent 2x a day. Other than that he eats mostly formula, some cow milk (we've backed off the cow milk because of the constipation), as well as oat cereal mixed with fruits, almost always peaches and pears. And some dissolving puff/crackers. He is between 18-20lbs, very active, walks/crawls. He has never had any GI problems. He does drink some water, I'm not sure how much but probably not more than a couple ounces a day.


The miralax does fix the problem. The doc assures us that it's safe and harmless to do every day continuously. However I asked her when he will not have to take it anymore, and she said it's hard to say. She told me her own 5yo daughter has been taking it ever since 4 months of age. To me that does not sound right!!! I thought this was a temporary thing and that his body would fix it on its own. I don't want to have to give my child laxatives for years. Whenever we stop giving him miralax, his poop becomes really solid and he has a really hard time passing stools.


So I just really want to know if it is possible that my kid is or could become dependent on Miralax to poop? 

I read somewhere that a 1yo should drink about 8oz of water a day, is this correct? (I don't think he's drinking close to that amount right now.) If so, will that help the constipation?
Is there anything we can do that doesn't require medication???",6,7,2020-01-09,premature baby,306,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,"3yr old woman with ongoing hormonal related symptoms, some uncommon - PCOS or something more? Am waiting on blood test results to post","Hi there,

I am a 30-year-old woman, who has suffered from a long string of supposedly hormone-related symptoms since puberty. I have seen several endocrinologists, all who diagnosed me with PCOS, say they can't explain my more irregular symptoms but tell me not to worry about them, and send me on my way. I am wondering if there is the possibility of something more going on.  I weigh 55kg at present and am 161cm tall. I have fallen pregnant twice, but haven't gone through with the pregnancies. Apparently no hypothyroidism and no diabetes.

**My typical symptoms:**

*  irregular periods, sometimes painful (have been years without menstruating, currently getting period every two weeks)
* male pattern hirsutism (was classed as severe however I have had thousands of dollars of laser hair removal and is now somewhat reduced. Hair still returns on my upper back, face/neck, and buttocks irrespective of laser treatment)
* hormonal acne
* extreme mood swings and severe insomnia which appears to be cyclical
*  cysts on ovaries 
* issues with weight loss/management. At my highest, I have been 75kg. To lose weight, I have to reduce my calories to below 1200cal per day. 

**My less than typical symptoms:**

* severe melasma on the upper lip
* constant slight lactation from one breast for the past 6 years (have been tested for Prolactinoma and breast abnormalities both with negative results)
* hypertrophied inner labia (currently 6cm and apparently progressing)
* tubular breasts
* darkened patches of skin around the groin
* osteopenia diagnosed in my last BMD test, with subsequently elevated levels of blood calcium consistently
* moderate vitamin D deficiency

**'unrelated' medical issues:**

* Factor V Leiden deficiency
* congenital acetabular femoral impingement and have been recommended for surgery to repair a torn labrum
* Hypermobile joints and some skin hyperelasticity, not enough to diagnose as Ehlers-Danlos
* ADD for which I am medicated with dexamphetamine
* Long term issues with depression/suicidal tendencies, which I personally attribute to my health issues. 
* idiopathic urticaria
* scoliosis

**Treatment so far:**

* lifestyle changes, low carb diet, laser hair removal, etc.
* Implanon several times - discontinued
* spironolactone 100mg for hirsutism and acne for 2 years which led to elevated liver enzyme levels, edema, and dehydration issues. During this time my period stopped completely, but my doctors believed this was due to malnutrition when trying to lose weight. Discontinued
* **currently** metformin 200mg per day for the past 6 weeks - again to regulate the period and reduce hirsutism/acne. Was decided to try this instead of spironolactone. 

I have asked for a most recent blood test panel copy to post here - should be available tomorrow. The consensus seems to be: elevated prolactin is stress-related, most hormone levels are within 'normal' range, testosterone is only slightly elevated, consistently high levels of blood calcium isn't necessarily cause of concern. 

I understand PCOS causes the majority of my symptoms however the genital abnormalities, constant lactation, and melasma cause me to think that there could be something else going on. Could it be just a particularly unfortunate case of PCOS or something more? I understand there is probably not a treatment to reverse some of my symptoms, however, a definitive diagnosis beyond ""it's probably related to your PCOS"" would be of much relief to me.

Finally, I appreciate whoever has taken the time to read this post.

AskDocs,"I am pregnant and had to wean off of my adderall, how long until it's cleared from the baby's system and will be withdraw from Prozac?","31 female, white
About 200 pounds, 5'1.
Never smoker, occasional drinker but not since AI got pregnant.
Medications are: Prozac 60mg, ambien 2.5mg-5 MG as needed for sleep. Tylenol as needed, famotadine and tums as needed (but daily almost), and I've had to take vistaril 25mg for a break through anxiety attack a few weeks ago. (discontinued) Adderall regular 10mg up to 3x a day weaned off over about a month

I have a history of anxiety, adhd, severe depression, post partum depression from my last pregnancy. 

Current conditions 26 weeks pregnant (due in July) and have been on pelvic rest and light duty since late December due to bleeding and losing blood clots. OBGYN checked thoroughly and ultrasounds show health cervix, no issues, and a visual examination of my cervix and vaginal walls are intact and no tearing, so it was ruled a ""leaky blood vessel"". Amniotic fluid is great, and anatomy scan showed a very healthy, organs all in place with good blood flow, baby boy. 

Bit of back story - I found out I was pregnant in December when I was further along than I realized because I was still having a ""period"" (the spotting and bleeding I was experiencing that ultimately put me on pelvic rest a few weeks later). Okay so I have been on Prozac since before I gave birth to my second child in Nov 2016, I want to say I started it in late September because my depression was making me go a little crazy. Our home flooded in Louisiana so add that to the stress of a new baby. That baby did great, and I stayed on my low dose of Prozac for almost a year claiming things were fine but was really dealing with serious PPD. I finally stepped up and got help and since then I am now up to 60mg of Prozac daily. My insurance does not cover any name adhd medications or XR, so I have been on 10 MG Adderall up to 3x a day for about 2ish years. 

When I found out I was pregnant, I didn't want to just stop taking the Adderall so I decided it was best for me to slowly wean off. In the past if I abruptly stopped I had some really angry withdrawal symptoms, so I talked it over with my OB and Pysch and while understanding the risks, I weaned off much slower than I maybe should have. But I'm finally off of it. However after what happened during my last pregnancy I felt it was safer for me to stay on that treatment, because if I tried to do without medication again I was terrified of what I'd do to myself or my unborn baby. I had full support from both doctors. Well, the support that is tied with their cautions of course.

Okay so I stopped taking the Adderall around January/February-ish, but still on Prozac. I know both can cause the baby to withdraw once he's born. How long would the Adderall be effective in his system if I stopped taking it in January and presumably go full term to July, is there a risk he would still have any in his system to cause him to withdraw? Would the Prozac exacerbate anything or bc the Prozac is still in my system so it would be in his, would that affect how the Adderall leaves? And with the Adderall being a low dose to begin with then wean down to, does that make a difference as to whether he may withdraw at all from it? How many weeks does it take to clear their system in utero? I've seen reports that some women are going into preterm labor when they got sick so if I somehow deliver early could the Adderall still be there? 

I figure there's a chance he will withdraw from the Prozac, and I feel ashamed I still have to take it but I can't put my family through that again. My 7 year old son was terrified of me for weeks after. I just know amphetamines can be worse when it comes to withdrawing in infants so to combine the two now is really scaring me. Thank you for any help.

NICUParents,"Induction on Dec 9, 2019 (at 34 weeks GA) FTM with some questions...","Just a quick background, I have an incompetent cervix, found out at 26 weeks and have been hospital bedrest. Water broke at 30 weeks. Induced labor will be scheduled at 34 weeks to avoid future infection since I am 2cm dilated, completely open, etc. I've gotten the complete set of steroid shots and was told I won't be getting anymore. Same goes for magnesium since they only do those at 32 weeks or earlier. And my baby boy is a few oz short of being 3lbs. (he was 2lbs and 12oz last week)

For those who have experienced the same or witnessed the same case, when I do go into labor (vaginal birth at the moment because baby's head is down), will it be quicker since I am already 2cm dilated or will that not matter? I'm nervous for the labor and don't like not knowing what to expect...I'd like to at least get some idea of how things will go for me, whether it will take 15 hrs or 3 hrs to push the little one out. I know it might be different from case to case.

AskDocs,Autoimmune? Genetic? Munchausen's?,"My 12yo son has some weird med history and lab results - trying to see what labs and/or referrals I should ask about at upcoming appointment.

History:
Easy pregnancy & delivery. Considered SGA at birth (in the 4th percentile). APGARs 8 and 9. Placenta had ""fatty deposit"" and umbilical cord was abnormal - more straight than twisted, one part came away for a small portion then came back in (like it made the letter P). Pathology of placenta was normal, but they did not test for CMV. Doubled birth weight by 2 months, met all milestones, no concerns other than being a really rashy baby/kid.

Age 6:
- Diagnosed with combined type ADHD.
- Diagnosed with Benign Rolandic Epilepsy, started Keppra 

Age 7: 
- Diagnosed with ESES/CSWS epilepsy, treated with Keppra and high dose Valium. Brain MRI normal
- Diagnosed with Premature Andrenarchy. Doctors blame epilepsy.
- Significant behavioral issues at home, too much anxiety at school to act out.
- Still very rashy. New rash begins: hives when exposed to cold.
- Starts taking daily Zyrtec for cold urticaria and general hay fever.

Age 9:
- Declared epilepsy free. Stopped all epilepsy meds.
- Significant behavioral issues continued. 
- Eval'd for autism. ADOS-2 score came back slightly on spectrum, but was instead diagnosed with Mixed Expressive-Receptive Language Disorder and Generalized Anxiety.
- Still very rashy

Fast forward to within the last year:
- Two random incidents of joints swelling (wrist and knee) with no known injuries. Labs for JRA came back normal.
- Complains of frequent stomach aches. Requested Celiac panel. Gliadin IGA antibodies came back slightly elevated TWICE on panels a month apart. IGG levels and the other IGA level all normal on both panels.
- Still very rashy
- Still lots of behavioral issues at home. Starts intense outpatient program and psych gives several lab orders, some of which come back abnormal:
        - Vitamin D very low (not a shock, we are in the Midwest)
        - Ferratin very low
        - Iron toward lower end of normal range
        - Transferrin Saturation level low
        - Hemoglobin low, but not too far from normal range
        - RBC low, but not too far from normal range
        - Lymphocytes are slightly high (one percent over the normal percentage range given by lab)
        - Eosinophils slightly high (one percent over the normal percentage range given by lab)

We follow up with our regular ped in two weeks and the psych has suggested we have labs redrawn to see if they come back abnormal again. I feel like there's a diagnosis that we're missing (even though it might not tie ALL issues together).  What other tests or referrals should I ask for? I am thinking Vitamin B levels and all immunoglobulins. Anything else?

AskDocs,Is this appropriate?,"Background info:

When I was in high school, I was in a car wreck that I should not have walked away from. I had lateral compression and vertical shear pelvic fractures that were treated by open reduction and internal fixation, i.e. two screws through my pubic symphysis and one through left iliac.

I am 14 weeks and 3 days pregnant today with our first kiddo. I‚Äôve had a total of 4 miscarriages before this pregnancy. I have a retroverted uterus, along with the abdominal scar tissue you would expect from having the surgery discussed above. I don‚Äôt smoke or drink, my blood pressure is 116/71, I am 30 years old, and my BMI is normal. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and weighed 9lb 2oz at birth. My husband is 6‚Äô1‚Äù and weighed 10lb 1oz at birth. Large babies run in both of our families, and everyone is tall. I am O negative, hubs is A positive.

I‚Äôm including all of that because I honestly want to know if my knee jerk reaction/gut feeling is accurate and reasonable based specifically on my situation.

I had my first OB visit at 9 weeks and the doctor was a tiny bit dopey, but whatever. I don‚Äôt have a choice who my doctor is because my health insurance is through the military, and I‚Äôm being treated at the Naval hospital on base. I told her I just wanted to do the best thing for the baby given my past medical history. Whatever the best thing is, I would do. I‚Äôve had more than one doctor tell me vaginal birth isn‚Äôt in the cards because of the pelvic fixation. The OB and I discussed that surgery, and I asked what the delivery plan would be, specifically if I would be scheduled for a C-section, or they would wait until I went into labor and then perform one, etc. She told me ‚Äúwe know that the best thing for the baby is a natural, non-medicated, vaginal birth,‚Äù and I asked her how that would be possible to accomplish in my case since my pelvis is fixed. She told me that they could ‚Äútry like a trial of labor first‚Äù before doing the C-section, because ‚Äúsometimes the baby might not be too big to fit.‚Äù My initial reaction was thinking that that seems like a completely unnecessary risk! I didn‚Äôt argue with her because it didn‚Äôt seem worth it at the time.

She has since done other somewhat infuriating things, such as forgetting more than once to order the lab work we‚Äôve discussed at the same time, which means that I have to go back to the lab days later for the forgotten panel or two after the initial draw. Ignoring the potential inaccuracies this may create in the various results, it‚Äôs kind of a pretty big inconvenience to have to keep going back because something was left off. The only reason the forgotten panels eventually get ordered is because I‚Äôll look at the lab order while I‚Äôm in the lab and realize she forgot to include a test, like a liver and kidney function panel she wanted to have done, and sometimes the tech catches it because the lab order doesn‚Äôt make sense. Then they or I have to try to get ahold of her and wait for her to put the order in, usually days later. I asked to have nuchal thickness screening done with the bloodwork, and her nurse told me that they don‚Äôt routinely order those, despite the particular screening lab work not being as accurate without it. another time, it took two weeks to get ahold of her to remind her that the test she promised she would order the day of my appointment still hadn‚Äôt been put in. There have been quite a few similar incidents since she has been providing my care.

So again, my question is basically is it reasonable to be wondering about her competency? Is her ‚Äúbirth plan‚Äù appropriate? Advice?

TL;DR: I had internal pelvic fixations after a car wreck. Am now pregnant with first kid after history of complications, doc wants me to try to deliver non-medicated, vaginally first before performing a C-section. Same doc has made a series of mistakes so far that worry me that even if I agreed to a trial of labor, complications or a crisis that came up during said labor wouldn‚Äôt be quickly/appropriately recognized or addressed.

BabyBumps,Worried about preterm labor,"This pregnancy has been hellishly complicated. Check my post history for more details but long story short: HG so severe it requires a Zofran pump and weekly IV fluids, gestational diabetes with fasting numbers that we keep chasing with higher doses of insulin but can‚Äôt get under control, slow growth turned big belly and polyhydramnios, chronic hypertension. Yeah, all the fun shit. 

I‚Äôve had an irritable uterus since about 25 weeks. I‚Äôve had multiple trips to L&D due to consistent, timetable contractions with no cervical change. I‚Äôve had several instances of bright red spotting. The BH became baseline, I learned to ignore them because I had serial cervical checks that weren‚Äôt showing any change even when having contractions every 2-3 minutes. 

On Sunday, I picked up my toddler when he woke up from his nap. He weighs about 34lb. Immediately after doing it I got a sharp, shooting pain in my lower abdomen. I then began having consistent BH and intermittent sharp cramps in the abdomen. I figured I had just pulled a muscle or my round ligaments and just took it very easy the rest of the day. 

Monday, the BH had never stopped. The cramps were still intermittent but got sharper. I also began having a burning pain in the side of my bump that felt like something tearing. I tried all the tricks - chugged water, took a warm bath, laid down. By 5:30pm when my husband got off work, it was still happening and I was having some more bright red spotting. Baby was still moving but I called L&D and they told me to come in to be safe.

The monitors picked up pretty consistent contractions. Usually my BH are tiny little hills, but some of these were big old spikes. Baby looked great. They checked my cervix and it was mid position, soft, 25% effaced but closed. They monitored me for 2 hours and my cervix didn‚Äôt change so they basically told me as long as I‚Äôm not dilating, there‚Äôs not anything they can do. The doctor did tell me that my uterus is measuring 6 weeks ahead and that this puts me at risk for preterm labor because it can make my body think I‚Äôm further along than I am. 

So if I‚Äôm not dilating, why am I worried? Because last week when I had spotting I got a cervical check. And it was described as hard, long, and closed. So within a week it has softened up and began to efface. I‚Äôm only 30 weeks. I‚Äôve had a gut feeling from the start that this pregnancy was going to end early. Delivery is currently planned for 37 weeks and I‚Äôm afraid we won‚Äôt make it there. I have polyhydramnios and am terrified my water will break at home, the cord will prolapse and my baby will die or be brain damaged. That‚Äôs not paranoia - it‚Äôs a very real risk with poly. When I had it with my son, I was told if my water broke at home I was to immediately get on all fours and call 911. I‚Äôve dealt with the shitshow that is this pregnancy very well - I‚Äôve only cried twice, even when I was in excruciating pain from pulled muscles from vomiting 70 times in one day. But I‚Äôm scared all the time. I feel like I haven‚Äôt gotten to enjoy it at all.",6,3,2020-01-15,preterm labor,567,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,"I am pregnant and had to wean off of my adderall, how long until it's cleared from the baby's system and will be withdraw from Prozac?","31 female, white
About 200 pounds, 5'1.
Never smoker, occasional drinker but not since AI got pregnant.
Medications are: Prozac 60mg, ambien 2.5mg-5 MG as needed for sleep. Tylenol as needed, famotadine and tums as needed (but daily almost), and I've had to take vistaril 25mg for a break through anxiety attack a few weeks ago. (discontinued) Adderall regular 10mg up to 3x a day weaned off over about a month

I have a history of anxiety, adhd, severe depression, post partum depression from my last pregnancy. 

Current conditions 26 weeks pregnant (due in July) and have been on pelvic rest and light duty since late December due to bleeding and losing blood clots. OBGYN checked thoroughly and ultrasounds show health cervix, no issues, and a visual examination of my cervix and vaginal walls are intact and no tearing, so it was ruled a ""leaky blood vessel"". Amniotic fluid is great, and anatomy scan showed a very healthy, organs all in place with good blood flow, baby boy. 

Bit of back story - I found out I was pregnant in December when I was further along than I realized because I was still having a ""period"" (the spotting and bleeding I was experiencing that ultimately put me on pelvic rest a few weeks later). Okay so I have been on Prozac since before I gave birth to my second child in Nov 2016, I want to say I started it in late September because my depression was making me go a little crazy. Our home flooded in Louisiana so add that to the stress of a new baby. That baby did great, and I stayed on my low dose of Prozac for almost a year claiming things were fine but was really dealing with serious PPD. I finally stepped up and got help and since then I am now up to 60mg of Prozac daily. My insurance does not cover any name adhd medications or XR, so I have been on 10 MG Adderall up to 3x a day for about 2ish years. 

When I found out I was pregnant, I didn't want to just stop taking the Adderall so I decided it was best for me to slowly wean off. In the past if I abruptly stopped I had some really angry withdrawal symptoms, so I talked it over with my OB and Pysch and while understanding the risks, I weaned off much slower than I maybe should have. But I'm finally off of it. However after what happened during my last pregnancy I felt it was safer for me to stay on that treatment, because if I tried to do without medication again I was terrified of what I'd do to myself or my unborn baby. I had full support from both doctors. Well, the support that is tied with their cautions of course.

Okay so I stopped taking the Adderall around January/February-ish, but still on Prozac. I know both can cause the baby to withdraw once he's born. How long would the Adderall be effective in his system if I stopped taking it in January and presumably go full term to July, is there a risk he would still have any in his system to cause him to withdraw? Would the Prozac exacerbate anything or bc the Prozac is still in my system so it would be in his, would that affect how the Adderall leaves? And with the Adderall being a low dose to begin with then wean down to, does that make a difference as to whether he may withdraw at all from it? How many weeks does it take to clear their system in utero? I've seen reports that some women are going into preterm labor when they got sick so if I somehow deliver early could the Adderall still be there? 

I figure there's a chance he will withdraw from the Prozac, and I feel ashamed I still have to take it but I can't put my family through that again. My 7 year old son was terrified of me for weeks after. I just know amphetamines can be worse when it comes to withdrawing in infants so to combine the two now is really scaring me. Thank you for any help.

BabyBumps,Asking advice regarding short road trip late in pregnancy,"Hello! My partner wants us to go to an nhl game to see our team play on December 28th. We're Pittsburgh fans but live in KY so we'd be going to Nashville which is about 2ish hours away. We really really wanted to make a game up north this year and just never made it happen, and this is likely our last chance for something like this for quite a while. 

Thing is, I'm due January 10th. At the time of the game I could literally go into labor at any point. As a FTM I have no idea whether it may be unreasonably painful or uncomfortable to make a two hour drive, sit through a game and then drive back same day at 38w pregnant. 

I really want to go but am feeling somewhat apprehensive. Am I crazy for thinking it's fine? Would love to hear any advice or stories from those of you who have maybe done similar things so late in pregnancy.",5,9,2019-12-08,late pregnancy,165,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,"Pregnancy depression (possible trigger warning, abortion and mental health)","I'm not very good at introductions so I'll just jump right into my story. I need some solid advice. I am now almost at 7 weeks and I'm at the verge of a breakdown it feels like. I'm turning 18 in a month, have been living in youth facilities since I was 14 and have been struggling with my mental health for a long time. My boyfriend and I have been dating since August and in the beginning of September I moved into his apartment. A little while ago we found out I was pregnant, which initially was good news for me (start of something new, good reason to put my focus on getting my sh*t together) but my bf is very vocal in not wanting this pregnancy. I told him I needed time to make my decision and I feel like I'm under so much pressure to get the baby aborted, just today I was telling him about my doubts and he just HAD TO bring up how bad of an idea it would be to gave a baby right now. This is definitely not what I need as of now and I've been very clear to him about needing someone to support me in this process as I have literally no one except for him. I'm really leaning more towards keeping the baby but my question is if I can actually be a good mother to my child if I've been struggling with my emotions (thoughts of suicide) and happiness for so long? I really do intend on being a good mom and I'd hate myself forever if I were to destroy something so precious but I am so unsure and scared right now and.

AskDocs,heart rate 170,"White female, 163, 70 kilos (currently 6 months pregnant), non smoker. Dad suffers from bradychardia- and has a pacemaker (fitted when he was 55). Uncle passed away at 50 from a heart attack in his sleep.

&#x200B;

2 years ago I suffered from anxiety and stress. I remember waking up at the time with my heart rate shooting up (then found out it was going 160 + when it happened), sweating, feeling dizzy. I went to the ER who did tests such as EKG, XRAY etc and said that the heart rate was fast but regular- and said it was anxiety related. One EKG done at the GP surgery came back as atrial flutter so I went back to hospital- the consultant again said that the GP read it wrong because the heart rate was so fast but that it was totally regular and fine. I decided to trust her- she gave me beta blockers that I never used. I decided to work on my anxiety as a result and got better.

&#x200B;

My heart rate can still shoot up to 160 if I'm panicked- so anytime a nurse or GP takes my pulse, if I have to do public speaking, etc. It comes back down nicely as soon as I breathe and calm down. Some nurses freak out and say this is REALLY high to just be anxiety related- but then see I went to hospital etc so just leave it.

&#x200B;

My slight worry is that I noticed that my heart rate was 176 going up stairs (they are quite steep), when it was 110 when I was walking (quite fast). Is this normal? Again, the heart rate drops back down quickly and nicely within minutes. No chest pain experienced. Am I just out of shape then?

I also noticed that my heart rate went from 90 to 120 just standing up- not sure how much I trust my fitbit but could it be PTOS? None of the GPs mentioned it to me.

&#x200B;

I'm currently pregnant with my first baby and was assured by the midwives that it would be fine during labour- my main worry was around the epidural and whether my heart could cope with this? and cope with labour in general? I'm just worried it will be crazy high and that they will give me an emergency c section as a result?

&#x200B;

Thanks a lot for reading and for your input- again I have been reassured by the medical staff who look after my pregnancy but was curious to get opinions from doctors on here too.

NICUParents,"Induction on Dec 9, 2019 (at 34 weeks GA) FTM with some questions...","Just a quick background, I have an incompetent cervix, found out at 26 weeks and have been hospital bedrest. Water broke at 30 weeks. Induced labor will be scheduled at 34 weeks to avoid future infection since I am 2cm dilated, completely open, etc. I've gotten the complete set of steroid shots and was told I won't be getting anymore. Same goes for magnesium since they only do those at 32 weeks or earlier. And my baby boy is a few oz short of being 3lbs. (he was 2lbs and 12oz last week)

For those who have experienced the same or witnessed the same case, when I do go into labor (vaginal birth at the moment because baby's head is down), will it be quicker since I am already 2cm dilated or will that not matter? I'm nervous for the labor and don't like not knowing what to expect...I'd like to at least get some idea of how things will go for me, whether it will take 15 hrs or 3 hrs to push the little one out. I know it might be different from case to case.

Also, how well do babies at that gestational age and weight do in terms of NICU stay? They say 34 weeks babies do very well but my LO is on the smaller side...

I was just notified of the possible negative interaction by my pharmacist when I picked up the prescription.  However, I can't reach the doctor and won't get an answer until Monday at the earliest.

 I have read that I can take the Clarithromycin as long as I pause the Pravastatin but I am not sure how long the statin stays in my system. Should I wait a few days?

AskDocs,Doctor wants to stop my ADHD meds because I am not in school?,"I am Female, 23 years old, 200 pounds, and height 4'11"" (overweight I know, had a child and gained weight on top of pregnancy weight before losing, have lost 50lbs in 6 months and continuing that journey still).

I am diagnosed by evaluation hypomanic bipolar, severe depression, anxiety and insomnia (not related) and, not PTSD/ not an ""official term"" diagnosis, but I have ""trauma based coping inability"", apparently just long-term mental shit from traumatic situations that mess with me (I have never heard it beforehand)
In July, I was put on 10mg adderall XR after trying a non stimulant that caused severe side effects. 2 months later he put me on 15mg Adderall XR. A month later, 30mg Adderall XR and talked about continuing raising my dosage and taking an afternoon IR when we hit my correct IR dose. I was in college and had 2 separate medical issues and per instructor and medical advice, dropped out because of issues. 
Immediately after, doctor began expressing the idea of taking me off of ADHD medication altogether because, word for word, ""I don't think patients should be taking stimulants if they aren't in school because that is the only excuse to need to regularly focus""

I have had my ADHD symptoms since as far back as I can remember but grew up with medical neglect, wasn't diagnosed (it was a total surprise) until December 2018). Doctor would not medicate me initially, then put me on a non stimulant and I had severe side effects, and then prescribed me Adderall XR. There is no high to my medication after my first week of being on it when I started at 10mg (in July) for the first time ever. While each dosage increase has shown medically/mentally recognized progress by my doctor, and I have no heart problems or current/past drug addictions and my blood pressure is freaking amazing, he refuses to continue adjusting my dosage any higher to my ideal dosage like we previously talked about BECAUSE I am not currently in school (had to drop out for medical reasons he diagnosed that inhibited my ability to attend, he also acknowledges and supports/suggested my dropping out but refuses to write administration a letter that would excuse my debt, saying he refuses because ""education is not his profession"" , can't get back into school without the letter unless I pay $1500)

AskDocs,Doctor wants to stop my ADHD meds because I am not in school?,"I am Female, 23 years old, 200 pounds, and height 4'11"" (overweight I know, had a child and gained weight on top of pregnancy weight before losing, have lost 50lbs in 6 months and continuing that journey still).

I am diagnosed by evaluation hypomanic bipolar, severe depression, anxiety and insomnia (not related) and, not PTSD/ not an ""official term"" diagnosis, but I have ""trauma based coping inability"", apparently just long-term mental shit from traumatic situations that mess with me (I have never heard it beforehand)
In July, I was put on 10mg adderall XR after trying a non stimulant that caused severe side effects. 2 months later he put me on 15mg Adderall XR. A month later, 30mg Adderall XR and talked about continuing raising my dosage and taking an afternoon IR when we hit my correct IR dose. I was in college and had 2 separate medical issues and per instructor and medical advice, dropped out because of issues. 
Immediately after, doctor began expressing the idea of taking me off of ADHD medication altogether because, word for word, ""I don't think patients should be taking stimulants if they aren't in school because that is the only excuse to need to regularly focus""

I have had my ADHD symptoms since as far back as I can remember but grew up with medical neglect, wasn't diagnosed (it was a total surprise) until December 2018). Doctor would not medicate me initially, then put me on a non stimulant and I had severe side effects, and then prescribed me Adderall XR. There is no high to my medication after my first week of being on it when I started at 10mg (in July) for the first time ever. While each dosage increase has shown medically/mentally recognized progress by my doctor, and I have no heart problems or current/past drug addictions and my blood pressure is freaking amazing, he refuses to continue adjusting my dosage any higher to my ideal dosage like we previously talked about BECAUSE I am not currently in school (had to drop out for medical reasons he diagnosed that inhibited my ability to attend, he also acknowledges and supports/suggested my dropping out but refuses to write administration a letter that would excuse my debt, saying he refuses because ""education is not his profession"" , can't get back into school without the letter unless I pay $1500)

I'm on 30mg Adderall XR once a day immediately in the morning, a dose he says he prescribes to children so ""it's no wonder it isn't working anymore"" and ""I just personally don't think you need it enough anymore since you aren't in school"".

AskDocs,Symptoms go away and then resurface? Don't know what's wrong?,"Me: 27F, 5'0, 185lbs, no history of significant medical issues. No recent falls or head trauma

Since Christmas, I've had a host of weird symptoms. Nausea, some confusion, becoming overheated easily, excessive fatigue, and some constipation issues. When the nausea surfaces, I have this weird back of head pain that permeates down into my neck and upper back. It's not a headache but more feels like I've pulled a muscle. It's dull and more annoying than being actually painful. It usually happens in the mornings. No, I'm not pregnant (doctor tested me twice and I tested myself once üòÖ)

On Christmas, the symptoms were really bad to where I didn't eat at all and did a lot of dry heaving into the toilet. I slept a lot too that day. I got a little better the next couple of days to where I could eat but then that following Sunday night after Christmas, I was vomiting and had diarrhea. Same weird head pain too. I only vomited twice but had the chills and a fever of 100.8 at my highest. The duration of symptoms lasted 48 hours. My husband, two days later, then exhibited similar symptoms (chills, fever, vomiting and diarrhea) and we both chalked it up to bring the stomach flu. My husband recovered completely within 36 hours. I got better too, but my nausea, weird head pain, becoming overheated and some constipation persisted to some degree so I saw my PCP at the end of that week (Jan 9 actually). Blood work showed markers for possibly an acute viral infection and my doctor advised me that if symptoms persisted, I head to the ER. That weekend, I felt better than I had since before Christmas so I didn't go to the ER. However, that following Tuesday (Jan 14), my symptoms of nausea and head pain (decreased but still present) returned and then subsided by the end of the day so I didn't call my doctor or go to the ER. I felt good the rest of the week until the following Tuesday (Jan 21), where I felt the same symptoms again, albeit the head pain even less so this time. I did call my doctor this time and she advised that I go to an urgent care. At the urgent care facility, I got checked for the third time for pregnancy (since I didn't have my period, which should have happened the week prior; negative again). My urine test though showed signs of a UTI, which I'm currently being treated for with antibiotics.

I haven't had symptoms since 1/21. Could a UTI have really caused my month-long weird symptoms? Anything else it might be? I didn't have my usual symptoms of UTI which, before when I had them and it's been awhile, I would only get the urgency to pee a lot. I'm really hoping that the UTI was the culprit all along and that my symptoms don't resurface. Also, I'm thinking that having the stomach flu in the midst of this weird illness was just a coincidence (my mom said she had it before me, so I probably just caught it from her)

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated :)",3,1,2020-01-25,pregnancy trauma,533,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,"Cystic Acne, Bruxism/TMJ, Anxiety- Treatment Suggestions","27F   \*edited to add more detail

5'4, 120 pounds

social drinker (1-2 beers or glasses of wine, twice a week or so)

diet: thanks to my mediterranean husband who loves to cook, I eat a lot of food considered to be in the med diet- lots of olive oil, tomatoes, salads, lentils, olives, veggies, fish, chicken and turkey. When I do eat red meat (1-2 times a week?) it could be pork or beef, but usually a good quality one from a fresh market. However, let's be honest, I am still eating sweets or fried food from time to time. I drink espresso every day in the morning with 2% milk, I sometimes have a small glass of milk in the evening. I eat regular bread, cheese, etc. I haven't tried cutting any particular food groups out of my diet (no doctor has asked me about my diet.)

living in Spain (with both public and private insurance)

I am looking for advice on how I could take a more holistic approach on my health issues, and whether they are likely connected. Currently, I have visited dermatologists (3 different ones to get multiple opinions) and other general doctors for these issues, but when I seek advice on **how to treat the ROOT of the problem**, and whether anxiety is likely the root, it seems that my doctors have been reluctant to discuss anything outside of their specialty. **Can anyone suggest the type of specialist that I could visit that would take a look at my health issues more holistically?** I am hoping to find an area in medicine that would look at my diet, lifestyle, stress and anxiety management, etc. in relation to the health issues I am experiencing. I have public and private healthcare here, so I should be able to locate something, my problem is that I really don't know where to search.

Additionally, does anyone have a suggestion for an alternative to Accutane that has fewer side effects? Before this flare up happened, my husband and I were planning on starting to try to get pregnant soon. Obviously, we wouldn't be able to do that anytime soon if I follow this treatment. How is cystic acne affected by pregnancy hormones? :)

A brief explanation of my medical issues:

**Acne**: I have had acne since I was a teenager, but it became cystic in my early 20s. It shows up on my chin/jawline and cheeks only. Between the ages of 24 and 27, I have had three separate severe flare ups and was prescribed antibiotics each time by my dermatologist. During each of the 3 flare ups, I was taking antibiotics for about 3 months (yikes!) This third flare up, which I am currently still going through, has not responded much to oral antibiotics OR the same antibiotic applied in a topical tonic solution. Additionally, the third flare up seems different than the first two- I have acne in my T-zone as well and on my nose, a few on my forehead, etc. Basically all over and lots of small, hard ones in addition to several deeper cysts. Now, my dermatologist wants me to start taking Accutane, but I am worried about starting such an intense treatment.

**Bruxism/TMJ**: This is something that I have struggled with on and off since my early 20s. I grind my teeth at night during certain stressful periods. Recently, during this acne flare up, I realized that the soreness and stiffness in my jaw was not going away for several days, so I went to an otolaryngologist who advised me to take Valium 5 mg for 5 nights to relax my jaw. This helped out a lot, and for the past two months I have taken the Valium a couple of times before bed when I have tension in my jaw.

**Anxiety**: its something that runs in my family, I have never gone to a therapist about it and mostly just deal with it on my own (going to yoga, exercising, deep breathing, stretching, resting, hot bath, etc.) I sometimes feel my skin on my cheeks or neck getting hot when I notice I am getting anxious. I also feel that I am keeping tension in my body, in my jaw and hands gripping too hard on something, etc. I am an elementary teacher, so high stress job, and am living in a different country where I am still struggling to learn the language- a lot of my anxiety comes from situations where I need to speak in Spanish or times when I feel like an outsider here. Socially, if I am out with friends/coworkers who speak English, I feel much more comfortable and become much more outgoing.",3,6,2019-11-12,stress during pregnancy,784,,,,,,,,,

Age: 22 years old

Sex: Female

Height: 5'3/160cm

Weight: 220lbs/99.7kg

Race: Black, hispanic

Primary Complaint: I found a hard painless lump on the left of my urethral opening. It displaces the location of my urethral opening to the far right.

Duration: Uncertain, possibly between 1 and 7 days days. Discovered last night early this morning 12/1/19

Existing medical issues: obesity, irregular periods (one period about every 3-5 months)

Medications: None currently. Last took hydrocodone for one week gallbladder removal in  April 2019.

Drink: On special occasion (holidays) and never in between. Apx 2 - 4 12oz beers per year. Last drank on thanks giving. One 12oz 5% alcohol craft beer.

Smoke: Never. Irregular smoke last smoked 4 years ago.

Drugs: Never. Last smoked weed and took unprescribed xanax 5 years ago. 

Description:
I noticed there was a lump on the side of my urethral opening early this morning. It doesn't hurt at all and I have no idea how long it has been there. It most likely wasnt there longer than one week but it is possible since its painless. 

Other than that my last sexual contact was over 3 years ago and I was tested for STDs after more than once. I have had a normal vaginal birth, full term with an epidural and natural tear. In the past 2 years I have gained 60lbs.

I was breast feeding exclusively for 2 years up until august 2019. My period was nonexistent for 2 years because of the breast feeding. Came back monthly for 2 cycles and then disappeared until October and continued again with a regular cycle (30 days).

The lump by my urethral opening extends from under my labia minora to the urethral opening its maybe about the side of a dime and is round like a ball. I press it and it does not hurt and it is very smooth. I cannot feel it from inside my vagina. It is so large it has displaced my urethral opening from the center to the far right almost tucked under my right labia minora.

My cervix is very low but I have a short vaginal cavity and it hasnt been abnormal for me to feel it this low before. I don't feel anything I hadn't felt before on the inside. 

Is this something I should be concerned about or is it one of those things that just happens sometimes and resolves on it's own. Right now I'm worried just because any lumps kind of worry me but at the same time it doesn't hurt so I'm not really sure if I should be co concerned. Should I be?

BabyBumps,How long was your induced labor? Also a few other induction questions!,"I'm getting super nervous about everything. My appointment to figure out ""go time"" is on Thursday, and we're supposed to decide a date and game plan and all of that for a 37 week induction, with a C-section as a backup plan depending on how things go. This is supposed to be what's safest for me and baby both with my conditions, but I'm finding a lot of conflicting information. Some people say inductions are twice as painful but twice as fast, some say they were in labor into two days despite all the pitocin in the world. So I'm just curious how other people's went so I can maybe get an idea. I'm the kind of person that calms down when I'm informed on a topic I'm fretting about.

Additionally, how much room do you realistically have when it comes to choosing a date, at least on the hospital side of things? (I know it's ultimately up to the baby, haha.) 11/11 is just a cute date and lines up with the current planned week. Plus that Monday would also make the most sense for my husband to take his time off work, so I'm hoping I'll have some freedom to choose. But of course I'm clueless since I'm a FTM. I really have no idea how any of this works so any experiences you guys would be willing to share would be amazing.

And of course, it's probably asked a million times, but what about induction without an epidural? Depending on my lab results, I may have to go without and I'm freaking out about the pain. 

Bonus points for experiences from anyone with similar risk factors as me as the cause for induction - obese, high blood pressure, low platelets, and risk of pre-eclampsia.",3,18,2019-10-22,induced labor,297,,,,,,,,,

Medical history: 21-hydroxylase deficiency, PMDD, flu turned bronchitis. Medications and drugs in the past 30 days: generic Seasonique while skipping placebo week and jumping into the next pack, Albuterol inhaler, THC edibles, Nyquil, Mucinex

I take birth control continuously to prevent periods. I have PMDD, and the hormonal changes during my period and right before it frequently put me in the psych ward. With generic Seasonique and skipping ""placebo week"" as directed by an OBGYN, I have successfully avoided both menstruating and pregnancy since February 2019.

This week, it was time for a new 90-day pack. I was given the same meds, same doses, but a new generic label. I have never missed a pill and I typically take them about 24 hours apart. Last night, I got light bleeding along with lower back aches, abdominal cramps, and after already being extra stressed since Sunday. This is when I'd be getting my period if I was taking placebo week, but it shouldn't have happened.

So what DID happen? If the meds are truly the same, why am I responding to them differently than before? Most importantly, is there a chance that this new label may not work at all on me despite it having the same meds and doses in them? Since I'm sexually active, does this mean continuing this med as a contraceptive puts me at risk of a pregnancy, even though the only difference is it's called Daysee instead of Seasonique?

EDIT: the same thing happened to my sister with generic BC and unfortunately, she was hospitalized after her doctors realized it was in fact the ""new"" BC. So I'm worried.",3,3,2020-01-02,stress during pregnancy,286,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Feeling discouraged about breastfeeding and the slide back into depression,"I have never posted here before and am fairly new to reddit and this thread. On Mobile. I gave birth last week on Wednesday and had a beautiful little girl.  I was in labor for 3 days before needing an emergency c section. I wanted to breastfeed her one because I wanted to but also because I promised my husband that I would breastfeed.  I wasn't and am always sick so we wanted to try to help her with that. Unfortunately she doesn't latch. After a week of bottle feeding and generally pissing her off by try in to get her to latch we went to see a lactation specialist who gave me a shield to try. She latches to it but with much difficulty and will only try for a short period of time, so has to be finished by a bottle.  My problem other than dealing with the guilt of failing my promise is the clots. I have very large breasts. Before pregnancy was a G cup. I have 2-3 clots in each breast with the smallest being the size of a gumball and the largest the size of a orange. The orange sized one is now infected and while I am doing everything I can think of to help I cant get it to go away.  I use hot/cold compress, showers,  immersing whole breast, massage both by hand and percussion massager.  I still cant help it. Failing all of this is making me feel depressed.  I have depression, anxiety, PTSD,  and insomnia and that was all before I was pregnant!  During the pregnancy I was much more upbeat and my husband adored our talks but now I can see his panic that I am slipping back into the funk with a baby to take care of this time. I had convinced myself that I was doing fine until the doctor told me I was showing markers for ppd. I just feel so discouraged and confused.  Please help.

The prolapses are clearly visible from the entrance and when I move my labia apart in the upper left side of the cystocele is what I can only describe as a tunnel/hole that I do not have on the other side of it. It is uncomfortable to touch so Im assuming it's abnormal.

Is it abnormal? What is it likely to be? What treatment options are available to me for the whole disaster that is my vagina?",3,7,2019-11-24,full term birth,179,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,Second opinion: Cervical bumps,"Backstory: It started when I went to take my tampon out but realized its not inside. The forgetful person that I am, I knew I must have taken it out earlier. And rightly so. But while I was probing, my fingers caught on to something unusual. It was a line of bumps on my cervix. It felt exactly how a tampon string feels. So my first instinct was that I had retained a piece of tampon string inside. Upon closer inspection though, I felt 4 distinct bumps. That was clearly not a string. I panicked and went to the doctor for a pelvic exam. My pap smear came back normal. My doctor said they were just harmless follicles probably formed during child birth/delivery. I told the doctor I never had a normal delivery. I had a C-section some 11 years ago and 2 D&C‚Äôs for miscarriage. My doctor was still unconcerned. But I am worried. These bumps feel more like lymph nodes and are located right where the vagina meets the cervix. I can slightly move them around when I probe. And they may have grown since last assessment because I feel fuller during intercourse. And not in a good way. Should I push my doctor for further evaluation?

My cat (100% indoor cat, never been outside, but overdue for rabies vaccine, all other animals in home UTD) clawed the shit out of my arm, profuse bleeding. The dorsal side of my hand got it the worst, and there is a puncture wound on the fleshy part between index finger and thumb. This part swelled up very quickly (less than 2 minutes) to the size of a ping pong ball chopped in half. Immediately put it on ice and rushed to ER.

 I have a normal diet, drink lots of water, etc. I'm on birth control and started cod oil pills a month ago (after the pain already existed).

Was given 2 different antibiotics for a UTI and medication for yeast infection by a doctor but neither worked (both relieved the pain slightly when in use but pain came back as intense shortly after). Also was given multiple pregnancy tests all negative.

AskDocs,Weird migraine that only hurts when I move my head?,"Hey everyone. My first post in this forum. I am [23F], 5‚Äô3 and currently 197lbs, not the healthiest, and have been on psychiatric medications for a long time. I am also currently 30 weeks pregnant. Not looking for treatment, just looking for answers on what the hell this migraine could be. 

Health conditions: type 1 diabetic since 9mo old, 30 weeks pregnant with a healthy but larger percentile baby (80th); two compression fractures in my lowest vertebrae/chronic back pain, gastroparesis and a minor traumatic brain injury from a horseback riding accident when I was 16. Complex PTSD and anxiety/depression, BPD traits. My doctor believes I got PANDAS from strept throat when I was 12 as well. 

Meds: Wellbutrin xl 450mg, lithium carbonate 150mg 2x a day, humalog insulin (dose varies by insulin pump daily), reglan, Zofran, tums, prenatal vitamin, fish oil vitamin. 
I also drink between 8-11 17oz water bottles a day, so certainly not dehydrated. 

So. I‚Äôve only had this migraine once before, about a year ago. I got very stressed out and suddenly it felt like I got sucker punched in the entire left side of my head right behind my temple. The pain lasted 1 1/2 - 2 weeks last time, and was debilitating, and no one could figure it out, and just threw me on Tylenol with codeine which didn‚Äôt even help. Headache doesn‚Äôt hurt if I keep my head down, basically chin to neck looking at the floor. But if I lift my head to look eye level or above, it‚Äôs like excruciating shocks of pain go through the top and around the back of my head, but not completely to the right side. Sometimes down my left sinus too, which is sometimes accompanied by the scent of blood in my left nostril. 

It‚Äôs really weird and painful and sucks, and randomly happened again yesterday and now I am suffering and praying that it doesn‚Äôt last as long as the last time last year. I find myself irritable too, but who‚Äôs to say if it‚Äôs only from the pain, or being 30 weeks pregnant with chronic back pain too. My pregnancy has been very stressful because of social reasons/drama, but the past few days have actually been really nice and relaxing so I‚Äôm not sure if stress triggered it this time. 
I called my OB and they weren‚Äôt sure what it was but told me all they can tell me to do is take Tylenol, and if I need stronger meds to go to the ER or L&D. 
When I was in the ER last year because of it, they did an MRI or CT scan because I told them that occasionally I would smell blood in my left nostril when I would lift my head with this migraine. They told me they couldn‚Äôt see anything like DVT/stroke or anything, which I guess was what they were worried about. 

I should also add that when I was 16 and had the horseback riding fall/accident, I was thrown from the horse across the full sized ring and landed/impact on my left side and then rolled until I hit the fence at the other end. Brutal basically. So I landed on my left hip, shoulder, and side of my head (in a very expensive safety helmet that cracked in half from the impact). I‚Äôve noticed throughout my pregnancy that sleeping on my left side has been painful because of my hip and shoulder, but never my head.

What the hell is this migraine? 
It really sucks and nothing seems to make it better. Pain medications are limited for me because of pregnancy and being on lithium. I just really hate having this on top of being 30w pregnant and how uncomfortable I am from pregnancy alone right now. I‚Äôm hoping it will go away quicker than last times.",2,3,2020-01-25,PTSD pregnancy,641,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Short luteal phase - am I at risk for health complications?,"Hello! 
I am curious if my short luteal phase might predispose me to other health conditions. 

It is 8 days long in my 26-27 day cycle (consistent over 22 cycles excluding 2 outlier cycles).

Other info:
I am 31 years old, female, 165cm tall, 80kg (a lot of which is muscle, my bloodwork and blood pressure etc are all fantastic), Caucasian. 

I was diagnosed with PCOS 6ish years ago while we were trying to conceive, a year before I became pregnant with my now 4yo daughter. At the time my periods were Infrequent (every 2-3 months) after coming off birth control after 10 years (levernogestrel/ethinylestradiol 150/30). 

I have had no miscarriages, the only time I have been pregnant was successful, I had hyperemesis gravidarum and she was born at 35+4 (4-5 weeks premature. It‚Äôs a real estimate though because my periods were so out of whack the doctors basically guessed when implantation etc occurred based on the size of the embryo). 

I breastfed for 2.5 years. Since stopping breastfeeding my cycles have been very consistent. I experience changes in cervical mucus, libido, acne, and bowel movements like clockwork every cycle which is something I‚Äôve never experienced before.  

I experience the most slightest pink tinged discharge a few days before my period actually begins.

So, other than problems conceiving and carrying a pregnancy to term, are there any consequences for having a shorter luteal phase?",2,1,2019-11-21,premature birth,234,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,Laminectomy d/t lodged epidural catheter,"I was induced for labor in January and after a couple of days and ‚Äúfailure to progress‚Äù I had an emergency c-section. Baby is healthy and great. While I was in labor I had an epidural, so after the c-section the nurse assigned to me said she would remove the epidural catheter from my spine. 

However, it got stuck and only part of the catheter came out. The doctor came by and told the nurse she should have called him if she felt resistance, though she said she hadn‚Äôt felt any.

I had a CT scan that afternoon and the following morning had a laminectomy (spinal surgery) and the rest of the epidural catheter was removed.

The incision is mostly healed and I am able to move about pretty well. However, I am wanting to know what the potential effect of having this spinal surgery is for my body in the future. Are there chances of increased back pain at the area as I age? Is it more susceptible to injury in the future?

I smoke cigarettes twice a day, vape other times.

Period is usually 4-6 days long, 2 super heavy days
Usually comes on time. 
Self diagnosed ibs. Both c and d. 
Last month I had a shadow of a period (2-3 days) that was 6 weeks late. 

For a few years now, perhaps 3 years, I have had extremely painful pelvic or period cramps before, during and after my period. I haven‚Äôt given birth but it feels akin to what I imagine that feels like. My pelvic region feels like it is breaking apart. I also have buttock pain (close to my anus and middle of left buttcheek) and ovary pain. I can really feel my ovaries. They feel tender. The entire left side of my pelvis wraps around in pain. I also get strong rectal spasms and radiating (butt downward) leg pain. 

The pain is so strong I literally bend over my bed and groan, unable to move. My entire body is tense as it washes over me. Boiling hot showers used to help but no longer does. I have cried while holding onto a desk, unable to move. It varies but I can be in pain up to 3 weeks out of the month. I would say it is fairly consistently an 8 on a scale of 1-10, assuming natural childbirth is a 10. Don‚Äôt know, haven‚Äôt experienced. 

I have been to a gynecologist 2 years ago. She ran all the blood tests, ultrasound, even an endometrial biopsy (which should not be allowed to be performed without going under it was that painful). NOTHING. No cysts or fibroids. No hormonal issues. Endometrial biopsy showed nothing. There was a passing mention of a tilted uterus. Nothing to worry about. Obviously the only thing they couldn‚Äôt really test was endometriosis. She gave me a wack ass prescription pain medication for period cramps. It did not work. I take 4 Advil‚Äôs which take about an hour to kick in and stops working 4 hours in. I take another 4. This continues for weeks.  I have a heavy period for 2 days, large clots, then it tapers off quickly. Period ends at 4-6 days usually, the pain continues. It is so bad I have often considered going to the ER multiple times, except I know they will just give me pain meds and a bill. 

I went to a gastroenterologist. I did not get a colonoscopy but they took a stool sample and said it was fine. I have self diagnosed myself with ibs. I alternate between C and D it appears. 

My left hip clicks/grinds. So does my right knee and my left ankle. My buttcrack is tilted to the right a bit. Short leg on the right I assume. Possibly fallen arches as my feet are flat. I only carry my bag on my leg shoulder. Right calf is an inch larger than left. Can‚Äôt tell if this means it is stronger or weaker. Pelvic tilt? Gait issues affecting my pelvis?

I‚Äôve googled for years and cannot understand what is wrong with me. Mittleshmerz? kidney problems? Piroformis? Sciatica? All the ibds? Anterior pelvic tilt? Have I developed fibroids or a cyst out of nowhere?  It may be endo. No one seems to believe that is real. What do I do next? 

I suspect passing the overly large clots (way larger than a quarter at times), or possible severe constipation has something to do with the pain during my period. It does not explain why I get cramps before and after. I am highly stressed but I work out a few days a week, varying intensity.  Is there a blood thinning type of medication that would prevent the heavy clots or make them easier to pass?

I could really use some help even if it‚Äôs just a direction to go in. I welcome all ideas. Since I have no health insurance, I cannot visit multiple specialists.

Hi all, I have a question because I‚Äôm in quarantine and have been watching a lot of pregnancy videos for god knows what reason. 

I was just thinking about my family history of difficult childbirth. My grandmother had two stillborn children, and my mom almost died having my sister and I. I think it has to do with no dilation and small hips (the latter of which I thankfully did not inherit) but I am wondering about when I do get pregnant if I can have an elective C section. I know they are not very popular, but I do not know why. I have a lot of anxiety around childbirth, even though I love kids and definitely want at least a couple in the future. The idea of a vaginal childbirth sounds horrific to me, with all the tearing and stretching and whatnot, in addition to my family history of things not going smoothly. 

Are c sections easier? What are the side effects? Why are elective c sections not more common?

AskDocs,Toddler seizures? Or something else?,"Toddler seizures? Or something else?

(Copied from r/epilepsy as I didn‚Äôt know this was a sub that existed at the time)

Hello, I hope this is ok to post, I‚Äôm just looking for a bit of advice. 

My son is 18 months old [1M] and I have noticed he has been doing some things that I‚Äôve found slightly concerning. Namely, he will randomly roll his eyes upwards and (sometimes, not every time) shake his head or similar movements. It only lasts a second or a few at most. He also ‚Äúspaces out‚Äù sometimes but I never really paid much attention to it until recently so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just normal toddler behaviour or if it‚Äôs something else/excessive. Likewise, I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs any other ‚Äòwarnings‚Äô that he does as I‚Äôm a first time mum and always just taken everything as ‚Äònormal‚Äô as I haven‚Äôt had any reason until now to suspect otherwise. 

My partner thinks I‚Äôm over reacting, and says that it‚Äôs just him being ‚Äúnutty‚Äù - admittedly he is a ball of energy so I wouldn‚Äôt be completely surprised if it was just a quirk, but something in me is telling me it‚Äôs not just that. He was also born 2 months premature at 32 weeks, had a 3 week NICU stay but touch wood, no lasting effects (he‚Äôs been walking for months, babbles and says a few words, is very aware and I have no reason to be concerned about any of his development) so I m not sure if that makes a difference, like the possibility of it being more common in premature children? 

Anyone who can give a bit of insight would be thoroughly appreciated. Please feel free to tell me if I‚Äôm being just a paranoid mother, and in the same breath please don‚Äôt refrain from being blunt if you think it‚Äôs a cause for concern.

BabyBumps,Off my meds,"A little back story... I‚Äôve been on Citalopram +/- Xanax since shortly after my daughter‚Äôs birth 5 years ago.  I‚Äôd dealt with anxiety for years prior to that and finally had the courage to ask for help after going through child birth. 

Well... pregnancy and those meds are not recommend by my OB so I‚Äôve been off them since I found out at 5 weeks and am now 13 +4. I asked my doctor about alternatives at my first appointment and she seemed a little avoidant of them so I said I‚Äôd try and tough it out.

It just feels worse and worse the more pregnant I get.  I feel like my partner is trying so hard to be patient with me but my anxiety just has these moments where it‚Äôs through the roof. I have this irrational fear he is going to get sick of dealing with me. I keep worrying about every little thing and most importantly my fuse is SO short I blow up over minor things. After I snap I feel terrible and end up crying or feeling depressed. I know some is normal pregnancy stuff but it‚Äôs so frustrating feeling like I felt pre-medication. 

I‚Äôm debating on asking for medication that is safe during pregnancy but then I get insecure that I‚Äôm being a titty baby. Any experience with this or advise on how to cope? I feel like when I get a  new car in a few weeks that going back to working out will help me some.",2,18,2020-02-09,coping during pregnancy,254,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Excessive nausea/gi symptoms,"Hello doctors of Reddit. I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for the weird formatting. 
I'm am a 28 yo female, 198 lbs, 5'4"", 16 months postpartum with an emergency C-section and other complications during pregnancy including hyperemisis. My gallbladder was removed in 2014. I have year round allergies and take otc Allegra twice a day. Other than that I have no medical hx. I am in nursing school.
My nausea has not gone away since my some as born 16 months ago. I don't vomit anymore but the nausea is still present. I saw my obgyn regarding the nausea and they told me it would go away In June of this year I was having chest pain, what felt like PVCs and nausea. I went to an urgent care and they attributed it to stress and gave me ondansetron sublinqual prn. 
A few weeks ago I started having episodes of severe burning pain in my chest, sweating, light headed and severe nausea. Sometimes, instead of the burning, I will have cramping pain in my abdomen. So far the only thing that helps is lying down for 20-30 minutes. There does not seem to be a trigger and it does not happen exclusively after eating. In fact it's usually completely random.
I work in a hospital as a student nurse and I've been having these episodes. I can't exactly go lie down so I have to power through it. Usually I can go sit and chart which helps. My nausea is getting worse and worse to the point I need to find a bathroom bc I am sure I will throw up (I usually don't, only once or twice). These symptoms are really starting to affect my life. 
I want to know if anyone had ideas. If I can avoid going to a specialist I really need to, at least until I graduate in May.

AskDocs,I have had mild trouble breathing for around a year.,"For a long while now I have felt like my breathing has been labored, but my parents work long hours and I have anxiety which I think may either cause this or make me blow it out of proportion. Just now I've gotten really curious and searched for causes and symptoms of shortness of breath and found a page ***(Link at bottom)*** which describes most of my tendencies pretty well. I saw a few pages and quickly made links between my symptoms and theirs and I have a pretty shot memory so I don't know if I have started to struggle more over time. As I made the links I flared up my anxiety and here I am writing this.

I am 14 years old male, around 5'8'' and 60kg. I experience this everywhere but mostly at home. I take Ritalin LA and regular Ritalin pretty much daily for my ADHD and Melatonin occasionally to help me sleep.

Before you ask, no I'm not a smoker, I haven't had illnesses diagnosed in the past that are related and I am not aware of myself being an asthmatic. The only other problem I have currently is an unconfirmed intolerance to lactose which gives me these foul tasting burps and occasionally nausea. Also, this part might just be the teenager in me, but I have zero motivation to go to sleep and spend most of my nights up until early morning.

The symptoms the site read that I present are:

* High heart rate with chest heaviness
* Chest pain, pressure or palpitations
* Paleness
* Dizziness or sinking sensation
* Fatigue
* Fainting (rarely)symptoms from: [https://www.unitypoint.org/livewell/article.aspx?id=cd526f2e-26d4-4b6c-845a-c215a9ce8aee](https://www.unitypoint.org/livewell/article.aspx?id=cd526f2e-26d4-4b6c-845a-c215a9ce8aee)
* Sudden and random shortness of breath
* Constant Swallowing
* Breathing manually when it occurs
* Worsening when lying down
* Strange floating/sinking feelings/sensations

I have also experienced strange feelings I cannot describe when under stress, seeing specific things or hearing sounds.

I hope this is in depth enough for somebody to know what I'm experiencing so I can find some closure and clarity in this situation. Thank you for your possible help in the future.

NICUParents,Can I continue to use premature formula for a few more weeks?,"I bought few more boxes of premature formula (22 calories) than I needed. The baby is of the right weight to start using normal formula  (18 or 20 calories). Is there anything wrong in continuing to use the premature formula for a few more weeks?

Should I look to dilute it 10% or something?

Any downsides with continuing to use premature formula? Looking at the contents the main difference  between the two formulas (Enfamil) is that premature formula has more protein and the normal one has more carbohydrates

AskDocs,26 year old male with chronic bilateral joint pain,"Hello all. I have been suffering from this for years. I genuinely just want opinions rather than a diagnosis. I'd like to be prepared for my visits with the doctor and specialists.

My symptoms started when I was 20. I first had knee pain then shoulder pain and pain in my upper back and neck. I put this down to working out and old pains from sports. I first noticed the pain when I was working out. I left it alone and saw a chiropractor and Physio during this time. I was tol/generally told that I had muscle imbalances, muscle activation issues and compensation issues. It seemed to make sense at the time.

Fast forward 3 years. I begin to develop pain in my hips and elbows. Now my problem joints start to make noises and grind. I begin to worry and my doctor sends me for an mri of my most painful joints. Both of my shoulders have signs of early osteoarthritis, cysts and snall osteophytes.

I put this down to overuse and continue with regular activities... Fast forward about 2 years later and my pain gets worse. I now feel pain in my hands and fingers and thumbs. Now all of these joints are painful, crack, grind and cause me trouble. I have definitely noticed a significant loss of strength. For example, I can't even hold up a piece of paper without my shoulders burning.

Most of my pain is with movement. The more I do the more it'll hurt. The thing is, even at rest I sometimes notice random jolts of pain and aches to different joints. I don't have much swelling and stiffness is usually fine. I definitely do have osteoarthritis in some of these joints... The thing is why?

I have not done any sort of intense labor. I haven't fallen or been in a major accident but so many of my joints hurt. The key here is that my symptoms are bilateral and they were discovered as such. For example when my thumb pain started, It was in both thumbs. It wasn't one side of the body. I'm at a complete loss as to how I have so much joint pain and damage at such a young age without any traumatic history.

I have done a bloodtest for rheumatoid arthritis. It was clear according to my doctor. My RF says ""<10"" and my CRP says 4.6. In my opinion it has to be something attacking me because so much wear and tear all over the place at such a young age is NOT normal",2,1,2020-01-20,early labor,430,,,,,,,,,

8 infections since June 2019, presenting as Pain in lower left abdomen & pelvis. Is an aching pain and hurts on my perineum when I wipe after using the bathroom. Hurts to put pressure on abdomen. 

I would love any help i can get to figure out what is going on with my chronic lower abdominal pain.

October 2018, At 41 weeks pregnant i was induced, resulting in a csection after 20 hours of labor. It was a traumatic birth, the epidural wore off and I could feel an intense burning when they started the procedure, started to scream and they knocked me out. Baby was 9pds 13oz and healthy. I never had any health issue until after the birth. I have had 7 infections since then without explanation. Here is a breakdown of the past year: 

I recovered from the csection and all seemed relatively fine until June. I had an intense pain in my lower left abdomen, right above my pelvic bone. It feels swollen to the touch. Pelvic exam looks good. Doctor said it was a UTI although I had no other classic symptoms. In house test came back clear, but culture at the lab came back as ‚ÄòGreater than 100,000 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus saprophyticus‚Äô. I‚Äôm given antibiotics.

A month later I have the same pain, again in house comes back clear but lab says ‚Äò 10,000-50,000 CFU/mL of Escherichia coli‚Äô and I‚Äôm diagnosed with another UTI and sent home with antibiotics. 

A month later i have same pain, and doc calls me in antibiotic over the phone with refills to take after intercourse. 

Primary refers me to obgyn, who sends me to pelvic floor therapy (Tens unit kind). 
No improvement and another infection. Just given antibiotics and no culture sent to lab.

Obgyn sends me to obgyn urologist. He does a cystoscopy, which looks good. Sonogram looks good. Sends me to pelvic floor PT with a certified pelvic floor therapist. No improvement and still another infection. I went to my primary to get a culture but the Doc forgot to send it to the lab for testing.

I get pregnant but miscarry at 6 weeks. 

I go to see a new obgyn in hopes new insight can help. Sonogram comes back clear. Pelvic exam is good. He has a Laparoscopic planned for later in the month. He thinks this could not be a UTI at all, but not sure what it could be. 
I have another currently but am waiting for lab results.",2,1,2020-03-06,induced labor,431,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,Where Next?: 3yo seeing ENT for Ongoing Sleep Obstruction,"Hello. I'm looking for some suggestions regarding a long term issue with a male turning 3 years old VERY soon. In the interests of keeping things summised & concise I'll bullet point some facts / routes taken / symptoms etc, so there is overlap but I want to provide the full picture as concisely as possible. Please ask me to elaborate if you would like more in-depth details. I would be very grateful of any diligent readers to share there opinion / suggestion on where to go next.

To today the child has consistent issues with laying flat - and wakes on average 2 to 4 times a night unless upright. Though wakes much more frequently when fighting an infection (for up to 7 weeks often).

Ideally I'm looking for suggestions on investigations or theories. I'd like to state plainly that I'm just looking for avenues of consideration here. Or even additional suggestions on where else to try posting this - or individuals to contact who may have an interest in this case.

ENT have essentially reached there options here, with only an adenoidectomy left to offer (though this was supposed to have been done last year, read on for full details). Could another discipline offer more investigations?

Physical Info:
Age: 3 years old
Weight: 16kg
Current Location: United Kingdom
* Born 9lb 2oz, C-section due to breech presentation - petite mother.
* Mother on Amitriptyline during pregnancy but came off prior to birth.
* Consistently above 95th percentile height & weight, ongoing.
* Bifid uvula, and initially believed to have enlarged adenoids.
* Tongue tie confirmed and treated surgically at 6 months.
* Adenoidectomy planned, but while under tonsillectomy carried out instead.

Medical Observations & Actions:
* Ranitidine given up to 6 months, suspected Silent Reflux (no vomiting).
* Cows Milk Intolerance theory, mother goes vegan, breast milk rarely supplemented by dietary prescription formula.
* Tongue tie surgically resolved.
* Allergen blood tests carried out. Negative. (Dogs present in child's home).
* Adenoidectomy planned - but instead tonsillectomy carried out.
* Child has been on Beconase spray for 4+ months now to some improvement.

Most Prominent Issue at Present:
* Recurrent nasal congestion, usually as part of cold or infection. Almost always with thick green mucus with pungent smell.
* Child snores and gasps when layed flat sleeping (foam wedge employed to some relief). Wakes 2 to 3 times a night without congestion. When congestion is present wakes 5+ times a night.
* Child is consistently tired due to long standing sleep disruption. Focus is very limited. Emotionally volatile compared to peers at nursery and tolerance much lower. Yawns consistently through the day and now his communication skills are developing he reports tiredness often.
* Child often wakes in the morning very unsettled / crying. Takes several hours of on and off tantrums over minute things and is overwhelmed with great ease.

Symptoms Chronologically:
* 0 - 3 days: 9lb 2oz born breach C-section (petite mother), kept in for additional inpatient observations, very unsettled including with midwives, paediatric visit: baby given sugar-water mix to settle but effects wore off within minutes
* 3 months+: ranitidine given due to continued unsettling especially when laid down. Baby consistently unsettled unless upright.
* 6 months: tongue tie identified and separated. Very quick recovery but no real change to aforementioned unsettling.
* 6+ months: GP suggests cows milk intolerance, mother goes vegan, baby predominantly breast feeding but is supplemented with very occasional prescription specialist formula without dairy.
* 9+ months: child begins to develop a clockwork routine of severe congestion. Each bout lasts for 7 weeks, with scarcely a week of lessened symptoms between. These run back to back, like a well run train, including to today (child is nearly 3 years old).
* 18 months: engaged with general paediatrics & ENT. Behavioural ruled out & sleep study undergone. Deemed not to be full sleep apnoea, but there is evidence of obstruction. Adenoidectomy planned, but instead tonsillectomy is carried out.
24+ months: brief respite from back to back congestion / infections, but have returned by now until almost 36 months.
* Child has been on antibiotics 5 times in the last 18 months.

I'll end this here, though I reiterate: please do ask for greater details on any of these points. I'm happy to provide as much information as possible. This has effected the child so deeply for so long and I fear the current department either haven't grasped the extent of this, or the focus has been too great on one area, and perhaps somebody here reading this will have a fresher perspective or an idea of another department to seek referral to.

Many thanks for your time.",2,3,2019-10-11,full term birth,786,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,Stressed about announcing pregnancy to a friend with whom I have a relationship that I've been reconsidering...,"I have a friend (who I'll call Sally) with whom my relationship is quite complex at the moment, but it's all on my end. The issue is that she considers us to be much closer than I feel to her, and I know that what contributed to this is that I tend to be a people pleaser. I've gotten much better about this in recent years, but because I still struggled in this area when I first met her, our relationship was set on a precedent where I pretty much said yes to a lot of her initiatives to hang out with some degree of regularity. This, of course, in addition to me engaging in frequent conversation with her via text message contributed to her perception that we are very close friends.¬†What made it harder for me to say no to her is that she is high maintenance in that she is very sensitive.¬†

Anyway, over the past year or two, I've gradually realized that she and I are more different than are similar, so I never feel like I can be my true self when around her. It's become clear to me that it's not fair to her to be in this more one-sided friendship. In the past 2 weeks, I've been trying to figure out how to best handle this situation, and then lo and behold, I find out that I'm pregnant exactly one week ago.¬†  
I have another friend who got her BFP two weeks before me. This friend and Sally do not know each other at all, so I casually mentioned to Sally that a friend of mine just got her BFP.  Sally's response was, ""I'm glad she told you. It's so important even in those early days.""¬†  
Based on this, I know she'd be hurt/offended if I waited until 12 weeks+, but then again, if I tell her at the 5 or 6 weeks mark or so, will this just be another thing to cement into her mind that she and I are as close as she perceives?¬†  
I may be stressing about this unnecessarily, but I'd love some advice on how to handle this situation.",2,5,2019-11-04,pregnancy stress,362,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,"Late pregnancy, frequent cramps - looking for relief","Hi all,
Posting for my wife.
Our due date is supposedly in 2 days.
However her cervix hasn't opened and the baby hasn't dropped.

Last night she has started cramping frequently and painfully, and it hasnt stopped all day. 
We went to the ob this afternoon and he checked and her cervix is still closed and the baby hasn't dropped. 
So he said these aren't real contractions.  I guess they are Braxton hicks. 

Tonight They seem to be coming faster. 
I'm starting to write them down.  They might not be 5 1 1 but I bet it is close.  But It's hard to believe things shifted that much in 8 hours. 

If these are just frequent Braxton hicks, does anyone have any recommendations/advice? It's tough to just sit here and watch. 

Any advice is much appreciated.


EDIT:  We hit 5 1 1 and went to the hospital.  The baby hadn't dropped,nor had her water broken.  We tried to walk for several hours and no change - we went and got checked every few hours.  During one of the checks they noticed that the baby's heart beat started dropping a bit during some contractions   We did a c-section and the umbilical cord was wrapped around the baby's neck, which was holding the baby up.

It‚Äôs a long story so I‚Äôll keep it simple. My girlfriend and I were having sex until the condom broke on us and we immediately started considering what to do.  We decided on getting a plan b from the cvs down the street. Once we got it however we thought we might as well try sex without a condom if were going to use the plan b anyways. Long story short I finish (not inside her), we clean up and she takes the plan b within 5 minutes. The next day she got her period and is lying down naked on the bathroom floor with excruciating stomach pains with her mom right next to her. She said it was the worst pain she‚Äôs experienced in a long time. Along with the abdominal she has no appetite and is very sore among her abs from working out, which is why I believe the pains could have been so painful. Last night she was at work going to the bathroom and found a piece of the condom in her vagina. She immediately called me and I tried to calm her down and say we did everything we were supposed to do and she will be ok. Right now she is still very nervous and uneasy about the whole situation. I‚Äôm trying my best to calm her down and assure her nothing bad will happen as there was no actual cum involved in the raw sex only precum (not to mention I barely went in as I was unsure about doing it), she got her period the next day and is still on it, and we took a plan b as soon as we could after having unprotected sex.

AskDocs,Can't Breathe,"Hi all, 

24F, 5'5"" approx. 200lbs. Former smoker, quit over a year ago. No history of chronic physical illness aside from heart palpitations/tachycardia episodes. Take 50 mg Labetalol daily for this. 34 weeks + 4 days pregnant, due May 25. Normal, healthy pregnancy but baby previously measured large. 

The issue is that, for the last 4 weeks, I have felt like there is someone sitting on/squeezing my chest. It starts each day anywhere between 1 and 3 hours after I wake up and continues indefinitely throughout the day. I've been home due to covid-19 and my pregnancy, I'd previously worked directly with the community. It's the most I've been home since we moved into our apartment a couple months back. 

Some details: 

‚Ä¢ I live in Wyoming. 

‚Ä¢ I've become allergic to my guinea pig because pregnancy is weird. Our place has a lot of dust too so we thought maybe allergies. Tried Claritin and Benadryl. I take both daily. Mixed results.

‚Ä¢ My former OB had recommended I try an inhaler so I did. It does not offer relief. He brushed me off otherwise. 

‚Ä¢ Sitting up or lying on my back makes it worse. Laying on my side on the floor helps somewhat. Lying in front of a fan usually helps.

‚Ä¢ I have been tested (negative) for flu and RSV at Urgent Care. This was the last time anyone listened to my lungs/heart. 

‚Ä¢ I have a long history of anxiety and panic disorder. New OB suggests I take Benadryl for anxiety. It makes me tired but does not help otherwise. New OB does not want anything to do with helping the mental health issues; suggested seeing a psychiatrist. 

‚Ä¢ Seeing a psych Monday.

Does anyone have any ideas? Anything? I'm losing my mind here with this and it seems like every medical professional I've seen shrugs me off after giving me a half-assed response. Thanks guys.

AskDocs,No period for 11 months. Period. Now period is missing again.,"27/F/360lbs/5'10""/1 pregnancy/bipolar disorder

Date of last menstrual cycle: 11/1/2019 - 6 days

Previous menstrual cycle: 12/13/2018 - 4 days

Quick mention because I've been asked before: I have not had menstrual cramps since my early teen's and my cycle started at 9 years old.

In March of 2019 I was checked for PCOS and they didn't find anything. I had a very healthy pap smear, and ultrasound check up which showed among everything else a healthy follicle produced. 
My husband and I have been trying for another baby for 3 years. No fertility specialists seen or fertility meds taken. 
Prior to May 2019 I was taking 6mg of Risperidone daily and lactating heavily. I still take 80mg of fluoxetine daily. No issues with sex drive or having sex. No vaginal discharge, smells, itching, etc. No issues with dryness or discomfort.

Other than the missed cycles, I've been doing fine physically. Mental health, not so much. I see my psychologist twice a month and my psychiatrist every 10 to 12 weeks. However, in July, I began having intense sobbing sessions 2 to 3 times a week. Crying for so long and hard I had impaired vision for a bit afterwards. No angry or irritable outbursts, no impulsive or manic episodes, just sobbing. My depression dipped once in early September and I stood for an estimated 15 minutes with a loaded sig sauer 226 pressed to my temple but, talked myself down. I have not talked to my mental health professionals about these issues as I already don't enjoy my visits and I know these would make them worse. I am very aware that this is the wrong thing to do and they need to be informed. 

Also, I am normally very tidy and clean. I really enjoy cleaning and organizing but lately, I can barely bring myself to sweep my floors. In general, I find no joy at all in anything. I also ballooned from 250 in August of 2018 to 360 in August of 2019 and have stayed between 359 and 362 since. I do have a scale that weighs up to 400 lbs and I do weigh myself twice a week on Monday and Friday. 

My pregnancy was uneventful. I had difficulty getting pregnant but took no fertility meds, etc. Very healthy baby born, completely natural and I actually impressed (at least I think they were) the medical staff when I was up and walking and using the bathroom without assistance roughly an hour after giving birth. So, if that means anything? IDK.

I did some research on how to treat pink eye and learned that Gonorrhea can have many of the same symptoms. I practice safe sex, but still plan on getting tested since I'm overdue.

AskDocs,Emotional Health,"18F, about 130 pounds, 5‚Äô1. I‚Äôve been struggling with an issue for a while now, but can‚Äôt ever bring myself to talk deeply about it with family or friends. For the past three years at least, I‚Äôve been having a very hard time dealing with emotions. My main issue is when I get emotionally worked up. It really started when I was scared about my drivers ed class in school. I know it sounds like regular jitters, but I was in physical pain before I had that class every day. I would begin to get anxious and then it would feel like someone was running burning ice over my bones. It‚Äôs begun to escalate so whenever I begin to get truly upset I get the same feeling and it just hurts. I haven‚Äôt officially been diagnosed with anxiety or depression, but I strongly believe I have some form of anxiety. I have been diagnosed with Hashimotos hypothyroidism, and am on a medication for that, but the odd ice-burn feeling began a good couple years before I started the medicine and continues after I take the medicine.

AskDocs,I am worried,"A virus has been making its way around my work and home that I assume is some (super-) strain of flu.


My own symptoms began as watery eyes, runny nose, fatigue. Then came waking up with a truly, all consuming, awful headache which I could not properly think and function with until taking a double dose of ibuprofen, along with a scratchy throat and cough that hade me needing a breathing treatment (diagnosed asthmatic at 5 yo; use albuterol; it happened the last 3 days as soon as I woke up- those days, no more tightness or wheezing for the rest of the day).


Today started off the same, but went on to get worse every hour. At this point, I feel like I have been hit by a train, my headache won't go away with meds, exhausted, swollen and painful throat and lymphnodes, fever of 103.6, eyes watery and burning, sinus congestion, chest pain, my head feels like a balloon detached from my body with tingling and random instances of spinning (like when you're extremely drunk), blackness creeps into my vision, my ears suddenly feel as if they're underwater, cough, sweating and chills, difficulty thinking and somewhat impaired motor skills, horrible nausea, vomiting every sip of liquid I try to take in.


From what I remember, and just my own personal ""knowledge"", most of that is typical flu and likely some dehydration. - BUT- I have this tingling and numbness in my arms, hands, legs, and feet. The sensation comes and goes like waves crashing, though since a couple of hours ago, coldness/tingling/numbness is constant in my fingers and part of the underside of my forearm. It is definitely in both hands, but stronger on the right side.


I have asthma, like I said; severe seasonal (something diff in every season); every few months I end up spending a couple of weeks in the hospital having to be given breathing treatments every 1-2 hours (sometimes more), antibiotics, and steroids--it happens 2-3 times a year, always starts off as a cold and quickly becomes bronchitis or pneumonia, treatment is the same every single time; o2 usually hovers around low 50s to mid 60s for a few days (that's *with* treatment).... And I have allergic reactions to penicillin, amoxicillin (sp?), and levoquin (sp?) 


I also have schizoaffective bipolar disorder; OCD; anxiety w/panic attacks; adhd


I have advanced lumbar stenosis and 2 ruptured disc's (also lumbar) ; I had 3 facial reconstructive surgeries (the last one was sometime before 2005); and I have had 3 natural births (second was a complicated pregnancy and complicated birth; third was one month premature); no recent physical trauma/injury


Used heavy drugs (all of them-wasn't picky) from a young age, picked up drinking hardcore in 2012; was physically dependant on opiates, benzos, and alcohol until 2016-ish (went through many cold-turkey withdrawals that were accompanied by seizures and other really great stuff)


Currently, daily, take: zyrtec, geodon, zoloft, suboxone, klonopin, and adderall, *have taken one breathing treatment /day for 3 days in early morning (tbh I just take the treatment until the asthmatic symptoms are gone, then save the rest of the solution for next time. I am running low and it is expensive) - - - have taken ibuprofen once a day for 3 days (mornings)


That is everything that I can think of that anyone might want to know about my health... It has taken most of the evening to be able to complete this post because I just feel like I'm dying...


If you need anymore information, just ask. Idc what people think about me anymore regarding my medical and substance abuse history. It is what it is.



Just for clarification : my biggest worries are the extremity numbness/coldness/tingling, and also just the severity of all of my symptoms. I have extensive experience being sick, and have had the flu before, but this is just really intense and frightening. No one who I know who has been sick with similar symptoms recently has  been affected this severely.... (if you are going to basically tell me I am a crybaby or just not able to handle the same severity of symptoms as most other people, just save it. I am a pro at powering through and this is not typical + I have a few things going on, like the spinning head and blackness in my vision and the numb/cold/tingle extrems, that no one else I know has had).

She took an easy rest of the day, resting a little, and working from home. Then today (Wednesday), overnight, she woke up with her feet normal again.

AskDocs,R/ChronicIllness sent me here. 23F and sick as all heck,"Hello doctors and fellow sick folks. You can call me Strider, Strides, SickBish, whatever. 
Im a 23 yr old female, and a year ago I was pretty healthy. At least I felt I was. Never got that sick, flus and infections lasted very little time, always bounced back quickly. Aside from a few issues here n there (Insane allergies, a bought of ammonia poisoning from cleaning a guys house that broughton a HORRIBLE migraine) I have been HEALTHY. 
now? Oh boy. 

I'd say it started in July 2019. I first started noticing weightloss. Granted at first I assumed it was because its summer and I am more active. However this weightloss continued, its now November, and I have dropped from 130lbs to barely 102lbs. Well over the normal rate and with no signs of stopping. This includes symptoms such as: Hair loss, Heart palpitations, night sweats where i wake up freezing, headaches (behind the left eye) that are sharp and very painful, im now coughing up brown spotted phlegm (i just quit smoking because of this too. WebMD is terrifying and I regret looking)

 EDIT: i am coughing up more brown spotted, thick phlegm, sometimes its just straight up brown and very dark. Its definitely phlegm/sputum, not mucus from my sinus, and I have been told its old blood trapped in my lungs. Is this true??? 

 my appetite is ruined. Im fatigued, nauseous, puking randomly, pale as all heck, and when I do eat, I get sweaty and sick. Because of the weightloss I have been forcing myself to eat, but it makes me ill and upset everytime. I am 5'1"" at MOST and usually weigh 120-130lbs. I can see my ribs. My collarbone. My hipbones. My pants dont fit and I have NEVER been this small except when i was 19 and diagnosed with Severe Depressive disorder. This is being managed VERY WELL and I gained my weight back in two months after starting proper medication. 

My old GP just kept sending me for pregnancy tests (3 of them and then insisted on an STI check. Ive been celibate for 2 years and Im a lesbian) and then sent me to an entirely different doctor. I live in northern BC and the NHS is lacking in my area, and the new GP was going to make me wait a month for results on the 20th of november. I said screw that and drove 2hrs to a NEW NEW gp. He ran a bunch of brand new tests and it came back clear within this week. xrays, ekg, bloodwork for my glucose and thyroid all came back normal. Im waiting on a scope now but my nagging fear is that we missed something. Is it in my mouth? my lungs? my throat? Now the gp is now bringing up colon cancer, so i have a stool sample to do as well. However if the scope and the sample come back clear, this new new GP wants to chalk it up to stress. ""Just stress.""

I really don't believe this is just stress. I have had medical issues in the past that were chalked up to ""oh you have an anxiety disorder, its That."" (Ie my migraines from cleaning a hoarders house. surprise; i was actually sick.) I dont seem to have a deficiency. Im really scared its going to turn out to be something worse, however Im even more scared these tests are going to be nonconclusive and yet again, im going to be told to change my meds or ""you just need to learn to relax."" I have already talked to my paych and my CM, I have been managing my mental health better than ever. Sure I am stressed now, but of course I am, my health is failing and my hair is falling out. Im wasting away and no one knows why. I am going to be devastated if yet again I'm told ""oh well you're just stressed and didnt realize.""

Should I find a specialist? Get more tests? Im at a loss and I'm waiting on this scope and stool sample but I don't want to give up here when I'm certain something is wrong with my BODY, not my mental health. and im certain its my BODY. I really am.

AskDocs,"Misdiagnosed/Undiagnosed Chronic Intestinal pain, suggestions please? (24/M, 5 years, White)","Good evening! I want to ask after a friend of mine who has been suffering from chronic gastric pain for nigh on 5 years now. He's been to four gastroenterologists so far and had his gallbladder taken out with no success and no results, but I recently convinced him to go take a test for porphyrias and got an interesting result back! Regarding relevant patient info, I can tell you that he is 23-24 years old, male, white, obese/overweight (281 lbs, down from 350 when he was first diagnosed), height over 6"" and lives down South. He's taken **Elavil** (amitriptyline) but stopped after he didn't feel any different months into the treatment. He also smokes weed regularly in order to cope with the pain symptoms, but he's also quit and gone cold turkey for a month before in order to see if it was related to the weed. According to him, there were no major changes.   


So first of all, he says his problem has been going on since he was 18. He has suffered from **chronic, diffuse stomach pain** around his core area, centering on the right-hand region his gallbladder had been. It doesn't seem to move beyond his stomach. He describes it as burning and ranging from 3-8 on a scale of 1-10 in terms of pain. In combination with this pain, he has **fatigue**, **bloating**, **chronic diarrhea**, which is either bright yellow and loose or dark, smelly and condensed, nausea (also on a level of 3-8) and connected with a hospital visit he had to go to in 2018, a ""**weirdly high heart rate**"". I personally also believe that whatever he has is tied to his **depression**, either causing it indirectly or directly influencing his mental health. Some days he seems pretty alright, but other days it's very very bad, which is why I'm asking your help.  


He has told me that he has some triggers, but avoiding them isn't enough to stop the pain. He has told me that the nausea is present the strongest in the morning and after eating or on an empty stomach. He vomits until there is bile, and there is occasionally blood in that vomit. He has also mentioned heat, pressure, stress and drinking too much water being triggers for greater chronic pain; and from past accounts of his, I'm inclined to believe that sickness is a trigger as well. The hospital/ER visit he went to in 2018 was tied to salmonella, and a cold that a friend gave him severely triggered whatever it was that he was suffering from.

On his journey, he's attempted several treatments--an anti-nausea pregnancy wristband which worked until it didn't. A TENS unit which did not work. Gallbladder removal, Elavil, and a low FODMap diet. According to him, the FODMap diet has helped him somewhat with his diarrhea, which is why he's still on it. 

The concerning thing is that he has not been able to find anything out about whatever he's suffering from for a long time. All tests come back normal. He's had an abdominal MRI, multiple stool and blood tests, gastroscopy and colonoscopy, as well as an intestinal biopsy. The doctors apparently have not found anything aside from the fact that he has no inflammation and does not guard his stomach when touched. They have apparently definitely ruled out IBS and Crohn's.  


His current diagnosis is one of exclusion; his doctor believes he has Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome as no other tests have returned anything thus far. I don't think that's the right diagnosis, and I recently got him to take a 24-hour urine test specifically for porphyrias. According to that test, he has high COPROPOR I and COPROPOR III levels, although not enough to be multifold. **CPI is around 30ug where the reference interval is 0-24ug, and CPIII is around 88ug where the reference interval is 0-74ug.** I think it might be related to his liver but I'm not sure if there's anything specific.   


He just wants to know what it really is; and I do too. He'll be visiting his fifth gastroenterologist on Monday and I'm really anxious about making it a productive visit. Please help us!",1,5,2020-02-23,mental health during pregnancy,695,,,,,,,,,

I have asthma, like I said; severe seasonal (something diff in every season); every few months I end up spending a couple of weeks in the hospital having to be given breathing treatments every 1-2 hours (sometimes more), antibiotics, and steroids--it happens 2-3 times a year, always starts off as a cold and quickly becomes bronchitis or pneumonia, treatment is the same every single time; o2 usually hovers around low 50s to mid 60s for a few days (that's *with* treatment).... And I have allergic reactions to penicillin, amoxicillin (sp?), and levoquin (sp?) 


I also have schizoaffective bipolar disorder; OCD; anxiety w/panic attacks; adhd


I have advanced lumbar stenosis and 2 ruptured disc's (also lumbar) ; I had 3 facial reconstructive surgeries (the last one was sometime before 2005); and I have had 3 natural births (second was a complicated pregnancy and complicated birth; third was one month premature); no recent physical trauma/injury


Used heavy drugs (all of them-wasn't picky) from a young age, picked up drinking hardcore in 2012; was physically dependant on opiates, benzos, and alcohol until 2016-ish (went through many cold-turkey withdrawals that were accompanied by seizures and other really great stuff)


Currently, daily, take: zyrtec, geodon, zoloft, suboxone, klonopin, and adderall, *have taken one breathing treatment /day for 3 days in early morning (tbh I just take the treatment until the asthmatic symptoms are gone, then save the rest of the solution for next time. I am running low and it is expensive) - - - have taken ibuprofen once a day for 3 days (mornings)


That is everything that I can think of that anyone might want to know about my health... It has taken most of the evening to be able to complete this post because I just feel like I'm dying...


If you need anymore information, just ask. Idc what people think about me anymore regarding my medical and substance abuse history. It is what it is.



Just for clarification : my biggest worries are the extremity numbness/coldness/tingling, and also just the severity of all of my symptoms. I have extensive experience being sick, and have had the flu before, but this is just really intense and frightening. No one who I know who has been sick with similar symptoms recently has  been affected this severely.... (if you are going to basically tell me I am a crybaby or just not able to handle the same severity of symptoms as most other people, just save it. I am a pro at powering through and this is not typical + I have a few things going on, like the spinning head and blackness in my vision and the numb/cold/tingle extrems, that no one else I know has had).

AskDocs,Non stop palpitations after exertion. Could low ferritin or a hiatial hernia cause this?,"28yo female 5‚Äô2 220lbs(working on it have lost 15 already)

Today I had a stress test due to these strong palpitations after exertion, every other beat or sometimes 5 in a row, continually for at least an hour, which have been going on almost 3 years now, with no pattern disturbance, happens like clockwork after any exertion, couple times a week. Of course they didn‚Äôt happen until I got in my car to go home. Decided to just drive next door to the ER, the doctor there didn‚Äôt even look at the monitor and just said to call my cardio. Cardio suggests beta blockers but I‚Äôd rather continue searching for the cause of this until I‚Äôve exhausted all possibilities.

I guess my questions are these:

1. Could a hiatial hernia or stomach dislocation cause heart palpitations only from exertion? I ask this because it gets better if lay down, and comes right back if I sit up. It also gets worse if I drink or eat anything after activity. Sometimes also if I bend down not during activity I get some strong palps. I also have a history of bulimia and these attacks started after pregnancy which I gained a lot of weight, a lot.
2. I was anemic after birth, and they did start directly after birth. My iron and rbc levels were normal not long after. I never had my ferritin tested until a few weeks ago and it was 40. My saturation in April was 45% everything else normal. What chance do you think the low ferritin level is causing this?",1,2,2019-11-16,stress during pregnancy,264,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,"Multiple Rheumatologist visits, maybe it is all in my head. Just need to know if bloodwork may point to some validation??","Okay, I'll try not to make this super long while trying to include relevant information. I've been dealing with a handful of symptoms, off and on, for a couple of years now. I am 31F, white, 5'8 140 lbs, mom x 4. No meds, couple drinks every other weekend, no smoking/drugs. Decent exercise.



January of 2018, I went to my family doctor for first time in 6 years. Mostly for joint pain and stiffness in my hands, knees, feet - ongoing 2.5 months. Hands were worst-felt like a rubberband holding fingers tight. Also complained of always being tired and bad headaches daily. Dr. said to exercise more and I was tired because I had 4 young kids. Ran blood work and calls me and says ""Your blood work is in, it looks like you have lupus. I'm sending you to a rheumatologist."" Positive ANA and positive for Anti-DNA (DS) AB QN @ 13 (reference range was 0-9). RNP antibodies was .9 with reference range of 0-0.9.



Symptoms that MAY be of note: headaches (pain stems from my jaw and wraps around the back of my head), always 2/day. Horrible hip and back pain (assumed this was just my life now after 2 babies back to back). One hip tends to get kind of stuck with certain movements, and I have to work it back in place slowly. A couple of my ribs move out of place (a low one on each side) when I bend certain ways (super painful, but I can push them back in and they will just be a little tender for a bit after) - only maybe once a month. Pain in my fingers, wrists, feet, knees, shoulders (mostly dull ache or stiffness, nothing I can't live with).



Random other things of note: a couple of small spots inside my nose that will not heal up and go away. They scab over, eventually the scab will break free when I blow my always semi-runny/stuffy nose, and then they are just a sore again. My rheumatologist said I probably have Hidradenitis Suppurativa, due to two boils on my butt that never completely heal (and 2 smaller ones on panty line). Horrible face acne for the past few years. My husband thinks the redness on my face looks like the butterfly rash (only red sometimes, not usually bothersome). A different rash that would come and go but I never thought much of it. Anxiety/depression have been a battle off and on for years, but I had been pretty good on that front for years until all of this kind of brought it back.



Saw rheumatologist and that appointment was kind of humiliating. Most symptoms had settled down significantly since appt with family doc. I felt like a fool. He didn't read my list of symptoms (and disregarded many that I told him), but prescribed meloxicam 10mg and ordered blood work. Told me right off that my family doc shouldn't have said lupus, because it was probably false positives. This was March 2018. 

His blood work came back, ANA negative - titer <1:40. RNP antibody negative, >20 EIA value. Only positive was HISTONE ANTIBODIES @ 3 EIA value (>1.5 is strong positive). That and signs of a UTI. He didn't answer when I asked about the Histone antibodies (I hadn't been on medication to indicate drug induced lupus). He said I could have an autoimmune disease, but we may very well never know what. But definitely didn't look like lupus.



Next winter, I had been dealing with a rash. It was sporadic and only came on at night (except for like 3 times), multiple nights a week. It was deep red, clear lines, and after it came on it didn't spread. It didn't itch, but I would have labored breathing every time (just like I couldn't catch my breath). Rash would last about 2 hours and be gone. Changed everything we could think of in case of an allergic reaction. No change. This went on for about 3 months while some of the joint pain and stiffness returned. 



Went to see a rheumatologist/allergist in Jan 2019 to try to sort out the rash. She was pretty sure it was the wine I drank a couple nights a week. But it wasn't only when I drank wine. And it wouldn't always happen then. She didn't think it was anything else. But she did order an AVISE CTD test through exagen labs. 



ANA IgG Positive @ 35 units (reference range on testing says ELISA 20-59 - Positive). The Titer was left blank. No nuclear pattern and no cytoplasmic pattern observed.

Anti - carbamylated Protein IgG Positive @ 35 units (reference range says ELISA >20 - Positive). Everything else negative except for UTI-looking #s in urine again. I've had UTI half my life, usually not bothered.

Metabolic panels, CBC, etc all within normal ranges. Hand X-Rays showed no signs of significant abnormalities. 



Lost my insurance in early 2019. Just got on government insurance. Hands are getting very painful and stiff again. Pain in first knuckle of big toe often again. Fatigue is constant again. Rashes barely coming up any more. But my damn hands hurt!! I just want to know if it is worth going back to the rheumatologist based on my blood work or if I am a hypochondriac. If I am a hypochondriac, I can accept that and deal with it and live through the aches. No big deal, I've done it for years. But if my blood work looks like there could be a real problem with me, I want to see another dr so that I can be a better mom and wife. The rheumatologists I've seen didn't seem concerned with my blood work, but my anxiety is telling me to point it out to someone!

AskDocs,OB questions,"Hi!

I would like to preface my questions by stating that I am intending to get a second opinion but currently am waiting for some of this covid mess to clear up. Also, I am a family nurse practitioner but this is my own health and not my area so I would really value some objective feedback.

36f, g1p1L1. 

Premature rupture of membranes, GBS positive, midwife directed augmentation attempts X11 hours failed to start labor, transfer to hospital. Pitocin overnight by 8 am (\~24 hours PROM) had not had a break from the contractions in over 1.5 hours was trying not to cry. Intrauterine pressure monitor inserted - determined that uterus was not relaxing between contractions. Got epidural and they dialed back the pitocin a lot. Rested a few hours - complete, complete by early afternoon. Attempted to labor down the rest of the day. pushed 1.5 hours, rested 1 hour pushed almost 2 hours. Foreceps attempt - unable to get one of the paddles in between the baby and my pelvis Agonizing experience even with the epidural. All this an he only got down to +1 station. 

C-section key statements from report paraphrased:

low transverse - midline extension and far lateral extension to ""within millimeters of right uterine artery."" No imbricating layer (not exactly sure what that means but she told me she could only do 1 layer of sutures). Hemostasis eventually achieved (900 ml loss). 

What I want to know:

How common is it to need to do both a T and a J incision in the same uterus/delivery? 

Was it because the PROM with OP positioning?

How common is it to have only 1 layer of suture?

How safe is it for me to try to have any more babies?

	Are these studies enough to merit having an ultrasound to monitor wound healing?

AskDocs,"8 months postpartum, unexplained weight loss","34F

5‚Äô5‚Äù Weight steady at 174lbs (pre pregnancy and up until 4-5 weeks ago). Now 163lbs.

8 months postpartum, healthy pregnancy, c-section delivery due to fetal distress. Baby on solids but continues to breastfeed 5-7 times a day.

Exercise 3-5 times a week. Dairy free diet due to baby having an intolerance, but have started to reintroduce it into my diet within the last 2 weeks. Not a lot of snacking or eating out due to pandemic.

PMhx: Depression & anxiety (well managed with therapy and 75mg sertraline OD), migraines rarely (no meds). Otherwise healthy. No known allergies.


I have lost 11 lbs in the last month unintentionally (was planning to wait until finished breastfeeding to try to lose weight). While I am happy to be heading to a healthier weight, I am concerned as I haven‚Äôt been attempting weight loss. I‚Äôve had night sweats off and on since giving birth (currently getting them nightly) and the last couple weeks I‚Äôve been very nauseous. I have thrown up a few times, and feel sick after eating most meals. I don‚Äôt have much of an appetite currently.

I have taken many pregnancy tests and they‚Äôve all been negative.

I just had my first postpartum period 2 weeks ago and around that time also started slowly reintroducing dairy into my diet. Before and during my period my appetite definitely increased.

I don‚Äôt want to go to the doctor if it isn‚Äôt needed due to the current climate, but it‚Äôs always been drilled in my head that unexplained weight loss and night sweats = trouble, so I‚Äôm a little nervous.

Other than the nausea issue and night sweats I feel well. No fatigue, no other symptoms I‚Äôve noticed.

I would love to know if this can be explained by hormones and/or diet and/or pandemic stress, or if I should see my family doctor (and if so can it wait).

Thank you so much!",1,4,2020-04-18,stress during pregnancy,320,,,,,,,,,

I was told by two different doctors in my youth (once at ~10 and once at ~18) that I do not have Marfan's. They had me do the wrist and thumb tests, but nothing more.

My PVCs started in 2018. I had an echocardiogram done when getting my PVCs investigated (in 2018). They said my valves and etc were all looking normal.

However, I keep hearing about these ""signs"" that I posted photos of, and wonder if I really *do* have it.

I am: slim built, long-fingered, long-faced, long-everything'd, high palate, combined scoliosis.

But I also have: high foot arches (not flat), not flexible in my legs (can't touch my toes), not *too* bad eyesight (I don't need my glasses when reading or at the computer, half my family has much worse).

Speaking of family: My dad's side is ALL extremely tall and lanky. My female cousin has Ehlers-Danlos. My dad has detached both his retinas and has ""a big heart"" and a murmur- but he is not diagnosed with anything (he avoids doctors).

I wouldn't be worried about it except for the whole ""your heart could literally explode at any minute"" thing.

I'm also looking to have kids in the near future, so I am also concerned that if it goes undetected, it could end badly there.

So, what do you think, docs? Should I ask my new PCP to look more seriously at it, or am I just lanky?",1,4,2020-04-08,premature birth,335,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,long abdominal pain,"hi I‚Äôm 18f, 5‚Äô5, 117lbs, white
recently I‚Äôve been having some abdominal pain that hasn‚Äôt gone away. I started having them last Friday the 27th. I thought maybe it was me ovulating, bc I normally flush out during ovulation and it was my fertile window at the time, but I rarely get related cramps. A day later however I noticed maybe it wasn‚Äôt ovulation cramps but my colon, so I took some Dulcolax in hope maybe I‚Äôm just constipated. Well it didn‚Äôt work until the following day, the 29th, yet it‚Äôs still there this morning (30th) and I can‚Äôt sleep bc it‚Äôs still painful. 
I can‚Äôt seem to determine where the pain is coming from. I feel it everywhere in the abdomen and pelvic region. I‚Äôve been letting out gas but it‚Äôs not enough. 

Some background is that I had unprotected sex March 7th, 4 days before my period. I did end up getting my regular length period (7 days). Though due to stress I have different flows, but with some of the worst cramps ever. It‚Äôs typical for me. My bf didn‚Äôt even finish and we only did it for a couple minutes bc I thought I might pass out, so I know my possibilities of getting pregnant was low. Even then i don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs possible to get pregnant with no ejaculation, plus an egg that‚Äôs already going through the process of shedding with the lining. I can‚Äôt go out and get a pregnancy test due to city lockdown, but idk if it‚Äôs necessary. 
Also since lockdown I‚Äôve been missing breakfast. Probably my most important meal when school was going on, but no longer wake up for it. but food consumption has been alright, I‚Äôm not overeating and not taking in as much junk food. 

What could this pain be from? 
Ovulation? Constipation? Pregnancy? They all seem to blend together with what I‚Äôm dealing with. I truly don‚Äôt know and it‚Äôs been keeping me up for the past 4 days. 
I appreciate all advice and comments, just trying to eliminate my options here. Thank you.

I'm a 43yo female, I don't drink, don't smoke, I'm not obese (5'7  163lbs) I exercise regularly, I have a genetic disposition to diabetes which causes me to control my diet since very young and I take metformin (slow release 1g/day) for insulin resistance. Over the past couple of years I have been experiencing a spike on my blood pressure during my period, I've always retained a lot of liquid during it ever since I was young to the point that ppl would comment on my ""weight gain"" during it and on my ""weight loss"" when it was over, never bothered me until it started to cause this spike on bp, I've been to a cardiologist that asked many tests done, he deemed my heart healthy and dismissed me, I've been to a gynecologist who wanted me to go on the pill which I declined because it always makes me feel worse, I've been to a endocrinologist who asked me for tests and also couldn't find anything wrong, my hormonal levels are always normal (except for vit D which I'm currently taking and triglycerides which sometimes comes slightly over the normal I imagine due to the insulin resistance and spironolactone for my water retention on my period. It doesn't seem to have anything dangerously wrong with me but I have no quality of life, I experience frequent heart palpitations, I wake up in the middle of the night with the heart racing, I'm constantly feeling an uneasy sensation in the chest that I can't describe, and I fear I'll end up having a heart attack even though every test suggested I have a healthy heart. I'm on my last straw here and I want to know if anyone can suggest me another specialty I can look for or another approach to a doctor so I can figure out how to make this symptoms go away (heart palpitations, heart racing, extreme headache even with low bp, spikes in bp - I have a machine and often during these times it can go from 150/90 to 12/90 in one minute) 

Another informations about me: I had a pregnancy at 34 (c-section delivery), don't have any allergies or take any other medications besides metformin and vitamins. My mother is diabetic and has high blood pressure, she went through menopause at around 45 (I think this could be where I'm heading too)

AskDocs,Might neurological effects of hormones be heritable?,"Background:

My mom (65F) has had migraines with auras since puberty.  I don't know her medication history.  I (38F) began getting migraines in my early 20s with auras a few years after starting the pill. I'm wondering the likelihood estrogen will be an issue for my child.

I recall taking orthotricyclen and mircette in 2000-2005 before starting nortrel around 2006. While on nortrel, I had weird neurological symptoms including feeling like gravity was too strong -- I fell in an elevator when it went up and it was really hard to go up stairs. Switching to taking it at night helped, but I eventually stopped it entirely to conceive. I had two children - 2007 and 2010, but can't recall what I used for birth control between them. My second delivery included tubal ligation, but I used nuvaring to even my moods until about 2012 or 13. 

Not including pregnancy, I averaged one ""migraine"" with auras per year. I believe they began while taking nortrel, but they were mild at first - only auras, then a nap. Then I began having a ""bruised"" feeling after the nap. But each was worse than the last and they were severe by 2012. That's when a friend mentioned that if I get auras, I shouldn't be taking hormonal b.c.  My ob/gyn was horrified that I hadn't mentioned my migraines and discontinued the hormones immediately.  I haven't had any auras or light-sensitive headaches similar to the migraines since then. PMDD has been terrible, but I'm given to understand the risk of stroke isn't worth benefits to mood. (I'm already on an SNRI.)

Now my child (12, assigned male at birth) has come out as transgender. Personality-wise, this kid is my mini-me. We've always been on the same wavelength. We are similarly neurodiverse in that we're both aspie (child has formal autism dx, but I do not.) 

Should I fear estrogen for my child, when ready? I worry that the hormone replacement therapy necessary to transitioning medically will lead to debilitating or risky neurological effects. But I don't know differences in dosages, etc. Or how heritable this sort of thing is.  High blood pressure runs on both sides of the family, as well.",1,1,2020-02-16,early delivery,368,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Missed Period after Laporoscopic surgery for Endometriosis,"20F, 5""4 (163cm), about 130 lbs (59 kg) 

I drink about 5 glasses of wine a week now that quarantine has started, depending on the week. 

2 months ago I had the following procedures:
- Hysteroscopy with currettage (they wanted to collect samples from my uterus)
- Not sure what it's called but they put blue dye through my fallopian tubes to check for blockage. No blockage was found
- Laporoscopy with excision of 2 endometriosis lesions on a ligament holding the uterus and in the douglas pouch.

2 months before the surgery, I stopped taking visanne (0.2mg dienogest), as instructed by the specialist. I had my regular (horrible) periods again, with my 28 day cycle. My first period after surgery was right on time and business as usual (lots of blood and pain yay).

I was having pain after surgery due to overgrowth of Ureaplasma parvum and gardnarella bacteria. My gyn (specialist post OP appointment was cancelled due to Covid) perscribed me a 7 day course of Doxycycline and Dalacin V. I finished the course about 2 weeks ago. That pretty much cleared up the issue. I am thinking this could be the cause, since this has been the only change since my previous period. 

My 2nd period after the surgery should have happened 10 days ago. But nothing happened. No PMS, no ovulation cramps, nothing.... I had mild spotting (like a couple drops/smear) about 5 days ago but nothing since then. I was worried I could be pregnant, but 3 pregnancy tests have come up negative now. My partner and I only had sex a few times since the surgery, and are relying on condoms. The last time we had sex was 3 weeks ago, so tests should be showing up positive if I was pregnant.

There hasn't been any major changes since my last period. Quarantine has been going on a while, even during my last period. No weight change. No change in stress, or routine or anything in the last couple months. Tbh i'm super happy not to have my period but I am worried what could be causing it. 

Should I be contacting my specialist ? Or my gyn ?

I‚Äôm meeting with a dermatologist tomorrow for advice but it‚Äôs a video conference so I don‚Äôt know how helpful it will be. Hopefully she has some ideas. Does anyone have any ideas on what else this could be and how I can relieve this?

Other medications I‚Äôm on for mental health issues, hypothyroidism and pregnancy that I‚Äôve been on for years:

AskDocs,Question about levels of stress in pregnancy,"26F, 26 weeks pregnant, diagnosed Von Willebrands, diagnosed but well managed for years now Borderline Personality Disorder and Clinical Anxiety, normal pregnancy so far

I work full time as a project manager for an advertising agency. At the moment, my work is verging on unbearable levels of stress for me. I currently have a couple of very large projects for very big global companies that are crashing and burning because of factors out of my control like third party suppliers.

 As the PM I am the face of the project so I take all of the clients and my companies anger about the project not doing well, and I am working incredibly long days trying to get international teams to solve these problems.

I'm not sleeping well, struggling to eat, and I would say I'm running at about 80-90% panic/stress levels basically around the clock at the moment. I'm really genuinely treading water trying to stay afloat.

My question is, people say that stress is bad for pregnancy, but what can it actually do? And when people say stress do they actually mean, like, a loved one dying or something of that magnitude? There's not a lot I can do about my stress levels right now but I'm worried that I might be causing harm.

EDIT: not really worried about me, more worried about if it could harm the baby",1,3,2020-01-27,pregnancy stress,230,,,,,,,,,

AskDocs,"""Whooshing"" sound in my ear and ongoing headaches","[24]F, Height: 5'3 Weight: 145, Race: Caucasian, Duration of complaint: On and off for the last 3-ish years. Location: USA

Any existing relevant medical issues: Diagnosed with Antiphospholipid Syndrome, Anxiety/Depression, Asthma
Current medications: Albuterol (as needed), sertraline (75mg), Low-dose aspirin (81mg)

I'm hoping someone here can help me. My main problem right now is I have this ""whooshing"" pulsing sound in my left ear. I've had this problem on-and-off for the past few years. This sound tends to occur around the same time as when I'm having major headaches, which will be daily and usually last weeks or months. I also used to have painless ocular migraines quite frequently, but I haven't had one in a while. I started another ""headache flare"" (for lack of a better word) a few weeks ago, and have been treating with tylenol to get through the day. Today when I started hearing the sound again, for the first time in a while, I realized I think its my heartbeat, it seems to match my pulse. It is extremely annoying, and makes it very difficult to fall asleep.

My last headache flare was last winter, and it probably lasted a few months. I also had the whooshing sound in my ear quite often (usually left ear, I think), but I didn't know how to describe it to anyone. I went to an urgent care one day when my headache was unbearable, and the doctor said it was probably birth control and gave me some muscle relaxers. I didn't mention the ear thing because I didn't know how to explain it.

A few months later I became pregnant. I lost the baby at 20 weeks June 1, and two sets of blood tests indicate that I have Antiphospholipid Syndrome. I don't know if this is relevant. Hematology is full until December so I don't really have a ""go-to"" person for this other than my OB.

I am seeing a PA on Saturday at my primary care office, but should I be concerned about anything in the short term with this? Could it be related to Antiphospholipid Syndrome, or is it something else entirely? I hate stressing about my health, but I also don't want to visit the doctor more than I need to.

AskDocs,34 year old female pregnant with second child trying to decide whether to have c-section or try for natural delivery after 3A tear in birth of first child 4 years ago,"
- no fecal incontinence
- some very mild urinary stress incontinence
- 3A tear I think occured due to positioning and baby size. I had a midwife assisted delivery in a midwife run unit within a hospital. Baby got a bit stuck and I think was in distress so I was encouraged to squat over a birth stool. Then they said something about him being a bit stuck (not sure if it was a shoulder) but they used their hands to pull him out. Baby weighed 4.2kg. (I think if I was in a normal labour ward I probably would've had an episiotomy or some sort of instruments).
- 6 week check up at the hospital an obstatrician said I should never give birth naturally again due to high risk of worse damage. I've had no other follow up except for recently seeing a pelvic floor physio
- advice so far has been a bit inconsistent. Some of the health professionals have been suggesting I may have a slight increased risk of a tear again but not necessarily, others have been giving me more strong warnings against the idea of a natural birth
- not had anorectal manometry (and may not be able to, the hospital unit where they perform them have said they don't like to do this on pregnant people due to a risk of miscarriage
- current pregnancy IVF due to suspected endometriosis (1st pregnancy spontaneous, thought is hormonal birth control controlled the endo and I never went back on it after birth of my first child)
- maybe also relevant is that I have anxiety. This isn't generally very obvious to others or even to me most of the time these days, but interacting with health professionals I find triggering



Can't fully articulate why but I am really uncomfortable with the idea of a c-section. Maybe the recovery? Maybe feeling detached from the birth? Not sure. First birth I felt really strongly about having as intervention free natural birth as possible, and I still feel a bit attached to this vision. I've always perceived natural birth to be very beneficial to the baby. But, on the other hand, obviously a little scared of a future of feacal incontinence!


My question is am I crazy for even considering a natural birth? I feel like I'm clouded with anxiety right now and can't make a decision. I've got a few months to go but I don't want to be obsessing over this the whole time.

AskDocs,"8 months postpartum, unexplained weight loss","34F

5‚Äô5‚Äù Weight steady at 174lbs (pre pregnancy and up until 4-5 weeks ago). Now 163lbs.

8 months postpartum, healthy pregnancy, c-section delivery due to fetal distress. Baby on solids but continues to breastfeed 5-7 times a day.

Exercise 3-5 times a week. Dairy free diet due to baby having an intolerance, but have started to reintroduce it into my diet within the last 2 weeks. Not a lot of snacking or eating out due to pandemic.

PMhx: Depression & anxiety (well managed with therapy and 75mg sertraline OD), migraines rarely (no meds). Otherwise healthy. No known allergies.


I have lost 11 lbs in the last month unintentionally (was planning to wait until finished breastfeeding to try to lose weight). While I am happy to be heading to a healthier weight, I am concerned as I haven‚Äôt been attempting weight loss. I‚Äôve had night sweats off and on since giving birth (currently getting them nightly) and the last couple weeks I‚Äôve been very nauseous. I have thrown up a few times, and feel sick after eating most meals. I don‚Äôt have much of an appetite currently.

I have taken many pregnancy tests and they‚Äôve all been negative.

I just had my first postpartum period 2 weeks ago and around that time also started slowly reintroducing dairy into my diet. Before and during my period my appetite definitely increased.

I don‚Äôt want to go to the doctor if it isn‚Äôt needed due to the current climate, but it‚Äôs always been drilled in my head that unexplained weight loss and night sweats = trouble, so I‚Äôm a little nervous.

Other than the nausea issue and night sweats I feel well. No fatigue, no other symptoms I‚Äôve noticed.

I would love to know if this can be explained by hormones and/or diet and/or pandemic stress, or if I should see my family doctor (and if so can it wait).

AskDocs,"Do Omeprazole and Pepcid/Zantac heal stomach, or just mask symptoms?","I am 41, female, 5'5"", 150 lbs and no underlying health conditions other than PTSD and anxiety. I'm allergic to everything in the avelox family as well as lexapro and prozac (and doc said to just avoid all SSRI's since lexapro and prozac cause tachycardia), and need to avoid caffeine because it also causes tachycardia (particularly from drinks like Bai and beachbody pre-workout powder).

I had a telehealth appointment with my doctor on Monday (in place of my annual physical until I can safely reschedule), and she told me to take either 2 pepcid/zantac or 1 omeprazole per day for 2 weeks. I am wondering if these drugs actually heal my stomach or simply mask symptoms, a la tylenol not actually healing injuries but instead just masking the pain. I'd rather not take anything if it's just going to mask the symptoms and not actually heal anything. 

I did read this morning that Zantac has been recalled due to increased risk for cancer-causing properties the longer it sits on a shelf(?). I have 4 leftover bottles of omeprazole from when she previously prescribed it to me to take regularly for several months several years ago. Two bottles expired in December 2019 and two expired in February 2020, so I'm using those first. I took one pill yesterday morning on an empty stomach, and one pill this morning on an empty stomach waiting 30 minutes to eat thereafter. So, I'm wondering if I should be ordering a brand new box of pepcid instead of the expired omeprazole. 

I tend to start to get ulcer like symptoms after consuming acidic foods and beverages, which I've had more of lately since I'm not able to be too picky about what food we have in the house now. But I did have a glass of wine and a few ounces of hard cider last week, and a sip of my significant other's coffee, so that probably kicked this into high gear. 

I've been having issues with my food getting stuck in the back of my throat while I'm eating and having to cough it back up a little and take a sip of water to properly swallow it. I mentioned this to my doctor Monday, and she said this is caused by acid reflux. I don't feel particularly refluxy, so I was surprised by this, but happy to try the medication for 2 weeks to see if it helps. She also told me to stop eating fatty foods, cheese, simple white carbs and spicy food, and sugar. 

Doc also prescribed me 0.5 mg of loreazepam, but I can't pick it up, since ""controlled substances"" do not qualify for pharmacy delivery. My daughter and s.o. are high risk, so I refuse to go anywhere in public during this pandemic until it's long over.",1,8,2020-04-02,late delivery,468,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Could it be Neurogenic Bladder Disorder?,"Hey there,

Ok, first I'm a 31yo female, 167cm, 120kg, I have PCOS along with the following. I have a child who was born naturally almost 10 years ago, and do have problems with a prolapse due to birth (36h labour, 2.5h pushing, episiotomy and suction assisted birth). 

So I'm pretty medically sufficient due to having long term and short term health conditions and having a strong interest in anatomy and physiology.

Relevant medical history for this particular issue is Degenerative Disc Disease which has caused nerve root compression from a herniated disc at L4-L5 and nerve root compression from osteophyte formation at L5-S1. This has caused severe chronic pain, severe Sciatic pain and mobility issues. 

So far I have tried several different medications to have with the pain, including Targin and Endone together, however have found an effective regime with Panadeine Forte and Naproxen. A list of all meds I take are:
Panadeine Forte (2 x 4-6 time a day)
Naproxen (1 tablet twice a day)
Esomeprazole (40mg x day)
Sertraline (200mg a day)
Endep (2 tablets at night)
Diazepam (5-10mg as needed)
Ural (urine alkaliser, two sachets I've a day when needed).
I have also had a spinal nerve injection (corticosteroid I think) at the L5-S1 level as a diagnostic tool for the neurosurgeon and spinal specialist team. It didn't help the pain at all, in fact it made it worse for 7/8 days, then my pain lowered to its usual level.

I think that's all of it. OKAY into the issue. 

I have what I can only describe as an irritable bladder - the feeling is the same as a UTI but without the other symptoms; there is no fever, no burning on urination. It just feels like a full bladder all the time. 

Ural, a urine alkaliser available over the counter, seems to help settle the feeling down, but otherwise it's 24h a day, and has been going on for about two months. It started before the nerve injection. I do recall noticing a slight improvement in the bladder issue after the injection for a day or two, then it returned.

The problem is, I have this stupid anxiety/fear about urine and stool sample tests. I did mention to my doctor a month or so ago and he gave me a dose of antibiotics which didn't seem to help. I know my doc will need a urine sample and is likely to ask me to do a 24h urine test... But even the thought of that is terrifying to me for some reason. It's irrational, I know. 

Is there anyone on here who can help me? I do see my Dr every fortnight (I'm in Australia) so I will mention it, but I just need to know if there's anything else I can try at home. I've tried increasing my water intake (2-4 700ml bottles a day) which hasn't helped.",1,2,2020-01-24,full term birth,484,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Pregnancy and fetal development risks relating to obesity vs overall age of prospective mother?,"I hope this is the right place for my question/quandary.

My wife (29f) and I (33m) are preparing to start reproducing in the very near future.  Like many persons in the developed world, we both spent a long time developing our personal and professional lives, at the sacrifice of intentionality delaying our plans to reproduce.  Like many in similar situations, she is now starting to feel ""under the gun"" to get the baby making done sooner than later.

I want to provide the best possible life my offspring, and we are prepared in many ways to enable this, however one lingering concern remains for me: my wife's current physical condition is not exactly what one would describe as ""fit"".  Reading scholarly articles [like this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983896/) has made me particularly concerned about the potential life long neurological and metabolic effects on a prospective child.

I am also aware of the widely known fetal development risks related to maternal age.  Therein is the quandary.  Do we push to make babes as soon as possible to preempt any age related difficulties, or do we focus on her fitness until she's no longer obese or overweight before conceiving?

I understand that this can be an especially sensitive topic for many, so I will reiterate for absolute clarity: my sole concern in this line of inquiry is to ensure the best possible long term health and quality of life outcome for any prospective future children.


**TL;DR**

33m and 29f planning for near future conception;  29f is currently overweight or obese, but urgently wants to ""beat the clock"" on age related pregnancy complications, while 33m is hesitant due to evidence-backed concerns about potential fetal development issues and lifelong negative health outcomes for offspring due to maternal obesity during gestation.

Other health issues: None, born 38 weeks through induction due to large size, diagnosed with large for gestational age and did have shoulder dystocia due to size

My child was diagnosed with Croup, almost 2 weeks ago. He had the classic croup cough, and I had laryngitis. Told by GP to just monitor him. He was given two doses of a steroid. During this course, his cough started to change and he started struggling to breathe and would vomit constantly due to the coughing. I brought him into the hospital as he was using his accessory muscles to breathe. Doctor told me in ER that he was using his accessory muscles but it was because his nose was congested, so recommended saline and nose frida. My husband and I did that, but our son continued to worsen with his cough. He would have huge coughing fits that would cause him to struggle to breathe. My last straw was when I was home with him and his lips started going blue because he was choking. I flipped him over on his stomach and started hitting his back and he puked up a lot of mucus. I rushed him to the hospital. They swabbed him for RSV, Influenza and Pertussis. Paediatrician started him on an antibiotic while we wait for the the pertussis results. He is admitted to hospital, with low fever, high heart rate and low sp02. He requires sp02 when sleeping but never when awake. We stay 3 days and then the last day he was napping on his own without requiring oxygen. My husband and I have an owlet that monitors heart rate and oxygen. We hadn't used it before but thought this would be good. The nurse told me if he fell lower than 90 to bring him in immediately as once they fall, they can really fall. No alarms go off in the night, baby is sleeping in our room. A few coughing fits but nothing bad. I look at the results over night. His average sp02 was 92. He was typically 91-97 for most of the night, but there was an hour over night he went from 86-89, then back up to 91. 

&#x200B;

Should I bring him back to the hospital, or take him to my GP? Or none of the above?

AskDocs,Pregnancy Anxiety," 

24 white female, 5'5"" & 150lb.  
Current medications: levothyroxine & propranolol, nexplanon contraceptive implant (inserted Jan 2018)

For context - I have some issues with anxiety, a lot revolving around illness and lateness, so if I think something is wrong with me or I'm waiting for something like test results (or my period...) I can become nervous and distracted, not usually to an extent that affects me physically.

Essentially my period is well over a month late, almost at the point where I have skipped the period and the next one should be due soon. I've been feeling gassy/nauseous at different times of day and nervous, and sometimes my boobs/nipples feel a little sore - obviously pregnancy could be the answer but I use a contraceptive implant and my partner and I also use condoms. I have taken four pregnancy tests from different brands, two this week and two last week - all negative - but nothing seems to make me feel better or reassure me I'm not pregnant. I know it's highly unlikely but every day my period doesn't show up I become more convinced. Could anyone give a second opinion on the symptoms and let me know if this is usual for people using implants? Is it possible? I know stress can impact the menstrual cycle and I am sometimes irregular but it's rare I skip altogether. I would appreciate any advice or feedback that might make me stop worrying a little.

This may get wordy... To begin, I have the Mirena and it has been in place for two years. On August 11th I had the sex. The following occurred: One week after sex- Started having dizzy spells. Felt gross. About week and a half after- Dizzy (fainting) got so bad I was sent to the ER. Diagnosed with vitamin deficiency (pregnancy test taken and was negative.) Soon after- Began spotting, spotting in a way I had only ever experienced one time before, when I was pregnant. But this was a bit different. It fit right between spotting and a light period. It was on and off for days. My gut told me to take a pregnancy test (about two weeks post sex). It was negative. I didn‚Äôt consider a pregnancy possible, not with an IUD, so I let the idea leave my mind. I was spotting for a few more days. This spotting was fairly heavy. My boobs were so sore. I threw up a couple times. I continued spotting lightly for over a week. I was extremely tired, would have waves of vertigo and hot flashes, and bouts of nausea. I began cramping (this is now about 5 weeks) and had really painful lower back pain. I (sorry ladies) don‚Äôt ever, ever have cramps. The back pain was a surprise as I hadn‚Äôt done anything to cause it. Then, diarrhea. Then, the most heavy period I have ever had. Extreme clots. This lasted five days, which is where I am now. I went to Planned Parenthood and I tested negative (urine test) for a pregnancy. The doctor said that because I have an IUD and I never had a positive pregnancy test, that it was unlikely this was a chemical pregnancy. She also said she wasn‚Äôt sure what was happening. She put me on a high dose of progesterone and told me to pay close attention to my flow and if it gets heavier I should go to the hospital. Guys, when I say heavy flow I mean heavy flow. Clots. I can literally push them out.

I want to add one more thing, you can dig it or not. I got pregnant and had a very healthy baby in 2016. About a week before I found out I was pregnant with my daughter I had very extreme emotions. Not just depression (which I have) but some serious anxiety and a desire to put myself in a secure and healthy environment, which I was in, but this was a desire to care for my body. The night before I took my positive pregnancy test I, who was a heavy drinker at the time (I‚Äôm 9 months sober now. Heyooo!) took a chug of Whiskey and I was absolutely disgusted. The next morning I took a pregnancy test. I had absolutely no reason to believe I was pregnant. It was just a weird gut feeling, and sure enough it was positive.

I have had this exact feeling for the last two weeks. I didn‚Äôt put two and two together until I started bleeding so heavily. I know this sounds silly, but I am very active in keeping mindful and working on my mental health, and when these feelings arose I felt very uncomfortable, unmanageable, and I packed a bag and went to my parents to ‚Äúget healthy.‚Äù

IgM P23 Ab: present
Cholesterol: 89 (low)
Creatinine: 1.12 (high)

The doctor has ordered me to come back in 3 weeks to do a repeat blood test for comparison. The only concern she had was my low WBC. She didn‚Äôt mention any of the other abnormal findings on the phone, I just saw them on the lab report and I guess according to the lab they were out of range.

AskDocs,Hemorrhoid? Episiotomy complication? Tender lymph nodes are worrying me!,"Hi all, 

29 female

live in the Southwest USA. 

Had a baby 18 months ago with pretty significant episiotomy (early labor was rapid due to a placental abruption). Stopped breastfeeding about 1 month ago. 

No meds currently aside from OTC allergy meds. 

History of IBS, but no symptoms since I got pregnant (it‚Äôs a miracle!) 

History of Bipolar type II. Currently very well controlled. 

Edit: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 130 lbs. I also have an IUD and have not had a true period since Sep 2017 when I got pregnant. 



Problem: so, a few days ago I developed a painful ‚Äúbump‚Äù in my perineum area. It‚Äôs almost more like a ‚Äúflap‚Äù of skin/tissue than a bump. It‚Äôs very painful and sensitive. It also is causing itching. 

No bleeding, and does not LOOK like images of hemorrhoids I see online. It‚Äôs more of an elongated ‚Äúflap‚Äù I guess and it extends from my anus towards my vagina. It does not reach all the way to the vaginal opening though. There do appear to be some smaller bulges around my actual anus, but not large and those don‚Äôt hurt. 

It‚Äôs also not red or purple like images of hemorrhoids online show. It‚Äôs just kind of flesh colored like all the other skin around it. But maybe a little red in an irritated or inflamed way. My husband has had an internal hemorrhoid since birth that sometimes bulges out and he looked at mine and said it looks totally different. (I‚Äôve never looked at his anus. Lol). 

In looking online, honestly the closest thing I could find that looks similar is ‚Äúperineal pyramidal protrusion‚Äù but everything I read says that occurs only in young children. That‚Äôs what it looks similar to, though. 

The most concerning thing to me is that I now also have really tender lymph nodes on both sides of my groin. The right one may be slightly swollen, but they‚Äôre both very tender. 

The right lymph node does occasionally swell randomly (maybe once a year for a few days) and I‚Äôve had it looked at via ultrasound in the past (maybe 6 years ago) and was told it was normal. Was told as long as it was just one side and not persistent it was ok. But now both sides are tender and it‚Äôs coinciding with the appearance of this super uncomfortable ... lump ... in my perineum. 

Could this be a hemorrhoid? Do hemorrhoids get infected (causing the lymph node symptoms)? 

Could it possibly be something related to my hx of episiotomy? It doesn‚Äôt extend all the way to my vagina, but it does KIND OF look like it could be scar tissue that‚Äôs really inflamed/swollen?? Is that even possible 18 months later? 

Google is scaring me with all the potential episiotomy complications! 

Treatment: so far I‚Äôve been applying hemorrhoid cream for a few days and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping. It seems to be getting worse. Definitely more painful. Today I added in Gold Bond on top of the cream to help with some of the pain. 

I can‚Äôt get into my PCP until next Tuesday so I‚Äôm trying to tough it out but just want to make sure I‚Äôm not ignoring something that may be more serious?

Edit: I also have none of the risk factors for hemorrhoid I don‚Äôt think. Have not strained to have a bowel movement, no excessive diarrhea,  no pregnancy or obesity, no anal sex.  We did have regular vaginal sex the evening prior to this showing up, but it wasn‚Äôt anything crazy. I‚Äôve had some vagina pain with sex since giving birth, but this time it was not out of the ordinary.",1,5,2019-11-13,early labor,609,,,,,,,,,

I have a surgery scheduled this week to fix the hernia (laparoscopic). My concern is I have white coat hypertension (it is high at the beginning of appointments and drops to either normal or prehypertensive ranges by the end of my doctor visits). I'm assuming this means I experience periodic blood pressure spikes when I'm anxious/stressed. 

My surgeon is aware and he performed my appendectomy a few years ago. During presurgical testing this week, the PA said this would preclude me from having surgery if I am not relaxed enough the day of surgery (""They won't let you have the surgery if your numbers are like this""). When the ECG reading came out, she said it ""looked good""  so this wasn't a concern for me until I just read the results. All other presurgical testing was normal (blood counts, metabolic counts, etc.). My ECG has the following reading. When I see my GP's office, what are the chances they won't medically clear me?

AskDocs,Muscle weakness and stiffness; physio or personal trainer?,"Female, caucasian, 5'8"", 145 lbs, 49 years

I have lingering weakness possibly from being in the ICU 5 years ago, what should I do?

Before the ICU stay, I was finding it difficult to stand for a long time, I guess starting when I was 42-43ish. If I did, I found that I got stiff. Often, I would wake up in the morning, stiff. So I started doing stretches at work when I had a bit of a break, because I sit a lot at work.

So I had a baby 5 years ago, I had acute fatty liver of pregnancy, so I had liver failure causing them to deliver him at 36 weeks. After a rough first day in the NICU he is doing great. I had a lot of blood loss and they debated doing a liver transplant. I was in ICU for 3 days and another 10 days in the maternity unit while they waited for my liver to go to an acceptable level.

So from when I recovered, and was back at home, I found that it was difficult for me to go from sitting on the floor, to standing up.

I got a frozen shoulder when my baby was an infant, and did a lot of physio for that and it's okay now. I still do my arm physio exercises most days, and I also do ballet-style stretches with my legs. I asked my physio person about my back stiffness and those exercises I do not do regularly - lie on my back, bend my knees and tilt my legs to one side then the other. I get about 6000 steps in, in an average day, of getting to and from work and walking on my break.

Five years on, I still find it difficult to go from sitting on the floor to standing. I find it difficult to lean forward washing dishes at the sink, doing other things that involve bending to pick things off the floor etc. These things make me tired and achy. I was trying to listen to my body and rest and wait and kind of make my energy last longer. However I am really frustrated because I can't get my stuff done this way. I am not THAT old yet.

My doctor tested me for rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. But now she is suggesting that I take an SSRI. I disagree with this. I am depressed to a certain degree but I am able to manage my depression after all these years. I think I need a way to get stronger, or rule out other medical conditions. She thinks I need to do aerobic exercise. She is probably right but I have no energy to do this. I have a low thyroid and she does not want to discuss adjusting my medication for that, she won't tell me my levels when I ask. I don't know if that is pertinent. She tests my liver levels every year or so but I don't know what they are.

I think I need either a personal trainer, or a physiotherapist, to help me get stronger, but I don't know which one.

I need more detailed instruction than ""get aerobic exercise"" I know nothing about working out. Maybe I need to eat more protein. I don't want to hurt myself if I pick the wrong physical exercise professional. If I get a personal trainer, will they know if they are in over their head with me? What do you think?

The dog snuck up on me completely unprovoked & aggressive. There were 5 other dogs on the property (all Springer Spaniels) & they kept their cool. The punctures are about 1/4 inches deep & I saw a medical professional yesterday who wants me on antibiotics so an infection doesn't pop up. The police officer I was in contact with regarding the incident has confirmed that the dog has never been vaccinated. They live on a farm so it is possible for the dog to be scratched or bitten from a wild animal & is in the beginning stages of rabies. The officer also will not get back to me about if the dog is being quarantined or not. I'm in a situation where I have to decide if cautious is the right answer (I think it is) & if I'm being overly dramatic. This is all coming out of pocket for the expense so it would be about $3,000 for the full dosage. 

Should I get the vaccine? Is it too late for me to receive the proper treatment? What should I do? I'm terrified.

AskDocs,"Multiple Rheumatologist visits, maybe it is all in my head. Just need to know if bloodwork may point to some validation??","Okay, I'll try not to make this super long while trying to include relevant information. I've been dealing with a handful of symptoms, off and on, for a couple of years now. I am 31F, white, 5'8 140 lbs, mom x 4. No meds, couple drinks every other weekend, no smoking/drugs. Decent exercise.



January of 2018, I went to my family doctor for first time in 6 years. Mostly for joint pain and stiffness in my hands, knees, feet - ongoing 2.5 months. Hands were worst-felt like a rubberband holding fingers tight. Also complained of always being tired and bad headaches daily. Dr. said to exercise more and I was tired because I had 4 young kids. Ran blood work and calls me and says ""Your blood work is in, it looks like you have lupus. I'm sending you to a rheumatologist."" Positive ANA and positive for Anti-DNA (DS) AB QN @ 13 (reference range was 0-9). RNP antibodies was .9 with reference range of 0-0.9.



Symptoms that MAY be of note: headaches (pain stems from my jaw and wraps around the back of my head), always 2/day. Horrible hip and back pain (assumed this was just my life now after 2 babies back to back). One hip tends to get kind of stuck with certain movements, and I have to work it back in place slowly. A couple of my ribs move out of place (a low one on each side) when I bend certain ways (super painful, but I can push them back in and they will just be a little tender for a bit after) - only maybe once a month. Pain in my fingers, wrists, feet, knees, shoulders (mostly dull ache or stiffness, nothing I can't live with).



Random other things of note: a couple of small spots inside my nose that will not heal up and go away. They scab over, eventually the scab will break free when I blow my always semi-runny/stuffy nose, and then they are just a sore again. My rheumatologist said I probably have Hidradenitis Suppurativa, due to two boils on my butt that never completely heal (and 2 smaller ones on panty line). Horrible face acne for the past few years. My husband thinks the redness on my face looks like the butterfly rash (only red sometimes, not usually bothersome). A different rash that would come and go but I never thought much of it. Anxiety/depression have been a battle off and on for years, but I had been pretty good on that front for years until all of this kind of brought it back.



Saw rheumatologist and that appointment was kind of humiliating. Most symptoms had settled down significantly since appt with family doc. I felt like a fool. He didn't read my list of symptoms (and disregarded many that I told him), but prescribed meloxicam 10mg and ordered blood work. Told me right off that my family doc shouldn't have said lupus, because it was probably false positives. This was March 2018. 

His blood work came back, ANA negative - titer <1:40. RNP antibody negative, >20 EIA value. Only positive was HISTONE ANTIBODIES @ 3 EIA value (>1.5 is strong positive). That and signs of a UTI. He didn't answer when I asked about the Histone antibodies (I hadn't been on medication to indicate drug induced lupus). He said I could have an autoimmune disease, but we may very well never know what. But definitely didn't look like lupus.



Next winter, I had been dealing with a rash. It was sporadic and only came on at night (except for like 3 times), multiple nights a week. It was deep red, clear lines, and after it came on it didn't spread. It didn't itch, but I would have labored breathing every time (just like I couldn't catch my breath). Rash would last about 2 hours and be gone. Changed everything we could think of in case of an allergic reaction. No change. This went on for about 3 months while some of the joint pain and stiffness returned. 



Went to see a rheumatologist/allergist in Jan 2019 to try to sort out the rash. She was pretty sure it was the wine I drank a couple nights a week. But it wasn't only when I drank wine. And it wouldn't always happen then. She didn't think it was anything else. But she did order an AVISE CTD test through exagen labs. 



ANA IgG Positive @ 35 units (reference range on testing says ELISA 20-59 - Positive). The Titer was left blank. No nuclear pattern and no cytoplasmic pattern observed.

Anti - carbamylated Protein IgG Positive @ 35 units (reference range says ELISA >20 - Positive). Everything else negative except for UTI-looking #s in urine again. I've had UTI half my life, usually not bothered.

Metabolic panels, CBC, etc all within normal ranges. Hand X-Rays showed no signs of significant abnormalities. 



Lost my insurance in early 2019. Just got on government insurance. Hands are getting very painful and stiff again. Pain in first knuckle of big toe often again. Fatigue is constant again. Rashes barely coming up any more. But my damn hands hurt!! I just want to know if it is worth going back to the rheumatologist based on my blood work or if I am a hypochondriac. If I am a hypochondriac, I can accept that and deal with it and live through the aches. No big deal, I've done it for years. But if my blood work looks like there could be a real problem with me, I want to see another dr so that I can be a better mom and wife. The rheumatologists I've seen didn't seem concerned with my blood work, but my anxiety is telling me to point it out to someone!

AskDocs,Cipralex while pregnant,"I have been on Cipralex (Escitalopram) for about ten years. I was always on 15mg. When I turned 26 I got pregnant and went down to 10mg the whole pregnancy.

AskDocs,Please help! Month-long nausea is impacting my daily living :(,"Me: 27F, 5'0, 185lbs, no history of significant medical issues. No recent falls or head trauma. Currently on Junel for birth control and Zofran for the nausea that has surfaced 

Since Christmas, I've had a host of weird symptoms. Nausea, some confusion, becoming overheated easily, excessive fatigue, and some constipation issues. When the nausea surfaces, I have this weird back of head pain that permeates down into my neck and upper back. It's not a headache but more feels like I've pulled a muscle. It's dull and more annoying than being actually painful. It usually happens in the mornings. No, I'm not pregnant (doctor tested me twice and I tested myself once üòÖ)

On Christmas, the symptoms were really bad to where I didn't eat at all and did a lot of dry heaving into the toilet. I slept a lot too that day. I got a little better the next couple of days to where I could eat but then that following Sunday night after Christmas, I was vomiting and had diarrhea. Same weird head pain too. I only vomited twice but had the chills and a fever of 100.8 at my highest. The duration of symptoms lasted 48 hours. My husband, two days later, then exhibited similar symptoms (chills, fever, vomiting and diarrhea) and we both chalked it up to bring the stomach flu. My husband recovered completely within 36 hours. I got better too, but my nausea, weird head pain, becoming overheated and some constipation persisted to some degree so I saw my PCP at the end of that week (Jan 9 actually). Blood work showed markers for possibly an acute viral infection and my doctor advised me that if symptoms persisted, I head to the ER. That weekend, I felt better than I had since before Christmas so I didn't go to the ER. However, that following Tuesday (Jan 14), my symptoms of nausea and head pain (decreased but still present) returned and then subsided by the end of the day so I didn't call my doctor or go to the ER. I felt good the rest of the week until the following Tuesday (Jan 21), where I felt the same symptoms again, albeit the head pain even less so this time. I did call my doctor this time and she advised that I go to an urgent care. At the urgent care facility, I got checked for the third time for pregnancy (since I didn't have my period, which should have happened the week prior; negative again). My urine test though showed signs of a UTI, which I'm currently being treated for with antibiotics.

I'm currently experiencing nausea again, the first time since 1/21, but this time theres no weird head pain. Could a UTI have really caused my month-long weird symptoms? Anything else it might be? I didn't have my usual symptoms of UTI which, before when I had them and it's been awhile, I would only get the urgency to pee a lot. I'm really hoping that the UTI was the culprit all along and that my symptoms don't resurface. Also, I'm thinking that having the stomach flu in the midst of this weird illness was just a coincidence (my mom said she had it before me, so I probably just caught it from her)

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated :)",1,1,2020-01-25,pregnancy trauma,559,,,,,,,,,
AskDocs,Seemingly undiagnosable itch,"Hello! I have a medical mystery apparently. Female, 27, T2DM, HPB, hypothyroidism. Non smoking. No history of pregnancy, STDs, currently only intermittently active with 1 partner since last April. Infection started last February after sleeping with a new partner. This was during a period of high stress. 

Lots of family history of cancer and heart disease, no sign of these yet in me.

I take the following meds:
Metformin 500mg BID
Levothyroxine 50mcg
Lisinopril 10mh
Jardiance 50mg
Paragard 



For a YEAR now, after having unprotected sex with a new partner a single time, I have had extreme discomfort vaginally. My general physician tested for all STDs, all were negative. 

Swabbed, said it was a yeast infection. Never had one in my life. Diaflucan. Never touched it. It went up in ever increasing amounts. For days, weeks, even months. No effect. 

Saw a gynocologist. She did a swab. Said it was urea plasma, yeast and BV. Did clindomyocin, diaflucan and metrinziadole gel. No change. 

Went back. Did the swab. Same results. Now I have diaflucan, ciprofloxacin cream, moxifloxacin. Been on those for 14 days. No change. I went to clean up, like I do daily, and today there appears to be a raw looking sore on the left side of my vulva that is slick, wet and shiny in a place that normally isn't, and it had a yeasty overgrowth on top. I have been absolutely miserable for a YEAR. 

Please, any suggestions would help. I just want to stop feeling like garbage all the time, and all that seems like is happening is that it's getting worse, and it's wrecking my life and relationships.

AskDocs,Chemical Pregnancy with an IUD?,"Basic info- 33, female, had one healthy pregnancy with vaginal delivery. 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 113 lbs.
Medications are Lexapro and Wellbutrin.
Don‚Äôt drink, don‚Äôt smoke. 

This may get wordy... To begin, I have the Mirena and it has been in place for two years. On August 11th I had the sex. The following occurred: One week after sex- Started having dizzy spells. Felt gross. About week and a half after- Dizzy (fainting) got so bad I was sent to the ER. Diagnosed with vitamin deficiency (pregnancy test taken and was negative.) Soon after- Began spotting, spotting in a way I had only ever experienced one time before, when I was pregnant. But this was a bit different. It fit right between spotting and a light period. It was on and off for days. My gut told me to take a pregnancy test (about two weeks post sex). It was negative. I didn‚Äôt consider a pregnancy possible, not with an IUD, so I let the idea leave my mind. I was spotting for a few more days. This spotting was fairly heavy. My boobs were so sore. I threw up a couple times. I continued spotting lightly for over a week. I was extremely tired, would have waves of vertigo and hot flashes, and bouts of nausea. I began cramping (this is now about 5 weeks) and had really painful lower back pain. I (sorry ladies) don‚Äôt ever, ever have cramps. The back pain was a surprise as I hadn‚Äôt done anything to cause it. Then, diarrhea. Then, the most heavy period I have ever had. Extreme clots. This lasted five days, which is where I am now. I went to Planned Parenthood and I tested negative (urine test) for a pregnancy. The doctor said that because I have an IUD and I never had a positive pregnancy test, that it was unlikely this was a chemical pregnancy. She also said she wasn‚Äôt sure what was happening. She put me on a high dose of progesterone and told me to pay close attention to my flow and if it gets heavier I should go to the hospital. Guys, when I say heavy flow I mean heavy flow. Clots. I can literally push them out.

I want to add one more thing, you can dig it or not. I got pregnant and had a very healthy baby in 2016. About a week before I found out I was pregnant with my daughter I had very extreme emotions. Not just depression (which I have) but some serious anxiety and a desire to put myself in a secure and healthy environment, which I was in, but this was a desire to care for my body. The night before I took my positive pregnancy test I, who was a heavy drinker at the time (I‚Äôm 9 months sober now. Heyooo!) took a chug of Whiskey and I was absolutely disgusted. The next morning I took a pregnancy test. I had absolutely no reason to believe I was pregnant. It was just a weird gut feeling, and sure enough it was positive.

I have had this exact feeling for the last two weeks. I didn‚Äôt put two and two together until I started bleeding so heavily. I know this sounds silly, but I am very active in keeping mindful and working on my mental health, and when these feelings arose I felt very uncomfortable, unmanageable, and I packed a bag and went to my parents to ‚Äúget healthy.‚Äù

Could this have been a chemical pregnancy? Could I have taken the first pregnancy test too early to detect HCG and the last one too late to detect HCG?

BabyBumps,"New, Anxious","Hello, I'm brand new here!

I will be introducing myself properly in the intro sticky thread, but... I really wanted to make a post, because I need a little help? Encouragement? Reassurance? Something, haha.

I just found out I am pregnant... yesterday. Solid positive test. I know, it's pretty early in the whole process! An app I had reccommended to me says I'm pretty much 2 weeks pregnant now. Yay?

So, here's the thing: I never thought I would have children. I was never one of those people who would squeal and coo at people's babies- in fact, I would turn away, disgusted and uncomfortable. It got a little better with time... but even in my last relationship, it just felt like something that I simply would never do.

In my current relationship... I knew from the get-go that my husband values having a family. He even broke up with his last girlfriend because she said she wouldn't ""have time"" to have kids (there was, of course, more to it than that, but it was a big catalyst). I came into the relationship knowing this (he and I have been friends for... 13 years now?), and I was, by then, somewhat open to the idea.

Fast forward to now... we've been sorta trying since December. I was even the one who said ""We should start now, because we're never going to have a better time.""

I have an anxiety disorder, as well as PTSD, Depression, and ADHD. It's an interesting mix. But, the hardest part for me right now is the fear: I'm terrified. I have moments right now where it really \*sinks in\* and for a brief moment, I feel excited... and then terrified. Terrified. And then it goes away, because I return to denial. It's easier there.

There are so many things about this process- mostly, about the medical system around the process -that I am scared of. I feel completely unprepared. I can't even say it out loud, ""I'm pregnant."" I've put myself in to get a Midwife, because it's very difficult to get one where I live, and the usual rhetoric is to get on it as SOON as you know. I would probably have done it yesterday if they were open. I'll find out soonish if I can get one. 

Err, so... any advice? Has anyone else struggled with this kind of fear early on?

AskDocs,I'm 23F and worried due to delayed periods," 

I met my BF in March 1st week and we had unprotected sex several times then. He never came near or in me during that time. Still as a protective measure I took 2 contraceptive pills during that week. I got early periods during second week of March. But I haven't gotten my next periods yet.

We've been under lockdown since then due to COVID. Now my periods are getting delayed. I'm worried sick because of this. Last week, I was also diagnosed with a UTI and started taking medication for it.

What is the chance that my delayed periods are due to pregnancy? Or is it due to stress/UTI?

Please help!

I know this may sound ridiculous but hear me out. 

So I have a cat that ran out and came back with a strange scab. I couldn't determine if it's an allergic reaction or an animal bite. A trip to the vet later in the week has been set. I must also note that his one year rabies vaccine is overdue by 2 months.

Anyways the other day he decided to grab my leg and bit me. He likes to do this sometimes playfully so it wasn't out of the ordinary. I examined the bite and it did break skin and bled a little.

This is where my fear kicks in. I am now worried that I might get rabies because he might have been bitten by an animal outside and then bit me. Will I get rabies? The cat isn't showing symptoms and is acting perfectly normal but I can't seem to shake it off.

Idk if this will help, but me and my sister were born around a month early due to my mother having HELLPs syndrome. 

One morning I woke up sore, like I slept wrong or something. I went on about my day. I went to bed again, and woke up a little better, with not much  pain. 

Well, I went to volunteer and help set up an Easter Egg Hunt. I was doing fine, spreading eggs around, bending up and down to do so. Now, it wasn't like I was doing hard labor, I was just bending down and spreading eggs out on a flat surface for toddlers to find, not bad. 

Well, eventually the event started, so I was walking around, looking at a snake from the petting zoo, when my dad tried to scare me. You know when people poke you in the ribs and it just feels weird, and startles you? Well, it wasn't one of those times, because all of a sudden my back seized up and was in glorious amounts of pain. Like a lightning bolt smiting my back. Taking a step was like a knife stabbing it, it was awful. 

After an hour or so coping with the pain, we decided it was best to get home. 

We decided to go in and then it was decided that I should get an Xray, since it felt painful when they put their hands where it might have been a break. The doctors and my mother think it was all muscle, and the xrays came up with nothing.

I had to ride home on the bus from school 2 days after, which was really painful as every bump felt like my back was crunching in on itself. I kept myself in a position where my arms held myself up to act as a shock absorber or something. 

The pain lasted a couple more days, gradually getting better.

After 8 months of being told I could have a VBAC I was informed that my baby was measuring more than 10 lbs and that their professional advice would be to go with a cesarean so to avoid baby getting stuck in the birth canal.
