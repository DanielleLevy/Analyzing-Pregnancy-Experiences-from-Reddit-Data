BabyBumps,A normal symptom of pregnancy or an emergency you need to go to the hospital for? Lol who knows?!: A story of the 3rd trimester,"Seriously, you guys... This is ridiculous.

Is it just me or is everything you experience, especially in the third trimester, a normal symptom and also a huge deal simultaneously?

Puffy hands and feet? Well that's totally normal, especially if you've had some salt or been on your feet a lot. Or iT CoULd bE PrE-EcLAmPsIa!!!

Headache? It's because of the extra weight, off-center balance, stress, and bad posture... *Or your blood pressure could be so high that your eyeballs are going to pop out of your skull!!!!*

Abdominal pain? It's just your round ligaments, gas, acid reflux, Braxton Hicks, or stretching skin. OR YOU MIGHT LITERALLY BE DYING!!!! OR IN LABOR!!!

Back pain? psshhh that's totally normal! Unless it radiates to your thighs, which could also be totally normal, *OR you could be going into pre-term labor!!!*

AskDocs,Help me identify my condition.," 16M, 50 kg, 160 cm. 
I live in the Philippines . I have this condition that my legs and hips are uneven. And also it my knee caps are something locked, that's why I can't stand straight and walk properly. Also, I was born premature. I never went to doctor or seek for medical attention because my family don't have enough money. Despite of my condition, I am an honor student of a public high school. When we have our Physical Education class, I never experience to participate and join thembut instead, I just stare at them and feel insecure.On the other hand, I am grateful that I am here, given a chance to live.

These are some photos of my condition:

NICUParents,Coming home after 6 month NICU stay. Advice?,Our son Cayden was born the begging of October at 28 weeks. He got NEC at 2 weeks old and had surgery to removed 1/3 of his small intestine. He’s since had three more reoccurrences  of NEC which his team of doctors say they have not even heard of before so he has been watched closely for good reason. He’s needed three more abdominal surgeries to fix strictures and other things related to NEC. The neo team told us to expect him home in the next two weeks. He will be coming home on TPN and his gtube on continuous. Does anyone have any advice on making the transition ?

BabyBumps,Preterm Labor,I am 35 weeks today and went into labor last Wednesday. They were able to shut it down and I’ve been at home on bedrest since leaving the hospital. I feel terrible and the nifedipine (contraction stopping medicine) wears off quicker every day and the contractions get worse. Back labor was terrible again just last night. I can’t imagine feeling this terrible for another week or two. I can only walk at a 90 degree angle because the pain is so bad. The doctor just wants me to hang in til 37 weeks for an induction. Send your happy thoughts my way because this is really getting to be unbearable.,27,9,2020-03-02,preterm labor,110,PRE,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,I know this might be a long shot but any mommas out there who were on mental health medications during pregnancy?,My husband and I are a month away from trying to start our family. I live in Chicago and am fortunate enough to have my psychiatrist and gyno at the same amazing hospital. I am bipolar and my doctors agreed the benefits of me remaining on my meds during pregnancy outweigh any risk to the baby. (I am on 100 mg of seroquel). I’m terrified but I know that I will slip into horrible mania or depression without my meds. I don’t know if I’m making the right decision but I so desperately want to be a mom. Anyone have their own experience they would care to share that’s similar to mine?,25,33,2019-11-15,mental health during pregnancy,112,PRE,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,What do early labor contractions feel like?,"I'm 39+4 weeks and a first time mom. My doctor told me 3 days ago that I could go into labor any day now. I'm really nervous I won't be able to tell early labor contractions from Braxton Hicks contractions. I keep feeling achy, menstrual-like cramps in my lower back that are irregular. And at night I get really tight in my abdomen/uterus for prolonged periods. I keep reading wildly different reports on what they should feel like. 

I'm probably just really anxious about the whole thing and it's probably a stupid question, but what did early labor feel like for you?",22,18,2020-03-21,early labor,102,PRE,,,,,,,,,
BabyBumps,"Baby is here. Full house of labour experiences: 4 days early labour, water break no contractions, back labour, natural labour, epidural, failed epidural, vacuum delivery, emergency section. (TW maybe, overall positive).","I had my son on Friday 6th Dec. 

Fairly traumatic back labour (no time between contractions, most with double peaks) with a half failed epidural at 7cm (didnt stop any back pains)  and an emergency section (baby in distress after being vacuumed to change position), all 40 hours after my water broke and with an induction half way through. 

Very relieved when the c section was performed and baby arrived husband had a very traumatic time and I definitely credit my ability to cope during and after to the hypnobirthing knowledge I had researched. 

Been through the wringer but so happy.

Had three tough days with baby bringing in my milk but today we went home and it's been the most beautiful week of my life.

BabyBumps,If you’ve had BOTH a c-section AND a vaginal delivery:,"Which did you prefer and why? 

I never wanted kids of my own because I’m terrified to give birth, and after my IUD went missing I decided to keep the baby and go ahead with everything. But I really don’t want to give birth vaginally. I trust medicine and surgeons and think I would prefer a c-section for a number of reasons. My MD suggested I ask people who have done it both ways and ask what the preference was, in terms of recovery or anything else that comes to mind.

Update: to be very clear I’m asking for points of view ONLY from people who have had BOTH a csection and a vaginal delivery. If you had one and enjoyed it then that’s great but that’s not what I’m asking for. Thank you",17,28,2020-03-30,c-section delivery,134,PRE,,,,,,,,,
NICUParents,When did you leave the NICU?,"hey mommies and daddies! we had a little surprise when our rainbow baby came early at about 32 weeks. despite an agonizing week of on and off labor, she defied the odds and was born safely this morning at 4 lbs. 6 oz. able to breathe on her own, able to hold her blood sugars, and doing great with her body temperature. until my milk comes in we are pumping the little colostrum I have and combining it with donor milk as well as some IV nutrition. I have been breast-feeding every 2-3 hours and I hope my milk will come in in the next day or two.

I am in shock. Ran to fertility clinic and beta is 450.

Haven’t even told my husband yet.

AskDocs,"Wife has gotten 4 cm taller, well past the age that people normally stop growing?","Background.

Wife is late bloomer, she went from the shortest in the class to on the taller side.

Was 167 cm several years ago before we got married.

We had a couple of kids early 20s. She gained some weight during pregnancy.

Now she does exercises, a rowing machine and exercise bikes mostly.

Her height is now 171 cm.

&#x200B;

Its not a measurement error. She measured 5'6"" or 167 cm several times, they have used a stadiometer.

Now she is 171.

&#x200B;

We also notice her height change as she is taller relative to me than she used to be. Memory and photos.

&#x200B;

What could possibly explain that?

I read about people with gland disorders and things and it makes me worried for her.

&#x200B;

Now real other symptoms that I can think of.

So I asked her if she's hoping I give birth early, and she said, ""no, I hope you have a healthy pregnancy, but wouldn't it be so cute to have a tiny baby?""

AskDocs,6 months pregnant had an extreme fight with spouse,"-6 months pregnant
-living in Cali 
-160 pounds

Hello, I had an extreme fight with my spouse this morning. I ended up screaming top of my lungs and hyperventilating. I knew I had to remove myself from the situation so I left. The duration of me freaking out was probably 20 minutes. 

To explain why the fight happened is a long story but my spouse has become verbally abusive during my pregnancy. I know I have to address it. 

Will this cause a miscarriage or harm my baby? I can feel baby moving here and there after I removed myself from the situation. I am really scared I harmed my baby.
