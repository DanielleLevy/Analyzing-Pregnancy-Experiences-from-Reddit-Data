BabyBumps,The 20 anatomy week scan: What sonographers are looking at,"Hi everyone! As a Sonographer, I thought you guys might be interested in learning about what we have to know/look at for the 20-week anatomy scans. This is a medical procedure, and we are looking at many potential problems that can occur during a baby's growth. It can be a pretty stressful exam for a sonographer. This is sometimes the only exam where baby is really checked over, and they want to be careful to not miss anything and stay on schedule for their other patients, while also trying to be professional and kind to the mamas. It can be a hard balance, but we try and do our best.

This might be a little long, but I'll try and break it up.

If you have any other questions about procedure and what's going on behind the scenes, you could ask in r/ultrasound. While we don't do diagnoses there, or interpret images, we are happy to help people understand what is going on during the ultrasound, why we do/don't do certain things and what the machine is capable of!

I'm hoping that this information is informative and interesting, and doesn't cause anyone additional stress. I hope that you walk away from reading this realizing the depth of our checks on the baby at the 20 week scan and take that positively, not worrying about every possible thing that could possibly go wrong.

&#x200B;

Step 1: Count the babies, count the placentas, find fetal heart activity. We first need to know what we are working with, so we start with a broad overall view. After figuring out all the we have to deal with, we then make sure that the baby or babies have heart movement, because if we can't find that, the exam and day is going to change for the worse. Everyone comes in excited for a gender reveal and assuming their baby is healthy, but unfortunately that is not always the case. :(

Step 2: It's not just about the baby. After checking out the baby and placenta, we look at the woman's cervix and uterus, to make sure there are no problems there - related to or unrelated to the pregnancy.

Step 3: Back to the baby. We measure the amount of amniotic fluid, making sure there is not too much or two little. They can mean different things to a pregnancy, and can let us know if there might be any problems or potential problems to be monitored for (diabetes, preeclampsia, or just simple dehydration).

Step 4: Assuming from now on there is baby with a healthy heartbeat found, our next steps are to make sure that the organs are on the right sides of the body and figure out how the baby is laying within the mother. We check that the heart and stomach are on the left sides of the body, and use that information to know what way the baby is facing as they inevitably flip around during the exam.

Step 5: The actual fetal anatomy survey. I'm not going to put this in order, because we can't always do it in a specific order. We try to do it in ""chapters"", and keep related images together. Order depends on the position of the baby. There are so many things to check, and sometimes the baby is not in a good position to see some things accurately. So, we take them in the order that the baby allows, and hope that they don't turn over too fast, or that they do turn over after we finish one side, haha.

BRAIN: Since the baby's skull isn't bone yet, but cartilage, we can see through it. Our goal is to find certain brain structures. Since the baby's skull forms/grows from the outside towards the center, if we can find certain structures near the center/midline of the brain, it means that everything until that point has grown correctly. If you're building something and mess up step 1, the rest of the steps are going to get messed up too. By proving that different central brain structures are the right size, shape, and in the right place, we prove that the baby's brain is correctly formed. There are 6 brain structures that we have to locate and image, and a few of those we have to measure. At this time, we also measure the head circumference and diameter, to make sure that the baby is at the right size for its age. Lastly, we look at the brain's blood supply, and make sure that it is getting all it needs.

This is also where we can, if we are in the right spot, take a measurement of a nuchal fold. If the nuchal fold measurement is too large, it means that there is an increased risk of a genetic trisomy disorder. Which means any of the disorders related to having 3 of a chromosome instead of two. (Trisomy 13, Trisomy 18, or Trisomy 21/Down's Syndrome)

FACE: We look for a profile shot (this is often one of the ones you take home), to look at the nasal bone, lips, and chin. We also look at the lips and nose from a second, straight on angle, that lets us see the contours better. We want to find a nasal bone, because if it is absent, it is associated with some of those Trisomy conditions and means that there is a higher risk that the baby has one of them. We look at the lips to make sure that there is not a cleft lip. If we know about a cleft lip ahead of time, it can be easier on the parents and hospital staff to fix it as soon as possible after birth. We can also see the lenses in the eyes, which means the baby does not have cataracts.

\[I'm going to say a little something about what we call ""soft markers"" here. Some of these things such as the nasal bone being absent, or the nuchal fold being a little large, are called SOFT MARKERS. There are quite a few of them, and they happen in completely normal babies. We call them soft markers because if there is just one of them, we are not at all worried about the baby having a problem. When they show up in multiples however, we recommend further testing because there is an increased risk of some disorders. But having just one of them is a normal variation.\]

SPINE: The baby needs to be back facing up for this one, and we look at the whole spine from the neck to the tailbone. We have to make sure that each vertebra has 3 points, and that the skin is covering the entire back over the spine. We're looking for spina bifida here, a failure of the spinal cord to be enclosed.

ABDOMEN: We look at the lungs, heart, kidney, stomach, and bladder. When we can see the stomach and where the umbilical cord comes in, we know that we are at the right spot to measure the abdomen. This measurement helps us guess at the baby's weight.

LUNGS: Are they there? Are there any masses or fluid pushing on the lungs?

HEART: The position and axis that it is on. It should be about mid-chest, but pointing to the left. We need to check that all 4 chambers are there, and that there are barriers between them and valves opening and closing as the blood moves. We look at the different ways that everything connects to the heart, and make sure everything is in the right place and connected correctly - no holes anywhere.

KIDNEYS: We make sure they are the correct size and in the correct places. We check to make sure that urine is draining properly, sometimes it can get a little ""backed up"" and the kidneys will be dilated.

STOMACH: We just need to see that it is on the left side.

BLADDER: While the baby is inside you, its urinary system is working and practicing. The baby swallows amniotic fluid, which we can see in the stomach. Then, if everything is connected correctly and working, we can see the bladder fill up, then empty. All this happens at least 1 time per hour, so we need to be able to see it to confirm that everything is working correctly. So during the 1 hour scan time, we need to be able to see the bladder full at one point, and the bladder empty. They don't have to be in that order, though. Often we will check at the very beginning if the bladder is full or empty. If it started out full, and when we look later it is empty, we know that it is working. If it was empty, and now it is full, we can assume that it is working properly as well.

LIMBS: You would think this would be easy, but when the baby is flailing around in there, sometimes a sonographer realizes that they just measured the same arm twice and have to redo it. As part of our measurements for size, we measure the length of the femur (thigh bone), which also helps for weight calculations. Other than that, we are just taking pictures looking for presence/absence of all the limbs and bones. start at a shoulder, take the upper arm image, follow it down, forearm, and then get a hand with all the fingers. Repeat other side, then repeat with legs.

And that's the full medical anatomy scan of the baby.

Step 6: Placenta and umbilical cord - make sure that it has all of the arteries and vein it needs (2 arteries, 1 vein), and make sure the placenta looks healthy and isn't too close to the cervix. When I was learning this, I wasn't surprised to hear that we had to check and make sure the umbilical cord wasn't wrapped around the babies neck, with so much moving around. I was surprised, though, to hear that we only get worried if it is wrapped around the neck 2 or more times. apparently, once is normal and perfectly fine, they'll probably flip it off with all the moving about in no time.

Step 7: The part everyone was waiting for. Check out those fun bits, and find out if you're going to have a boy or a girl. Hopefully they're not crossing their legs and shy. :)

&#x200B;

After the anatomy scan, some places offer a trans vaginal ""cervical length screening"" to see if you are at-risk for preterm delivery. If you've had a preterm delivery before, they usually recommend you get it. If you don't have any risk factors, they don't often press if you're not interested. For the screening, they have you take your pants/underwear off, feet in the stirrups, and insert the transvaginal probe. Then they take measurements of your cervix length, and then a few videos of what the cervix looks like when there is pressure being put on your abdomen, like there would be when you have contractions. For this, we press firmly on your lower abdomen while taking a clip of the cervix. If it opens up at all, that could be a cause for concern to be discussed with your doctor.

A transvaginal exam can also be useful if your placenta is particularly low-lying. Then the tech can see exactly how close it is to the cervix, or if it is covering the cervix at all. Sometimes it can be difficult to see, especially if baby's head is low.

&#x200B;

I hope that didn't scare anyone, and I hope it was interesting to you guys.

Have a happy, healthy pregnancy!!

EDIT: 9/30/21 - I added some additional details that I may have left out, and tried to clarify a bit better.

BabyBumps,"Apparently I'm being ""unreasonable"" by refusing to hang out with unvaxxed friends","I'm currently 31w pregnant and also have a 21 month old at home.  Both hubby and I are vaccinated.  We have friends who used to live nearby but have moved out of state who are coming cross country to visit and I just found out neither of them are vaccinated.  Freaking wonderful.  According to them, since we're vaccinated, ""we'll be fine.""  Except that our toddler isn't vaccinated and the Delta variant of covid is aggressive enough to infect vaccinated people regardless.  On top of that, they'll be on a plane to get here, so who knows what they might pick up during that flight.  \*AND\* they've already got their entire week booked out here meeting with all their old friends.  It's too late for them to get vaccinated before they leave, even if they wanted to, for them to have some sort of immunity.

So now apparently I'm being the unreasonable one because I don't want them over at our house, nor do I want to go visit them at their AirBNB.  My husband seems to think he's still going to go visit with them, and he's ""not changing his plans."" So now I just look like a paranoid a-hole.  It doesn't help that one of these friends is suuuuuuuper judgy and will be offended when I tell her that I'm not going to visit with them.  Honestly though, it's probably for the best.  They need to know the consequences of their decision to not get vaccinated, and one of those is not seeing me or my kid, they have to understand that.

Anyway, just kind of ranting/venting and looking for some sympathy.  I'm not being over precautious, I hope.  This has been a hard pregnancy for me and I don't need this kind of stress on top of nearing the end of it all.",852,438,2021-07-20,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,I’m just need to hear some other stories about partners making stressful/life altering decisions during your pregnancy.,My fiancé and I live in a two bedroom condo with our stepsons. One of our stepsons is with us halftime and the other is down every weekend. It’s a great place but he was convinced we didn’t have enough space. I’m 37 weeks pregnant and we are now moving right around my due date 🙄. I agree that we need more space but I really think we could’ve waited. I’m also a full time student and the main caregiver to our stepson since his school is online due to COVID. I just feel so overwhelmed. I want to know who else feels the same. My partner is amazing but is also overly optimistic.,16,30,2021-02-07,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,In-Laws Chose to Cut Contact With Us,"This is a long story but I think typing it all out may help me process everything that has happened.

A little background to begin: My husband (31M) and I (28F) have been married for nine years. We were friends when we were young and are high school sweethearts. My husband was raised in an extremely strict, religious household. He was home-schooled, couldn't listen to secular music, couldn't drive or date until college, etc. His mother has always been incredibly strict and overbearing. Every thing has to be exactly her way and any deviation from that will cause a full blown meltdown. It may sound like we have a bad relationship with his mother but we didn't! I've known her since I was 12 years old and we have always been friendly and as close as you can be to someone who has lived over 150 miles away from you for the last nine years.

With all of that being said, my husband and I (and all of his siblings and family) have always walked on eggshells around his mother. She and his father have some very strange beliefs (which are way too intricate and bizarre to go into fully but the short version is she believes she can touch someone and feel their kinetic energy and use that energy to diagnose people with conditions/diseases. Then, she believes she can prescribe them with essential oils to cure them). My husband and I, of course, think her beliefs are complete bullshit. However, we have NEVER said that to her or belittled her beliefs or pushed back at her when she made these crazy statements. The only thing we have ever done is refuse to orally ingest the essential oils which she has always been okay with.

All of this is to say, my mother in law and father in law are anti-medicine. They are trump supporters and they are anti-vax. And not just anti-vax against the COVID vaccine. They are against ALL vaccines period. And I disagree completely but I would never try to force anyone to make a medical decision that they are uncomfortable with.

My husband and I are both very set on doing everything medically for our new child. I am 24+5 and baby is due in January so it will be the height of flu, cold, RSV season when he is a newborn. I have my COVID vaccine and will be getting my flu vaccine soon so baby should have some antibodies. However, I am not willing to risk him catching flu/COVID/whopping cough/etc. right after being born. Because of this, my husband and I decided that anyone who wanted to see the baby in person before he was six months old (which is when he should have all of his vaccines except COVID unless it has been approved by then) will need to have taken the COVID and flu vaccines as well as the TDAP booster. I want to make this absolutely clear: WE WERE NOT ASKING ANYONE TO GET VACCINATED. We were giving people the choice to get vaccinated or wait until the baby is six months old to see him in person. We planned on doing Skype visits and photos, etc. My parents (who were also VERY anti COVID vax) decided to get the vaccine the same day we told them this is what we were wanting. No questions. No arguments. Just complete respect for our decision. We did not MAKE them get the vaccine. They chose to so that they could meet their first grandchild ASAP once he is born.

My in-laws, on the other-hand, lost their shit.

My mother-in-law would not accept our request. She began arguing with my husband. Sending information that is completely false about the COVID vaccine, etc. The argument finally came to an end when she texted that she and my father-in-law would not be getting vaxxed for any reason. That the risk to their health **was not worth it.** I know hormones are at play here but, to me, she said that my child's safety and health were not worth it to her. But regardless, we were NOT ASKING THEM TO BE VACCINATED. However, she repeatedly ignored that aspect. My husband told her that he is sorry, but we are not even asking them to be vaxxed, we are just asking them to respect our decision and wait to see the baby until he can get his own vaccines to protect his health. He reiterated that this was a blanket requirement that applied to my family, his siblings, our friends, etc.

She said we were lying, that we were targeting them, and that she would not be speaking with us until we decide that they are ""acceptable people"" again. Then she simply said goodbye.

I was incredibly saddened by this but had worked through it emotionally. That is until this past Friday when my husband let me know that she had started texting him again. She started out by sending him an article with false info about the COVID vaccine. He debunked the article and then reminded her that we are NOT asking them to be vaccinated but to respect our parenting choices. She lost it on him. She said that we were horrible people for cutting them off due to political reasons. He said we had no intention of cutting them off and that we planned to do virtual visits/etc. She said that in her mind, we have cut them off. That they will not be getting vaccinated and will not be giving in to our list of demands because then the demands will never end and they will never be able to make us happy. She went on to say that we should be ashamed for being so unkind and intolerant of their beliefs and that we ""will live to regret our decisions.""

And that was that. My husband chose to stop responding to her.

But I am struggling so much with moving forward. My husband is almost relieved that we will not have to worry about dealing with his parents moving forward. But I am so deeply hurt. I feel like I have ruined his relationship with his parents (although I know they ruined long before I even had a chance too) and I cannot believe that someone who claimed to love me would put me and my husband through this amount of stress and pain during our pregnancy. That they would turn our (what I feel are perfectly reasonable) requests into attacks and make the entire thing about them. I know in the long run its best to cut toxic people out of your life but I am mourning the family we could have had. I'm mourning that my son will only know one set of grandparents because the others chose not to meet him. I'm mourning the family holidays we shared with his parents and siblings. I'm mourning the mother-in-law relationship that I always wanted (and thought I had) because I am a damn good daughter-in-law. I do know that it is also important to point out that my husband and I are not the first of his siblings to be cut off/disowned/whatever you want to call it. His younger sibling is FTM trans and cut contact with his parents years ago and my husband's older sister just recently stopped communicating with them as well). That's three out of five children who are no longer in contact with them.

If you've read all of this, thank you so much. It feels good to write everything out and I'd love to hear any advice or stories or wisdom that you all may be able to share.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the love and support! I am so sorry to hear that so many of you have gone through similar situations and I hope the advice is this thread is helpful to anyone going through something like this. Much love! ",846,254,2021-10-11,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,Has anyone dealt with an extreme amount of stress / grief during early pregnancy?,"I will be 12 weeks pregnant tomorrow. A few weeks ago my MIL died after a long battle with cancer. It was awful, but we knew she was approaching the end of her life and she was very at peace with it so we were managing our grief pretty well. 

Last Sunday, my FIL wasn't answering his phone so we went over to his place to check on him, where we found him unresponsive. I did CPR but he was already dead. Suspected massive heart attack, but I know he really died of a broken heart. He died 17 days after his wife, meaning my husband and his sister lost both their parents less than three weeks apart.

My husband is devastated and my heart is absolutely broken for him. I adored his parents so I'm grieving them hard myself.

On top of all this, also during my first trimester: 


- My SIL (husband's sister), who was my 'pregnancy buddy' because she was 6 weeks ahead of me, had a miscarriage two days before her mom died. I've been grieving the loss of having our babies grow up 6 weeks apart 


- We discovered that my husband is a carrier for a very serious genetic condition. We found out last week that I'm NOT a carrier (small win!!) so the band will be fine on that front, but we've been stressing out about it for weeks


- My own mom (who has destroyed her pancreas with 20 years of heavy drinking) relapsed after 7 months sober the day of my 8-week ultrasound. I'm afraid she's going to drink herself to death. 


All of that baseline grief/worry probably isn't good for the baby, but I'm also concerned that the absolute trauma and horror of finding my dead FIL and having to perform CPR on him (I can still hear the sound of his ribs breaking under my hands) was enough of a shock to the system to hurt the baby.

Has anyone been through an absolutely horrible time during pregnancy and ended up with a happy, healthy baby at the end? I can find articles on the effects of general stress during pregnancy but this shit is next level.

And yes, I'll be looking for a grief counsellor for both myself and my husband this week. He's handling it as well as can be expected (and I think I'm doing pretty well too) but I have a history of depression and this feels like a recipe for PPD waiting to happen, so I want to get in front of it!",41,18,2020-08-17,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,My Husband is making me feel pressure to exclusively breast feed. I want to do a combination so we can take shifts.,"We are first time parents. My husband wants me to breastfeed and never, *ever* give formula. I have a high ppd risk and wanted to do shifts so we both sleep, where we do breast milk during the day and formula at night if I don't have enough pumped and ready. He thinks formula is like junk food for babies. I've heard advice before about just doing what I want since it's my breasts but I know it will cause constant tension. He already gets on me when I buy candy, or crave food like fast food or pizza even though I eat tons of fruit and veg everyday.

 I am looking for advice on how to talk to him about this because he gets defensive and has a very ""it will be fine don't think about it until then"" attitude about everything, and I am more of a planner.

Edit: I just wanted to add to my post, that I am in no way saying my husband is bad. He is literally so incredibly supportive and amazing through this whole pregnancy. He comes to all my appointments, has done so much research to help pick out all the babies things and is over the moon excited. He rubs my feet, my back and always makes sure I am comfortable. He is an amazing man. 

This one issue is really stressing me out it's the only thing we butt heads on. I am going to take the advice here and stand my ground, and ask my midwife to educate him at my next appointment. Thank you everyone for your advice, it really takes a weight off my shoulders ❤❤",359,308,2021-12-02,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,Notes and recs from a non-baby person with a baby.,"Ok, so neither my husband or I are what I would call ""baby people."" We haven't spent a lot of time with babies. I did the standard babysitting thing when I was a young teen and hated it. In the last couple years we spent some time with our friends and their 2-5 year olds and were like, hey, these kids are pretty hilarious and smart, we should get one. Unfortunately to get a hilarious smart kid you have to survive the  newborn part first :( 

So here I am just out of the fourth trimester. My son was born February 26 after a 27 hour induction. I feel like there is so much emphasis for FTMs on labor - and it IS a big deal - but so little on what comes after. I joked with my husband about the class our hospital offers on childbirth being 10 hours long, and the class on childcare only 4 hours. 27 hours is a long time to labor but it's a tiny blip in the course of my son's life, even though he's still so young. We did learn helpful tips - the best thing was giving my husband a job (he counted slowly to 10 for each of my pushes and it really helped me, and helped him feel useful). I was glad to know about the stages of labor, and that it was normal when it got to the end and I panicked that I couldn't do it, etc. ... but at the end of the day, it's nothing compared to  being a parent to a newborn.

Look, it's annoying when people say ""enjoy your sleep now!"" Especially since I had pregnancy insomnia. But I really do wish I had been more prepared for how absolutely shatteringly my life changed after having a baby. Like, even writing it out it sounds dumb - obviously your life changes! And maybe there's no way to prepare for it until you go through it. But somehow when I'm in the bad place I manage to stumble over things like [""the 100 days of darkness""](https://www.scarymommy.com/100-days-darkness-new-baby/) and I wish I'd known about it before. I also wish I'd tried to enjoy pregnancy a little more. It was my last period of taking care of myself first! And everyone else wanted to take care of me too! I took it for granted. 

So yeah, I'll agree with that article. For me it was maybe like 90 days of darkness. The first 2-3 weeks postpartum I cried every day. I panicked thinking about my husband going back to work and leaving me on my own with this baby. When it hit about 4 pm (...or some days more like 1 pm) this dread would settle over me. I couldn't even explain what it was about. It still sometimes happens and my baby sleeps and smiles and we're cool! I worried about everything - a red mark on his skin, a sneeze, did he poop too little or too much? Was he gassy? How much spit up is too much? Should he be on probiotics? Should I be getting him on a schedule or will that ruin him? Of course, while you're trying to adjust to the immense responsibility of keeping a tiny, delicate human alive, you're also physically recovering and having a HUGE hormone dump (my doctor says your hormones don't get back to normal for close to a year, which hopefully explains why I still cry at a bunch of commercials?) I'm fairly confident I did not and do not have PPD or PPA and this was all standard.

It got easier. Slowly, and not always linearly. He became not quite as delicate. I did get him on a schedule and he took to it really well. He slept longer at night. His naps are still hit or miss, but I don't freak out about how to entertain him all the time anymore. Spoiler: babies don't know anything and literally everything in the world is new and entertains them. The hundreds-of-dollars giant swing taking up half our living room isn't half as interesting as the ceiling fan. Just like all the articles tell you, his fussiness peaked around 8 weeks and is getting less and less (lol, he cried all morning, and I cried too - but it's not like this everyday). He can lay on his play mat, or in his baby bjorn, and entertain himself for good chunks of time. He's been napping for an hour and 40 minutes! A month ago we were getting 40 minute chunks. 

Everyone will tell you that every baby is different and you don't need to buy a bunch of crap for a little newborn. It's true, but I didn't listen and you probably won't either. Here's stuff we like: 

Swaddles: these saved me. We have to transition out of swaddles soon (this is a thing I never thought about pre-birth either, kinda wish I had, kinda glad I didn't have to stress about it longer) and I'm dreading it. We used [SwaddleMes](https://www.amazon.com/SwaddleMe-Original-Swaddle-Newport-Shores/dp/B07BDT32KF/ref=sr_1_6?crid=20CC30RNXD1R8&dchild=1&keywords=swaddle+me+newborn+swaddle&qid=1590632773&sprefix=swaddle%2Caps%2C277&sr=8-6) when he was small but as he grew preferred [Halos](https://www.amazon.com/SleepSack-Micro-Fleece-Swaddle-Cream-Small/dp/B001D7JO1U/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=halo+swaddle&qid=1590632810&sr=8-1). We use the batwing method to prevent escaping, look it up on youtube. I think there are swaddles (miracle blanket maybe?) that make it so you don't need the batwing but I can't vouch for them. Around 8 weeks I started using the [love to dream](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Dream-Dramatically-Preferred-self-Soothing/dp/B0081GJ038/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3UO2AZWZ1I440&dchild=1&keywords=love+to+dream+swaddle+newborn&qid=1590632837&sprefix=love+to+dream%2Caps%2C285&sr=8-2) swaddle during naps hoping it will make the transition out of swaddles easier. TBD but he does like that swaddle too.

Bassinet: We had the Halo [Bassinest](https://www.amazon.com/Bassinest-Swivel-Sleeper-Premiere-Bassinet/dp/B07C291927/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=bassinest&qid=1590632865&sr=8-2). No complaints. Our kid was loud AF and we moved him into his crib at 5 weeks so it didn't get a ton of use, but I liked that I could swivel it every which way. We got it used at Once Upon a Child for like $140. We didn't use any of the button things on the side.

White noise: I like the [Hatch](https://www.amazon.com/Hatch-Resto-m%C3%A1quina-sonido-despertar/dp/B06XMRCC94/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2YUXOPMKD6XOS&dchild=1&keywords=hatch+baby&qid=1590632911&sprefix=hatch%2Caps%2C216&sr=8-2) because when our neighbor fires up the lawnmower and he's sleeping I can turn it up from my phone. 

[Boppy lounger](https://www.amazon.com/Boppy-Original-Newborn-Lounger-Elephant/dp/B014A7MABU/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=boppy+pillow&qid=1590633522&sr=8-4): Maybe our most used item? We plop it, he sits, and sometimes sleeps (only supervised).

It was worth the money. I got a field test unit for $100 off from the owlet website, not sure if that's still available.

Monitor: We have the [Infant Optics](https://www.amazon.com/Infant-Optics-DXR-8-Monitor-Interchangeable/dp/B00ECHYTBI/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=infant+optics&qid=1590632984&sr=8-3). My only complaint is that apparently there are monitors that filter out white noise? This one doesn't and I wish it did. It was easy to set up and we've had no connectivity issues or anything.

A word about feeding: I didn't think much about feeding my child. I was definitely ""fed is best"" but I just assumed I would breastfeed. But, my milk never came in and it turns out I have insufficient glandular tissue, so I was never going to be able to make more than 3 oz a day. First, I wish I hadn't opened all the junk I bought for breastfeeding (Hakaa, nipple pads, etc.) Second, I wish I'd had a plan for formula in the case I needed it. As it was, we scrambled to figure out our plan and the best way to switch to formula quickly and efficiently. We ended up going with Costco brand. Other stuff you may want if you're formula feeding: [Dr. Brown's pitcher](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Browns-Formula-Mixing-Pitcher/dp/B001I481LM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2SA2M9237UA04&dchild=1&keywords=dr+browns+pitcher+mixer&qid=1590633775&sprefix=dr+browns+pitch%2Caps%2C204&sr=8-1), and a sterilizer for bottles (we have the [Avent plug in one](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-AVENT-Electric-Steam-Sterilizer/dp/B0057ECYS0/ref=sr_1_2?crid=NGYQ2VJFUGWJ&dchild=1&keywords=avent+sterilizer+for+baby+bottles&qid=1590633804&sprefix=avent+steri%2Caps%2C206&sr=8-2)). Some people swear by the Baby Brezza but I don't think it's that much of a hassle to make up the bottles, and I've read there's some concern they add too much water.

Bouncer: I got a [babybjorn bouncer](https://www.amazon.com/BABYBJORN-Bouncer-Balance-Soft-Jersey/dp/B016DAWD3W/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3M092B6WBH1W2&dchild=1&keywords=baby+bjorn+bouncer&qid=1590633833&sprefix=baby+bjorn%2Caps%2C232&sr=8-2) off Facebook marketplace for $60. I did not understand how this chair that just bounced itself cost $200. I don't know why but my kid loves the thing. I kind of want another one to keep on the other floor of our house because I drag it around constantly. It pains me to say it probably is worth the $200 if you can't find a decent used one. We got [this toy bar](https://www.amazon.com/Tiny-Love-Meadow-Stroll-Stroller/dp/B072PD1FP9/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ZRNTWNXGG50U&dchild=1&keywords=tiny+love+stroller+arch&qid=1590633569&sprefix=tiny+love+%2Caps%2C516&sr=8-1) that attaches to it and it keeps him occupied forever.

Clothing: We got no newborn clothing because my husband and I are both over 6' and figured our baby would be giant. Surprise, he was 6.7 lbs at birth and wore newborn clothes for 5 weeks. I wouldn't get too many just in case, but I would get at least a couple things in each size for the first year because your kid does NOT warn you before they move up in size - they just wake up one morning hulking out of the outfit that fit fine the day before and you're like WTF. We like the [2-way zipper pajamas from Target](https://www.target.com/p/baby-3pk-llama-love-zip-sleep-n-39-play-pajama-cloud-island-8482-6-9m/-/A-54508662?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&fndsrc=tgtao&CPNG=PLA_Kids%2BShopping_Brand&adgroup=SC_Kids&LID=700000001170770pgs&network=g&device=c&location=9031313&ds_rl=1246978&ds_rl=1246984&ds_rl=1241788&gclid=Cj0KCQjwn7j2BRDrARIsAHJkxmzSRagVFsHppFzHqM0gWbvrNvyxUmLQTTap-7z4jebv3b-PmVLBUNsaAg2GEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) for when it was cooler out. Now he just wears onesies basically every day. 

Burp rags and muslin blankets: We got a TON of these, and everything we read said buy more, BUY MORE! We use them of course, but we've probably only used like half the ones we have. Our kid doesn't spit up that much. He's starting to drool a lot so maybe we'll use more as he gets older and is teething? I don't know. I don't have a preference with these, they're all pretty much the same.

Health essentials: Infant tylenol. Shampoo/body wash - we use Aveeno and it smells delish, Noodle & Boo smells really good too. We got a huge tub of diaper rash cream as well as those little paddles to apply it and surprise, our kid has never had diaper rash. I use Aveeno lotion on him. A thermometer - we got one of those forehead scan ones and our doctor was like no thanks, get a rectal one (I still haven't tbh). NoseFrida has come in handy a time or two, as well as saline drops. Gas drops!! I should invest in them honestly, I feel like all kids are gassy. I also got [probiotics with Vitamin D](https://www.amazon.com/BioGaia-Probiotics-Constipation-Pediatrician-Recommended/dp/B00NAG7AF4/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?crid=3N597R8MW5H6L&cv_ct_cx=biogaia+probiotics+vitamin+d&dchild=1&keywords=biogaia+probiotics+vitamin+d&pd_rd_i=B00NAG7AF4&pd_rd_r=de3a867e-793c-4f4a-984a-292bd6ce90e1&pd_rd_w=gV6Kg&pd_rd_wg=CVNgC&pf_rd_p=d027eaac-7531-45fe-a61e-20ae30db06de&pf_rd_r=D7Z5ZYTSPMXS6N3FDRQ8&psc=1&qid=1590633127&sprefix=probiotics+vitmain+d%2Caps%2C421&sr=1-1-70f7c15d-07d8-466a-b325-4be35d7258cc) \- apparently all babies need vitamin D supplements, I'm pretty sure I didn't know that until he was born. If you're having a boy and will circumcise, you'll need vaseline and gauze pads.

Toys: Like I said earlier, babies don't need a lot to be entertained, shadows on the wall and a ceiling fan will do it. He just sat on his boppy staring at my waggling fingers for like 15 minutes today.  But my kid does like [black and white cards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RFSSGFC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [this musical thing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YDDF6O/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). When he starts grasping stuff I have an oball and some other rattles for him. 

Pacifiers: My baby likes MAM but this is super baby specific. We got a free MAM in one of the gift bags (Target maybe?) so we were able to test it. Yay.

Carseat/stroller: We were like, we don't need a super fancy stroller, we live in car-heavy city. LOL now we walk every single day and barely drive. Thanks COVID. Anyway, we got the Chicco Bravo system and it's fine. It was easy to set up the carseat. If I'd known we'd be walking 10,000 miles his first year I might have sprung for something smoother but whatever. 

About the pandemic: Like I said, my son was born on February 26. The first known coronavirus death in the US (at the time) was February 29. My state started shutting down the first week of March. We had our last visitor on March 11, an hour long visit from my mother-in-law. We didn't see a soul for 8 weeks. It was NOT the maternity leave I envisioned. Even though stuff is opening right now, I suspect new moms will be dealing with this for awhile, whether its because your family has to travel and its not safe, or there's a second wave...  Decide with your co-parent what you're comfortable with for people being around your kid. It's up to you guys and his pediatrician. Plan with your family if they'll need to quarantine to visit. Acknowledge that it absolutely sucks! There's no 2 ways about it. My son is the first grandchild on my side of the family and my dad hasn't seen him since he was 3 days old. All of the articles you will read on getting through the newborn days will say to ask your friends and family for help. They don't say what to do when you can't. The articles will say it's fine to leave your baby crying for 5 minutes so you can eat or take a shower. It absolutely is, unless your husband now works from home and spends the day on zoom calls in your living room because you turned the office into a nursery. There's not a lot you can do except acknowledge it sucks, try to plan for it, and be a little bit thankful for the good things that might come from it (like working from home and getting to spend your breaks kissing your baby's fat cheeks instead of smelling your co-worker's re-heated fish).

Sleep: I LOVE TO SLEEP. My sweet spot is 9 hours a night. I read absolutely everything I could get my hands on about getting a baby to sleep. Bringing Up Bebe and La Pause. Precious Little Sleep. Taking Cara Babies. Moms on Call. Spoiler alert: they're all the same! Make sure your baby eats enough during the day. Use swaddles, white noise, a dark room. Put your baby down drowsy but awake. Wait and make sure your baby is actually AWAKE and crying at night before you pick them up - they cry in their sleep and it is super weird and hard to figure out when you're exhausted. Try comforting your baby back to sleep before automatically feeding (unless your doctor tells you otherwise). If you want a comprehensive read, Precious Little Sleep is it. If you want videos showing you exactly what to do, TCB. If you want the information in the quickest to read form, Moms on Call. Seriously, they're all the same. Bringing Up Bebe has more than just sleep stuff so it's a little different. We use the Moms on Call schedules, I think they're easier for bottle fed babies though.

Just a note, Bringing Up Bebe quotes [this study](https://abetterscientist.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/pinilla-birch-1993-peds.pdf) that says when the sleep rules outlined were followed, 100% of 8 week olds were sleeping at least a 5 hour stretch! That sold me. My kid sleeps through the night now for what it's worth.

Anyway, these are my thoughts as a non-baby person who has definitely had a CRASH COURSE the last 13 weeks. By the way my husband and I are now the gross people who put our baby to sleep and then talk about how much we miss him. Ew David.",1176,128,2020-05-28,stress during pregnancy

BabyBumps,For moms worried about too much weight gain,"I just wanted to share my experience because I would have loved to hear from someone like me when I was still pregnant. In the last few years, I’ve become a plus sized girl. When I got pregnant, my doctor told me to try not to gain more than 20lbs max. I can honestly say I did my absolute best. I was eating healthy, tracking it, doing everything I could the first few months because I was terrified of something going wrong with this pregnancy. I gained no weight until the end of the second trimester, and that’s when the weight came in full force. 


I went from only 2lbs gain to 20lbs in no time flat. I stressed, I worried, I bought all the fresh veggies and fruits and threw away all the junk and the weight just kept piling on. I was eating only 1400 calories a day! I also became more and more hungry. After I reached 30lbs I sort of gave up trying, and I felt awful about it. I ate whatever I felt like. My Dr. was amazing and kept telling me to try and eat as healthy as I could but not to make myself crazy with the stress of it. By the end of my pregnancy, I gained 45lbs and felt like absolute ass for it. I cried so many nights thinking I was hurting my baby and myself and I would never get the weight off. 

Now sitting here 11 days postpartum, looking at my healthy little babe, I’m only 6lbs over my pre-pregnancy weight. We are breast feeding and I know that helps with weight loss, but I’m completely amazed how fast the weight came off. My kiddo was 7lbs 12oz when she was born and is eating very well, and I feel silly for all the self hate and stress I piled on myself during those last few months. 


I guess my advice is to listen to your Dr, eat as healthy as you can, but give yourself some credit and love, you’re growing another human. I wish I had spent some of the time just being amazed at what my body was doing rather than obsessing over my weight the entire time. Obviously, this will not be everyone’s experience, but be kind to yourself.",400,111,2020-12-30,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,"My mom neglected my safety for ""granny points""","Edit: This post kinda blew up so I'll address a few comments all at once! Thank you to everyone who listened to my vent. I posted this while I was just overwhelmed and upset at the situation I'm in. I'm sorry to the other mommas who relate and have also dealt with boundaries being crossed. It's hard, especially during pregnancy! 

A few mentioned I shouldn't be going out until I'm tested. I know this. We went out for ONE errand cuz it was something we had to get done. We haven't left the house since!!

We ordered a test kit but it's taking a while to arrive. We aren't going out for groceries or appointments. Anything we can reschedule or cancel we did! We went out that one day for a short time to renew our business license (we have to get it done by the end of the year... which is coming up soon). We tried doing it online but there was some weird error so we went in to make sure we did it correctly. We own a business and it's our livelihood, if we don't renew our license, it can cause huge problems! It wasn't something someone else could do for us. We are both vaccinated, +booster, double-masked, and sanitized constantly while we were there. We canceled my OB appointment, our therapy session, and everything else.

It's DEFINITELY safe to say she's not allowed to see LO for a long long time... This definitely showed us she didn't care about the baby's safety over her wants. I know the person my mom is... but I'm still a little shocked she did this. I want my baby to meet her grandpa but I don't think it'll be possible since he lives with my mom :/ I think that's what hurts me the most cuz i love my dad.

Also, I was NOT alerted anyone was sick at my parents' home. My older niece was at my sister's house and her little sister has been at my parents' home since the holiday break has started. My little niece was NOT sick. My mom basically snuck my older niece over and my sister allowed it by driving her over. Rationally, I SHOULD have left when my older niece came. I admit to that 100% but again, I mentioned I struggle with boundaries and guilt from my mom and I'm in therapy right now for it. At the moment, I froze and I couldn't get myself to leave after seeing my niece gush over me. 

Some of you have never experienced a narcissistic family member and the control they have on you. My mom gives me immense anxiety and it took me 25 years to finally seek out therapy for it. I've only been in therapy for a few months. I'm trying my best to overcome them for my baby and set boundaries but I don't always succeed. Obviously, when I'm away from them, my rational brain knows what to do but at the moment I freeze. I admit, I froze despite months of working with my therapist. I already have a lot of guilt from it and frustration because I feel like I failed my baby.

I really don't appreciate people accusing and being mean on here. I've lived with guilt-tripping from my mom since birth. Please do not throw that at a stranger online without knowing the full situation. I appreciate the people who are genuinely trying to give advice but there were a couple of people being downright rude. If you don't have experience with trauma... just don't comment.

I have a right to my feelings you guys... you don't have to agree but that's what rants/vents are for. I'm not trying to cause arguments but I don't appreciate rude comments! Thank you!




Original:

I'm 38 weeks pregnant and I'm sitting here going from tears to rage 🙈 I'm just so frustrated and angry. Sorry for the long rant.

My mom has always been good at guilt tripping me. I'm in therapy now for it but some things still slip through the cracks. Most recent debacle has left husband and I sick and unable to get covid testing. My due date is Jan 6th and I had to cancel my OB appointments and I'm just UGHHH.

My nieces and I are very close. My sister wasn't the best mom so I ended up filling her role for most of my 2 nieces lives. I got married last October and went LC with most of my family (which unfortunately meant my nieces too). I have immense guilt about it and my mom likes to use it against me since that's all she has left.

My mom has recently been pestering me to visit her and see my nieces ""one last time"" before labor since after I'll be busy with my own LO. I agreed cuz I did miss those kiddos a lot and it is true that I'll have even less time for them.

Well the night before, I get a call from my mom saying that the older niece won't be coming over cuz she's sick. Cool. I don't wanna catch anything so I asked to reschedule but she asked me to come and visit little niece. She had been staying at my mom's since break started (older niece was at her home with her parents). She ensured me little niece wasn't sick, so I agreed. 

I went over with my husband and hung out with my little niece. It was all fine until my older niece swung through the doors and ran to hug me. Turns out my mom told her to come anyway as long as she wears her mask. But then my mom kept forcing my mask off to feed me and telling me, ""It's fine!"" And my niece is 10 so sometimes the maks would slip or she'd take it off when she's playing 🙈

Well... it was not fine. Husband and I BOTH are now sick. There are no tests available near us. All kits in local stores are sold out. We had to cancel my OB appointments and labor could happen any moment and I'm STRESSED. Every time I eat or drink my throat burns 🙈 it's taken away my appetite and it just praying it's a normal throat cold.

The thing that makes me so angry tho is I told my mom we got sick... and she goes ""oh yeah, our house is a MESS right now. I'm sick, dad's sick, both your brothers are sick. Nieces' whole family is sick."" AND SHE DIDN'T  TELL ME?!?!?!? 😤😤 I HAD TO CALL AND TELL HER WE WERE SICK FIRST. 

She tried to hide the fact everyone was sick and she guilt tripped me for not coming over on Christmas to eat dinner with them... KNOWING WELL people were getting sick in her household. She called me paranoid and pitiful for being ""so afraid"" to eat at her house. 

Now that I'm sick, she keeps calling me to ""make sure"" I'm not getting worse and ""give me advice"" to get better quicker. She keeps telling me ""there's nothing we could've done. What's done is done. Older niece wanted to see you so badly. How can I say no?!"" There was a LOT she could've done! SHE COULDVE NOT LET SICK PEOPLE COME OVER OR RESCHEDULE... OR NOT LIE?! And she keeps repeating ""thank God you're not as sick as your husband. He sounded really bad."" 😤 He is my support person in labor.. and I'm getting worse by the day. IT'S ALREADY BAD.

She keeps calling and the convos are making me angrier. Our last convo literally went like this:
Mom: hey I'm just checking to see how you guys are doing. Still sick?
Me: yes... we're still sick.
Mo: oh, well of course. Colds don't heal that fast; it takes a while.
Me: 😐 I know... But you asked.
Mo: did you take medicine and gargle?
Me: yes, we're taking care of it. I can't just take whatever medicine cuz I'm pregnant.
Mo: well duh, you're pregnant. You should go to the doctor!
Me: no... cuz they're gonna tell me the same thing.
Mo: what're they gonna tell you?
Me: Probably take some kinda medication? 
Mo: oh, yeah but you shouldn't cuz you're pregnant.
Me: I... KNOW.
Mo: are you home?
Me: no we had errands.
Mo: but you're sick! and big as a ""mountain!!"" You should stay home cuz you can pop any minute.
Me: I'M AWARE OF MY SITUATION. BUT I STILL HAVE STUFF TO DOOO 😤

She's driving me NUTS. And if i don't pick up, she starts to spam me! When I forget about what happened, it's like she calls to remind me 🙈 

I'm already so miserable and pregnant. Baby won't let me sit or sleep. And now I have a sore throat and a burning head. 😤 and then there's the fear of going into labor in my current state! AGHHH",142,111,2021-12-29,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,We made it through our 20 week Anatomy scan ❤,"TW: Pregnancy Loss

Earlier this year, we found out our baby (first pregnancy) had a non-viable neuro tube defect during our 20 week scan, and we were absolutely devastated. So many feelings, tears, and anger to be had during that time. Also, because of COVID, I was at that appointment alone which made it incredibly more devastating for us. I also had to go through the D&E appointments and procedure alone, which about killed my husband.

However, after many therapy sessions and time spent together, we started trying again around May, and found our we were pregnant again soon after; this time armed with new information and new vitamins. We made it through the 8 week appointment, the 12 week high-risk scan, and changing doctors (a story for another time, but let's just say they should be glad I didn't burn their practice down).

This morning was our 20 week scan, and I can only tell you about the stress and anxiety we've had the previous days. My poor husband about had a nervous breakdown this morning before we left.

It went well this morning. No doctor giving us terrible news, no driving home alone in a blur to tell my husband the terrible news, just lots of tears and holding my husband's hand as we drove home stunned that we made it. 

Bless the poor, stressed ultrasound lady as I gently explained to her why we didn't look absolutely thrilled to be there, and why we weren't talking much. She was so kind. I really should send her a thank you card.

Thank you for reading if you've made it all the way through. I had to scream into the great beyond that is Reddit for just a minute.",397,55,2021-11-01,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,"Preeclampsia, COVID, & My 30 Week Delivery","Well. Here I am. Laying in a hospital bed for nearly a week now. I’ve been a regular commenter on this thread throughout my pregnancy.

On October 3rd, 2021, I was rushed in for a cesarean delivery of my 30 week pregnancy. My baby girl is currently in the NICU and will be for several weeks. 

I have preeclampsia and thought I would share my story.

My pregnancy has been difficult. I had some health scares and had to get more than one RhoGam shot. I had to see a high risk specialist a couple times because she was measuring too small. (Those later concluded that the pregnancy appeared normal). I have also been physically ill and dealing with severe anxiety I’ve never experienced before being pregnant. I knew that I couldn’t wait for pregnancy to be over and that I would never do this again. All I wanted was my baby girl. 

With all of that in consideration, my baby has been healthy. She’s been very very active my whole pregnancy. Her heart rate and everything have appeared normal. So in general, I had a healthy pregnancy.

With fears of the COVID Delta Variant looming and hearing of pregnant mothers passing away with it at an alarming rate, I consulted my OB about getting vaccinated. Thankfully, she talked me into getting it. I am still so glad I got my vaccine. 

On a Sunday, I got my first shot of Moderna. Felt fine. Only had a sore arm. Three days later, I got pulled into an office at work and was warned that one of my coworkers had just went home and tested positive with Covid. And she was apparently very sick. I had been in very close contact with her. 

Some days later, I started getting a light cough. More days after that, I lost sense of taste and smell. I eventually tested positive for Covid basically at the end of my “quarantine” period. I never had fever or difficulty breathing - which I personally credit my vaccine shot for. One thing I thought was weird though was that *I started lactating*. And it was a lot. And I’ve been lactating an alarming amount since. 

After all of that passed, I got my second dose of Moderna weeks later. 

My OB had mentioned that women who contracted Covid during pregnancy are having a lot of preterm labor complications, so I was to start doing weekly ultrasounds at 32 weeks. She mentioned watching my blood pressure because the risk of preeclampsia is higher as well. COVID and pregnancy is so new, studies can only tell so little right now. 

I began using a simple wrist cuff to check my blood pressure daily. All normal. I have never had blood pressure issues before in my life.

Then everything changed about two weeks ago. 

At around 29ish weeks, I started getting “moderately high” blood pressure readings at home. I noticed my doctors office and went in for some testing that Monday. My tests came back “okay” but nothing to confirm preeclampsia or serious concern. My blood pressure was elevated but not concerning. I went Thursday for a follow up to my lab results. 

It was funny, really. That Thursday I’ll never forget for the rest of my life. I walked in and she said, “Hey, Dr. ___ is not here. I can have you see a nurse practitioner or we can reschedule.” I said “Eh I’ll go ahead and see them.”

She sat me down and took my blood pressure. It was 180/102. Everything changed immediately. 

Before long, I was being pushed in a wheelchair to the hospital across the street. I was placed on a magnesium drip over several hours and my Preeclampsia diagnosis was confirmed after some labs. 

Friday morning, my blood pressure had regulated so well. They decided to take me off the mag and send me home that night. They told me to come back if my blood pressure elevated again with blood pressure meds. 

Saturday night, I felt mostly fine. But my blood pressure readings were essentially 160/98 all day. So I had my husband take me back. 

They ended up discharging me again after 2 hours. They told me to stop stressing myself so much. 

Sunday. October 3rd. I will never forget this day for so many reasons. I woke up at like 6:30am and had a light tightness in my chest. I thought oh, it’s just these meds. I woke up a few hours later and I realized my breathing was labored. Like it felt like my lungs were the size of golf balls. But I tried to take their advice and relax in bed. It continued. My blood pressure was also high 180’s. I decided to call the oncall doctor before going in again. 

That doctor saved my life. He told me to immediately go back to the hospital and he would meet me there. 

Once there, my breathing became so shallow. I begged for oxygen so they gave me a mask. They began running tests on my lungs and heart. My heart was stressed and I had developed fluid on my lungs. My blood work came back that my liver was failing. The doctor said we will have to deliver to begin curing your preeclampsia. Otherwise you will die. 

I asked, “When are you going to deliver?”

He said, “Very soon.”

And a team of nurses began filling the room and prepping me for a cesarean delivery. I still couldn’t breathe and based on everyone’s demeanor in the room, they didn’t know if I would survive this or not. I got very scared. I told my husband to contact our pastor. 

Fast forward, and my heart was considered strong enough for a spinal tap, as opposed to general where I would have been asleep. I was awake for the whole thing and that moment they pulled my baby girl out and I heard her CRY… Best moment of my life. I knew she was alive. I was still alive to hear it. 

Due to circumstances, I was not able to see her or hold her. She was immediately taken by the NICU team. I then laid on that operating table for probably another 45 minutes with my husband sitting next to me.

Fast forward some more. I have been hospitalized all week due to my preeclampsia. I am still struggling with blood pressure, but the fluid on my lungs is slowly going away. I am breathing normally. I am now on a plethora of medications trying to keep the symptoms at bay. I am told I will deal with this for at least for a few weeks.

As for baby? She’s doing SO WELL in the NICU and will be there for 6-8 weeks. She’s tougher than me!! I love her so much. 

So many doctors and nurses have commented on the amount of preterm labors since Covid. It will be interesting to see what studies say about it years from now.",252,58,2021-10-07,stress during pregnancy
BabyBumps,"Graduated 40+2. Positive, hypnobirthing, unmedicated vaginal delivery","Just like everyone else, I read all the birth stories on this sub and loved learning about other peoples’ experiences. My baby is 3 months old as of yesterday and I had a great time looking back at all the pictures and videos since her birth. The fourth trimester is real and while it didn’t seem that crazy when we were in it, looking back on it I’m grateful things have evened out some (and by things I basically mean sleep). She’s stronger, smiling, and it all seems normal now. 

My pregnancy was straightforward and uncomplicated. I like being pregnant and generally felt pretty good. I took unisom to help me sleep and magnesium for headaches - both helped! I did fail my first one-hour glucose test but after two weeks of home monitoring, I was told I probably had a mild insulin intolerance and was cleared to stop testing etc. It was a good wake up call, though, because it helped me rethink what I was eating and I felt better as a result. 

It’s worth mentioning that I did get effing COVID at 37 weeks pregnant. It was by far more stressful than it was bad - my symptoms were mild and I honestly felt better before I even got my positive test back. My doctors were not fazed (“rest and hydrate!”) and promised I would get care no matter what and that the only difference would likely be that we’d have one dedicated nurse. Fortunately everything was fine by the time I went into labor. Speaking of labor... 

Our due date came and went and then, at 40+2, I was sitting on the couch around midnight with my husband (what else do we do). I moved and felt something. I was pretty sure it was my water, it was instantly wet. I remembered from our birth class that to confirm it was your water and not just regular pregnancy discharge or pee you should do the yoga pose polar bear for 20 minutes and then if you get up and more liquid gushes out, it’s your water! So I did that and more liquid came out! Eek! It was tinged a little pink. I called our midwife on duty (the only one we hadn’t met (but we were about to become BFF for life)) and left a message. This was around 1 AM. I wasn’t having any contractions so we went to bed and tried to get some sleep. From 5-6 AM I had a few kind of intense contractions but I got up and ate something and was able to go back to sleep until 9. I talked to our midwife when I woke up, everything was very chill. I was having random contractions but they were not long and very bearable. She said if things didn’t progress by noon we’d do a castor oil milkshake (which I was a little wary of because I’d heard it can basically just make you poop your brains out). It was raining so I just listened to the good vibes labor playlist I made and paced around the house. I also worked on getting everything together to get to the hospital. I talked to my parents on the phone, texted, and just felt nervous and excited. I was still leaking tons of fluid, still pinkish. It was feeling very real but it also felt very early in the process. 

By noon nothing had changed so off husband goes to get castor oil, peanut butter, and ice cream as per the midwife’s instructions. I had to eat the milkshake, wait for my stomach to start gurgling or for 20 minutes, whichever came first. Then go on a brisk 10 minute walk, then sit on the toilet and hydrate for 10 minutes. Then walk and sit again. So finished the milkshake around 1 (for the record, it was delicious) and then we started walking around the block after 20 minutes (didn’t want to get too far from home). I felt fine. Saw our neighbor, said “today’s the day!” Sat on the toilet and drank water. I was maybe having some contractions but not really. 

Now, the second round (so about 40 minutes after finishing the milkshake) contractions started ramping up. By the end of the walk I was having to pause to get through them. I guess castor oil brings on the contractions hard and fast but eating it with the fat and protein from the ice cream and peanut butter kept me from just pooping. We made it back home and I went to sit on the toilet. I remember things starting to be intense at this point. 

Throughout the later weeks of my pregnancy I’d been listening to, and really enjoying, hypnobirthing mediations from the app Gentle Birth. I collected a lot of affirmations that really started to come in handy at this point, as well as listening to some of the familiar tracks. Things like:

 A power of nature moves through me

I welcome each wave as it brings me closer to meeting my baby 

Relax your forehead 
Relax your jaw
Relax your hands 

My baby and I are the perfect birth team

My body knows exactly what to do
My baby knows exactly what to do 

Sitting on the toilet, I listened to a grounding meditation which had me focus on my feet on the ground, connecting me to the earth. This was really impactful because it helped me be present and focused (and not freaking the eff out). I was starting to have to vocalize getting through the contractions. At some point I called to my husband or he appeared in the doorway and I was just hanging on him  to get through it. I would try to track them in an app but there didn’t seem to be any pattern. The contractions were pushing out more fluid and around 3 I texted my midwife a picture of what I thought could be the bloody show (I definitely asked “can I text you a picture of this” and she said yes lol). Also good signs of things happening, she said. 

I think I was supposed to go on a longer walk and call her at 5 (getting a little fuzzy here) but I could not imagine walking. I was on our bed in the fetal position like, “call her!” thinking it was time to go to the hospital. Our plan all along was to labor at home for as long as possible so I could avoid as much medical intervention as possible and have an unmediated birth. But at this point I was like, fuck it, I need to be at the hospital whatever that means.”Our midwife said, “I don’t know any women who can labor in the fetal position. For your next contraction, get on all fours and I want to hear you.” So I did and it was really intense - I was being verrry vocal at this point and suddenly my body convulsed in a push! I was like, “my body is pushing!” People say it feels like you have to poop but for me it felt like a wretch like my body was going to make me throw up. I wasn’t nauseous, just the power there of expelling something. Our midwife very calmly said, “how far do you live from the hospital” and it was time to go. Again, from our birth class, our teacher said you know it’s time to go when you don’t give a fuck about anything other than getting to the hospital. Sure enough, I almost walk out of the house half-dressed like, “FUCK IT BURN IT ALL DOWN LET’S GOOO”

The 10-minute car ride was an out of body experience. I felt like freaking David After Dentist, I was levitating during the contractions. I kept coming back to the grounding meditation which had some tree/root imagery. So I was levitating and picturing my arms as branches and my feet as roots. It was wild. My husband was focused af, I have no idea if he was silent or talking, but I know he tried to go gently over the bumps. 

At, I think, 4:45 (about 5 hours after the castor oil) our midwife called and asked where we were as right we were turning into the parking lot. She was just a few minutes behind us but had called ahead and they knew we were coming. We pulled up, left the car, and walked in. The nurse asked if I needed a wheelchair I was like, sure. Totally normal in between contractions. I just kinda splayed out in the chair, as a 40+2 pregnant person might, waiting. They wheeled us right across the hall to the delivery room (smart layout, hospital!) and two nurses greeted us. The room was all set up with nice twinkle lights, there was a tub, etc. I was looking forward to laboring in warm water. They had me put on a gown and I was just like, yup, strip down clothes in a pile. As I got on the bed, our midwife came in. The first thing she did was take my mask off for me (thank you!). Then she was like, let’s check how dilated you are. I was having the classic “I don’t know if I can do this” feelings. The contractions were so intense. And then she said, “you’re 10 centimeters you can push on the next contraction.” WAIT WHAT!!? I didn’t even have time to wrap my brain around what was happening. She had me get on all fours to push. I was more on my elbows, ass in the air. I just buried my face in the pillow and puuuuushed and the way my breath exited my body and the sound I was making was from another realm. Longest exhale of my life I didn’t know there was that much breath inside me!

At one point she said, “reach down and feel the head!” and I very halfheartedly reached a shaky hand down and was like yeah great uh huh. 3 contractions later I move on my side so my husband can pull the baby out. My body is just expelling this baby, pushing her out with its own force. I’m like moan yelling, I don’t even know. Then she was here and on my belly, all skinny limbs and gray. They’re rubbing her vigorously to help her come into her body and I’m just laying there, looking around the room wide eyed saying, “holy shit! Hoooooly shiiit!!” There is a picture of me in this moment (thank you nurse for asking if we wanted her to take pics!) and it is hilarious. I don’t know what is open wider, my eyes or my mouth. 

My husband and I were totally shell shocked for most of the golden hour. The baby latched right away and I feel like I was just laughing and repeating holy shit. I did get 1-2 stitches for a surface tear, it stung a little and I think I was singing to the baby to distract myself. The nurses pushing down on my stomach to make my uterus contract was straight up painful and initially my body was the most sore from that. 

I don’t know, y’all, it was as fucking wild. I still can’t believe it happened like that but I feel lucky to be able to think fondly of my first child’s birth and I did enjoy writing this while she slept on me (and then nursed and then fell back asleep). 

I have a couple of other things I want to add:

I did not use ANYTHING from my hospital bag. No snacks, no robe, no nothing. I was in the gown the whole time. I watched a million “what’s in my hospital bag” YouTube videos and the only thing I needed was my long phone charger (also note: if you buy a new charger be sure to bring a block for it!). 

I for real credit the hypnobirthing meditations for helping me to stay calm and present. My husband and I have a picture of us at the hospital and I’m 10 centimeters dilated and smiling. I felt incredibly calm for most of the time. 

Some other things I was glad I did: upgrade my phone to something with a great camera (sooo many baby pics) and buy a new pair of glasses I actually like, since many days I don’t put my contacts in. 

In baby life we’ve found the Hatch to be invaluable, as well as white noise on a phone. Bouncing on a ball puts baby to sleep. Tracking things on Huckleberry helps figure out what might be going on with the baby but really it’s all the same - tired, hungry, both. I love the rubber ducky with the thermometer for bath time. Get some cute hats, seeing my baby in hats and headbands explodes my heart.

One of my biggest worries was (and still is) “is she too hot/too cold.” Another pregnant Reddit friend suggested getting a temperature gauge/thermometer for each room and I did and it rrrreally gives me peace of mind. I know what temps are warm or cool for us at the point. 

Ok! That’s all! Thanks for reading, I’ve been writing this post in my mind for months. <3

BabyBumps,Breastfeeding is making me suicidally depressed and I still cannot stop,"I don't know what to do. I'm losing my mind and slipping back into mental illness but I cannot stop.

Baby is 18 days old. He was born in a sudden, emergency c-section out of fear for his life. The guilt of not being able to have a 'normal' birth has haunted me since, and the physical recovery has been hell. My maternity leave is now over and I'm back in school full time, which I do remotely while caring for my son. I feel like I'm drowning and the main reason is the feeding.

Since day 1 with my son, we had trouble with breastfeeding. He had a tongue tie we couldn't get fixed until after we left the hospital, which none of the lactation consultants noticed. Instead, they made me feel like a terrible, stupid human for not being able to figure out how to feed him the right way. We saw no fewer than 5 consultants during our stay. They even made me feel terrible about using a shield the one time I dared to. My nipples were covered in scabs, it hurt so bad to feed him that I would cry every time but I didn't want to unlatch my son since getting him to latch at all took eons. I wanted him to eat. So I just took the pain. They encouraged me by listing all the benefits from breastfeeding. Those benefits replay in my mind every time I think about going to formula - how could I deny my son those benefits, even if it causes physical and mental pain to me?

We got home from the hospital after 5 days. Breastfeeding even after the tongue tie was fixed has been an incredible challenge. The anxiety of supply haunts my every waking moment. He often will still latch the wrong way. I have to use a shield every time or he screams and cannot figure out how to eat. I pump religiously, 25-30 minutes every two hours, and my supply is still barely keeping up. In fact, I think its dropping. I cry every time I feed him. I cry every night after my husband goes to sleep. I get bruises in my breasts from pumping or shredded nipples from feeding him and I just cry. I feel it is affecting my bond with my son. I get so frustrated with him, that he cannot latch and eat the way every baby is supposed to know how. I get frustrated with myself, that my body cannot do anything right. From the birth to now, I have ruined this child's early start in life by sucking at every step of the way. I see posts on places like r/breastfeeding or on Facebook where moms are happily feeding their baby anywhere with no issues, talking about special breastfeeding bonds, mourning ending ""early"" at 1.5 - 2 years of EBF. My goal has always been 6 months, but now I feel like shooting myself in the face thinking about dealing with this that long. I have been off my prescribed medications for the whole of 2020 for my son and still am, because of breastfeeding. It wasn't as much of a problem in the pregnancy, but this has been the hardest thing I've ever done and I feel myself slipping into a dark place.

I catch myself having suicidal ideation again, which I hadn't had in about a year. I spend every day dreading waking up because it means starting the hell cycle of pumping and feeding and worrying and struggling. All I wanted was to feed my son ""the natural way"" after I couldn't give birth to him ""the natural way"" and I can't even do that. I think often that my son would be better off without me in his life. I wonder why I ever thought I'd be a good mother. I just want this pain and stress to end. Why can't I make enough milk? Why couldn't things go as planned? Why am I physically incapable of just feeding him formula? If anyone else posted these thoughts I'd say 'fed is best,' why don't I think this way for myself and my son? I think about using formula and I instantly meltdown. My husband, god bless him, does not understand how much this process is eating away at my mind and soul. My mother doesn't either - she EBF with no pumping for four children with no issues. I hate myself for not being able to figure this out. I hate myself for feeling angry at my son, who is blameless and a baby. I hate myself for being such a failure at motherhood when it's all I ever wanted in life. After the c-section, BF him was the new goal to counteract my shame. Now its a new source of shame and the deepest fear I have is not being able to feed my son. 

I'm sorry if this offends anyone and I'll probably delete it later I just have nowhere else to put this and I can't keep it all inside anymore. The worst part is that even if every person who saw this told me to switch to formula, I still don't think I could bring myself to do it.",97,94,2020-10-06,stress during pregnancy

I’m working non-stop from 8am until 6:30-7pm Monday - Friday in the same chair just feeling I’m chained to my computer. I take maybe 30 mins to eat lunch. I had to scale it back and lay down occasionally because I was starting to spot like clockwork every Friday (probably from the stress of sitting in one place for so long).

BabyBumps,How much weight did you actually lose after giving birth?,"*TW: mentions ED and weight.*

I’ve been feeling really down about my weight lately. I know weight gain comes naturally with pregnancy, but it just feels so disappointing after I worked so hard to lose 115 pounds. I’m just about 33 weeks pregnant and have already gained 30 pounds. I feel like I can see the weight gain around my neck and face which is ruining my self-esteem, but at the same time there is so much guilt around trying to lose weight while pregnant. I feel happy that I have a healthy baby growing inside me, but it’s hard not to feel sad about my appearance after losing weight and just seeing it pile back on so quickly.

I’m curious if it’s actually true what everyone says - that most of the weight comes off after birth? I’ve been told now by several doctors and friends that the baby, placenta and amniotic fluid alone weighs around 25 pounds, but I feel like they might just be telling me this to deter me from dieting (and because I do suffer from an eating disorder, so to avoid another relapse). 

I feel like I’m in a good enough place mentally to hear the truth. I’m far along in my pregnancy and don’t want to do anything to harm the baby, so I won’t be dieting until after I give birth. I guess all I’m really looking for is to hear other people’s experiences. I don’t want to get my hopes up and expect the 25 pounds to just magically disappear after the baby comes out if that isn’t true. I would rather know the truth than be let down after going through something so intense like labor and delivery.

BabyBumps,"Please, ask for a third trimester ultrasound. (TRIGGER WARNING)","TRIGGER WARNING: STILL BIRTH

I know they are common, but they are still not standard at every practice. If they aren’t where you go, please request one. Whatever the price is, pay it. 

I have been an active member of this sub since I found out I was pregnant in April. I was due January 5. My pregnancy was completely healthy besides persistent symptomless BV that finally went away at my last appointment (ironic). My anatomy scan was perfect, baby was measuring spot on. I was 37 weeks and had had labor signs for weeks. Bloody show, cramping, so much pressure. I had been told since 28 weeks that he was head down. My last two appointments the midwife commented on how low he was. She said to be careful on waiting too long because he may just fall out. I was told, multiple times, that he was a perfectly average size baby. My fundal height was never spot on, but close, within a week or so at every appointment. At one appointment I measured two weeks behind and I was assured this was normal (I think I even posted in here). I gained weight at a normal rate.

Last Saturday I noticed baby hadn’t moved much. I had been so busy with last minute preparations and my placenta was anterior, so I was used to his movements being more subtle. I thought that was normal. As a side note, that is NOT normal. Your baby should still feel like an alien popping out, just more muted. You should still feel the big movements and rolls. 

I got out my Doppler and there was nothing but silence. The day before I had checked it and his heart beat was loud and strong.

I can’t bring myself to type out the full whirlwind story of what happened Saturday night, but it was chaos. At first they thought they had the heartbeat, but it was mine. The hospital did a scan and found his heart to be still.

Most importantly, my baby was not healthy. He was not average size. He was not head down. He had severe IUGR. I had absolutely no amniotic fluid. His butt was engaged in my pelvis.

I went home to rest to come back for an induction the following day. My two older kids were still up, at midnight, because we had had to rush out so suddenly. We had to tell them their sibling had passed and then put them to bed.

Then I went into labor. It was hard and fast and the most painful contractions I’ve ever had. We barely made it to the hospital. I pushed him out in a matter of minutes. He came out foot first. 37 weeks and 3lb 5oz and 16in.

When my placenta came out we immediately knew what was wrong. It was completely calcified. He hadn’t been getting nutrients for a long time. He had consumed all his fluid and had nothing left to replenish it. He was slowly withering away in my stomach while I meal prepped and finished his nursery and washed all his clothing that would never have fit him.

My care team clearly dropped the ball. After using them twice with my two older children, my gut had told me something was off the whole time with this pregnancy. I often felt dismissed, my care felt impersonal. I cannot wrap my head around the fact that multiple women put their hands on my stomach and told me my baby was average sized and head down.

I blamed myself at first for using a birth center, but what I have come to find already is that this happens everywhere. It happens with midwives and it happens with OBs. Cord and placenta issues are two main causes of stillbirths and can only be diagnosed with ultrasound. Of course it is not fool proof. Women who have routine third trimester ultrasounds can still have something tragic happen. Things get missed. Not all care teams are idiots like mine. But reality is, an ultrasound would have caught his growth restriction and we would have at least had a chance to save him. 

Also, pay attention to your baby’s movements. I know it’s beating a dead horse, I heard it all the time. I was so busy preparing. Reality is, his movement and routine had drastically changed. I chalked it up to him being so low and my anterior placenta. My stupid anterior placenta, I let it be the scape goat for so many things that should have been red flags. 

This pain is unbearable. And there were so many points in time it could have been avoided.",1725,235,2021-12-25,birth weight
BabyBumps,"Late traumatic graduation post, a horrible situation that should never happen. TW","TW: Stillbirth 

I can't believe I'm posting this right now. I never thought I'd be in this situation. But I spent my whole pregnancy lurking here and in the pregnancy sub and after reading so many graduation posts I always imagined sharing the birth story of my son. I think both of our stories deserve to be heard. 

Loukas was due September 24th 2021. I had an uneventful pregnancy, every test and check up was perfect. I'm a 25 year old FTM, healthy weight, healthy everything. I did everything right. Always listed as ""low risk"".

At my 38 week appointment I brought up induction. I saw no reason to go past 40 weeks and just wanted my baby in my arms. In fact, I had a bad feeling in my gut about going past my due date. I tend to do a lot of research and reading so maybe I psyched myself out, but still, that gut feeling twists like a knife to this day. My OB (who is great) said that it would be a ""social induction"" until 41 weeks, meaning I'd be on the list after every other medical reason induction was cleared. I crossed my fingers and told myself to be patient.

At 38w +6 I got a cervical check in hopes of a membrane sweep. Nada. ""Sealed shut"". I kept being moderately active and hoped things would change soon. Two days later I started losing my mucus plug and 2 days after that I had light cramping off and on for 2 days and my bloody show. The timing was perfect and I started to get hopeful and excited. I did a big grocery shop and got everything around the house finished. 

At 39w+6 I woke up at midnight with definite contractions. I feel like it's important to note I had only been asleep for about an hour before. They were about 10-15 mins apart and painful enough that each one woke me up. Around 2am I realized they weren't going to stop and got out of bed with my contraction timer. I started half watching the (then new) Squid Game and tried to breathe through the contractions while timing them. They were still a little inconsistent, 5-8 mins apart, lasting 60-90 seconds but they never stopped and the pain was enough to take my breath away and have me gripping the coffee table like I was going to break it in half. I got so excited thinking that he would be here soon but I knew first time labours can take a while so I let my husband sleep. He got up around 6am and was very surprised to see me groaning through a contraction on the floor. I had an OB appointment already scheduled for 11am and I didn't want to go to the hospital too early and get shoo'ed away so I decided to wait and get checked at the appointment. 

Around 11 we headed to the appointment. At this point I could barely stand through the contractions and realized this was that dreaded ""back labour"" I had heard about. My contractions were still 5-8 minutes apart and SO painful but I could keep thinking and breathing through them. At the appointment, the receptionist took one look at me and joked that I should have gone to the hospital, she didn't want to be the one to deliver the baby. She took my BP (normal) and enthused that I'll be a mommy soon. My OB did another check and I was 1cm, 80% effaced. She finally did that membrane sweep and warned me that it would make everything amp up and that I could ask L&D for pain relief if needed. My husband and I went home but after a couple hours the spasms in my back got so bad that I couldn't breathe at times and I was yelling through the pain. I have a pretty high pain tolerance so this freaked him out and off we went. 

I'm going to cut out a bunch of details from here on because my experience at the hospital makes a mess of my mind. We got to the hospital around 3pm and I got hooked up to monitors. Baby looked good and OB on-call said I was still 1cm but 90% effaced. Loukas was kicking normally and knocked his monitor off, a healthy little guy. I had to stay I the outpatient area for about 2 hours because they were looking for his heart rate to do ""something"" (??!!??) before they could give me morphine. Morphine seemed like a good choice then because they said it might be another day before I could be admitted and at that point I was running on 1 hour of sleep with no hope of sleeping that night. My contractions were consistently 3-10 minutes apart for the whole time I was in labour and painful enough that even with morphine I was being woken up by them. I eventually got the shot and went home to rest. I would doze off for a few minutes and get woken up with so much pain I could barely breathe, then doze off again. Rinse, repeat. I ""slept"" like that from maybe 7pm-12am and spent the rest of the night watching Netflix and trying not to wake my husband up in case the contractions got more consistent or my water broke. 

Its now my due date. It was around this time that I started to get some aching in my hips, it was uncomfortable to lay on either side, so I spent most of the day sitting/standing/pacing to try to get through the contractions. I was in agony trying to pee and I blamed the back labour. It didn't burn like a UTI (although I've never had one) but trying to use that muscle group hurt so much I couldn't pee without making whimpering noises. It felt like the muscles in my pelvis were ripping apart. By 2pm we decided to go back to the hospital. My contractions were still irregular-ish but they wouldn't give me a break and I was screaming  and groaning in the shower trying to get through them. I figured I had made progress and I was exhausted. My husband was finally allowed to come up with me this time. I had (accidentally) cried on the phone to a nurse, breaking down and telling her how much I was suffering and in need of his support and advocating (I couldn't form words during contractions and the previous day they kept questioning me). We had a wonderful nurse, got hooked up again and figured we'd be admitted by then. Nope. Only 2cm but 100% effaced. I asked about staying to be helped along/induced but the admittance criteria was 3+cm or broken waters. There were 4 people ahead of me for medical inductions and this would still be considered a social induction so no luck. 

This is where the story gets hard. Not at the time of course, back then I was all excited and cheery even though I have never been so exhausted and in so much pain. My husband and I ended up being in the outpatient room for about 3 hours. They kept waiting for his heart rate to do that ""something"" again so they could send me home with another morphine shot so I could try to sleep. The nurse kept coming in and out of the curtain to check the monitor, and kept leaving. I was so exhausted I was falling asleep mid-sentence and being woken up by a contraction a few minutes afterwards. My wonderful husband held my hand and made jokes to get me through it. The nurse said she got what she needed from the monitor but wanted the on-call OB to check to be sure. She called our baby boy ""sleepy"". That word rips my heart out to this day. The OB came in with the ultrasound machine and checked him. We saw his face, his heart beating, he was practice breathing. She joked that he had such chubby cheeks. Then she pushed on my belly, hard, and rubbed him. His little hand waved and she said that he looked fine and that I could have the morphine shot. We left and stopped at McDonald's on the way home. I got a big chocolate shake knowing that Loukas would love it. Something about that word ""sleepy"" already didn't sit right with me but the nurse had explained that labour was tiring for the baby too and considering I had barely slept it was normal. I hoped the milkshake would give him a little pep and energy to keep being healthy. We got home, ate, and I did my painful pseudo-sleep from around 7-11pm. But this by this time my hips were in so much pain I couldn't stand to lay on either side for more than 30 seconds (we had told the hospital this). I ended up sleeping propped up on a recliner so I was practically sitting. I was awake and dealing with contractions until about 5am, when I managed to get back in the recliner for a few hours and doze between contractions until around 8am. 

It's now 40+1, contractions have been non-stop but the nurse last night had implied that if we came in the next day she'd find a way to keep us in the hospital. I spent the morning walking around the house and around the block to try to progress. At this point I'd been in labour for 50-60 hours and I could barely function from the lack of proper sleep. I couldn't even sit through the contractions because on the pain in my hips and back. I had to stand or lean on something most of the time. We had complete confidence that we would be admitted this time so we took care of the cats and such and I got so hopeful, I was still struggling to breathe through the contractions but I had a kind on second-wind mentally that made them easier to cope with. Around 2pm we excited left for the hospital and knew we'd be coming home with our baby. Fucking hell...

When we got to L&D's reception I saw the same kind nurse we had the previous day and she excitedly brought us to the outpatient area to be checked. I got dressed in the gown for the third time and she said she'd check me before bothering with the monitors so we wouldn't be in suspense. 2.5cms, 100% effaced with ""bulging membranes"". Then she got me to lay down and started hooking up the monitors. Right after she stared moving his monitor around my belly I had a bad contraction so I didn't notice when she started calling in back up. When I finally opened my eyes there was around 5 people surrounding the bed and one was the OB who was handing the plug for the ultrasound to my husband asking him to plug it in. I didn't understand what was going on and I was still in a lot of pain from my back spasming with the contraction. Suddenly multiple nurses were forcibly flipping me to my left side and then my right, I think they had asked me to first but I was in too much pain to move. It was so painful to be on my sides that I was yelling out, and at the time it didn't even cross my mind what was happening, I was just upset that they were hurting me and being impatient. Once they dropped me back to laying on my back, I opened my eyes and saw the on-call OB putting gel on my belly. My husband was already gripping my right hand and that kind nurse suddenly grabbed left hand and held it. I'm not a touchy person but I was still so confused, I didn't think anything was wrong. At first I was uncomfortable but thought ""how nice of her to try to hold my hand through the pain. Then it hit me. Everyone in the curtain was staring at the screen. I turned to the nice nurse and desperately asked ""is he okay?!?!"". She said ""that's what we're trying to find out"". I swear my heart stopped beating, I know I didn't breathe at least. After a second the OB said ""I'm sorry, there's no heartbeat"".

At that point my world collapsed. I wailed and sobbed. I couldn't stop screaming ""NO"" over and over. (Poor girl getting an NST in the bed on the other side of the curtain). I swear I had felt him kick on the drive over, it had been maybe 10 minutes since. I begged the OB to cut him out right there and give him CPR, I desperately looked around the room for something to cut myself open with so I could ""save"" him. They said they needed to confirm with an official ultrasound and suddenly they were wheeling me to the elevator to go to imaging. In the brief seconds I was able to open my eyes between wails and tears, I saw my husband helping guide the end of the end of the bed. I am so grateful for him, he cried but kept himself together enough to help move me around and if I hadn't seen him I think my heart would have stopped from grief right there. The official ultrasound confirmed no heartbeat. While we were there I had another contraction and I remember being so confused. For some reason I thought if something went wrong the labour would stop, I kept asking why I was having them and what was happening but no one answered. I ended up back in the outpatient area and lost every ounce of energy in me. My eyes were shut and I was limp. They took tons of blood from me and started an IV, I barely knew what was happening. At some point they took my bra off with my husband's help, I was so out of it I remember them asking but I couldn't reply or move. I was shattered. We got moved to a delivery room shortly after. 

I must admit everyone on staff was sensitive and so kind. This hospital has a delivery room specifically for losses and we spent our whole stay in there. At first my mind was spinning, I couldn't understand what was happening or that I was still in labour and about to give birth. I had to wait an hour or two until the anesthesiologist could get there and spent the time crying with my husband. So much of the experience is blurry in my mind, likely from the lack of sleep and the trauma. We were asked a lot of questions for medical history, nothing had predicted any kind of risk. I ended up with an epidural and spinal block and spent the night being induced and so numb I could barely move. They got a gurney and put it beside my bed so my husband could get some sleep with me. We took care of each other and he got some sleep. I spent the night awake, one hand holding his and the other wrapped around my belly, cherishing the last time I could hold my son inside me. When I would eventually doze off and my arm would relax and slide off my belly I would get jolted awake and hold him tight again. The 1-on-1 nurse we had throughout the night cried for us when she thought I was asleep. I am so grateful for her and her strength to answer the hard questions that kept popping into my head throughout that long night. 

By sunrise I was 10 cm and after about 20 mins of pushing Loukas was born. 8:54am, Sunday September 26th. 7lbs 2.6 oz, 52cm. Perfect in every way. I planned to keep my eyes closed and only see him once they had cleaned him up but I couldn't help peeking after his dad cut his cord. Full head of dark hair, that heartburn thing is a myth by the way. Another baby cried in another room and I had to cover my ears and beg for it to stop. I ended up with a few internal stitches, at least 4 but I wasn't counting. That uterus massage everyone talks about is really horrible, I couldn't help making noises from the pain. The local organization cleaned him up and took pictures, prints, and 3D castings of his hands and feet. I'm so so grateful for them, those memories are everything to me. We held him for about 4-5 hours but the hospital didn't have a cooling cot so eventually we had to let him go and leave (not at their insistence but our own acknowledgement). I have never loved anything in the world so much. Eventually I decided it was time to tuck him in for the last time in his little bed and I got up before the epidural had completely worn off. The only way I stayed upright was adrenaline and determination that I would not drop my baby. I forgot I didn't have a diaper or anything on, just the gown and a sheet under me, so I bled all over the floor and my poor husband had to call a nurse to deal with the mess and me. We left shortly after, I refused a wheelchair. Walking out of the hospital with a memory box instead of a baby is a horrible experience. By the time we got home I was in such shock that I couldn't stop trembling and no amount of blankets could stop me from being cold. I took a couple bites of bread and passed out.

The past two months since we got home has been surreal. Everything is still set up for him to come home any day. I still can't believe he's not coming back. I have 4 weeks of leave left and I'm still in no state to go back to work. I can barely eat or sleep and every day I feel like I wake up in a nightmare. I'm all 5 stages of grief at once. If it wasn't for my husband I wouldn't be here. I never thought this could happen. We're still waiting for the autopsy results, but my OB got the tests back from the placenta and said there was potentially an infection that was missed. I'm so angry about it all, what happened to modern medicine?!?! An infection? How did they miss that? But hopefully we'll get more information soon. I need answers. 

Thank you for reading this far. I don't want to scare people with our story, I just feel like my son's story needs to be heard. He was here and loved. I hope everyone can spend a minute loving the good boy he was too. Mommy and daddy love you baby boy, you didn't deserve this.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your kind words and support, if I could reply to you all individually I would ❤

Just to clarify: My whole labour process was from Thursday-Sunday and a total of 81 hours non-stop. The first part until I was admitted on Saturday night was latent labour but was likely stalling. I was in active labour for about 16 hours of the 81. I was 1cm at 11am on Thursday and 2.5cms when we got the news on Saturday around 3pm despite walking around a lot and getting some rest from the morphine. Once I was admitted and induced I was 3cm around 6/7pm and 5cm sometime around 3am. They manually broke my waters then (there was meconium but possibly from after he passed I think), and then I was 10cm around 8am. At one point in the night they had the drip so high I ended up in ""uterine asystole"" or something like that. It would have been bad for the baby but I told them if it wouldn't hurt either of us not to worry about it. 

Also to note: I am in counselling and will be investigating once all the info is back. I will post an update once everything is figured out but that might be months from now.",1535,246,2021-11-26,birth weight

BabyBumps,The 20 anatomy week scan: What sonographers are looking at,"Hi everyone! As a Sonographer, I thought you guys might be interested in learning about what we have to know/look at for the 20-week anatomy scans. This is a medical procedure, and we are looking at many potential problems that can occur during a baby's growth. It can be a pretty stressful exam for a sonographer. This is sometimes the only exam where baby is really checked over, and they want to be careful to not miss anything and stay on schedule for their other patients, while also trying to be professional and kind to the mamas. It can be a hard balance, but we try and do our best.

This might be a little long, but I'll try and break it up.

If you have any other questions about procedure and what's going on behind the scenes, you could ask in r/ultrasound. While we don't do diagnoses there, or interpret images, we are happy to help people understand what is going on during the ultrasound, why we do/don't do certain things and what the machine is capable of!

I'm hoping that this information is informative and interesting, and doesn't cause anyone additional stress. I hope that you walk away from reading this realizing the depth of our checks on the baby at the 20 week scan and take that positively, not worrying about every possible thing that could possibly go wrong.

&#x200B;

Step 1: Count the babies, count the placentas, find fetal heart activity. We first need to know what we are working with, so we start with a broad overall view. After figuring out all the we have to deal with, we then make sure that the baby or babies have heart movement, because if we can't find that, the exam and day is going to change for the worse. Everyone comes in excited for a gender reveal and assuming their baby is healthy, but unfortunately that is not always the case. :(

Step 2: It's not just about the baby. After checking out the baby and placenta, we look at the woman's cervix and uterus, to make sure there are no problems there - related to or unrelated to the pregnancy.

Step 3: Back to the baby. We measure the amount of amniotic fluid, making sure there is not too much or two little. They can mean different things to a pregnancy, and can let us know if there might be any problems or potential problems to be monitored for (diabetes, preeclampsia, or just simple dehydration).

Step 4: Assuming from now on there is baby with a healthy heartbeat found, our next steps are to make sure that the organs are on the right sides of the body and figure out how the baby is laying within the mother. We check that the heart and stomach are on the left sides of the body, and use that information to know what way the baby is facing as they inevitably flip around during the exam.

Step 5: The actual fetal anatomy survey. I'm not going to put this in order, because we can't always do it in a specific order. We try to do it in ""chapters"", and keep related images together. Order depends on the position of the baby. There are so many things to check, and sometimes the baby is not in a good position to see some things accurately. So, we take them in the order that the baby allows, and hope that they don't turn over too fast, or that they do turn over after we finish one side, haha.

BRAIN: Since the baby's skull isn't bone yet, but cartilage, we can see through it. Our goal is to find certain brain structures. Since the baby's skull forms/grows from the outside towards the center, if we can find certain structures near the center/midline of the brain, it means that everything until that point has grown correctly. If you're building something and mess up step 1, the rest of the steps are going to get messed up too. By proving that different central brain structures are the right size, shape, and in the right place, we prove that the baby's brain is correctly formed. There are 6 brain structures that we have to locate and image, and a few of those we have to measure. At this time, we also measure the head circumference and diameter, to make sure that the baby is at the right size for its age. Lastly, we look at the brain's blood supply, and make sure that it is getting all it needs.

This is also where we can, if we are in the right spot, take a measurement of a nuchal fold. If the nuchal fold measurement is too large, it means that there is an increased risk of a genetic trisomy disorder. Which means any of the disorders related to having 3 of a chromosome instead of two. (Trisomy 13, Trisomy 18, or Trisomy 21/Down's Syndrome)

FACE: We look for a profile shot (this is often one of the ones you take home), to look at the nasal bone, lips, and chin. We also look at the lips and nose from a second, straight on angle, that lets us see the contours better. We want to find a nasal bone, because if it is absent, it is associated with some of those Trisomy conditions and means that there is a higher risk that the baby has one of them. We look at the lips to make sure that there is not a cleft lip. If we know about a cleft lip ahead of time, it can be easier on the parents and hospital staff to fix it as soon as possible after birth. We can also see the lenses in the eyes, which means the baby does not have cataracts.

\[I'm going to say a little something about what we call ""soft markers"" here. Some of these things such as the nasal bone being absent, or the nuchal fold being a little large, are called SOFT MARKERS. There are quite a few of them, and they happen in completely normal babies. We call them soft markers because if there is just one of them, we are not at all worried about the baby having a problem. When they show up in multiples however, we recommend further testing because there is an increased risk of some disorders. But having just one of them is a normal variation.\]

SPINE: The baby needs to be back facing up for this one, and we look at the whole spine from the neck to the tailbone. We have to make sure that each vertebra has 3 points, and that the skin is covering the entire back over the spine. We're looking for spina bifida here, a failure of the spinal cord to be enclosed.

ABDOMEN: We look at the lungs, heart, kidney, stomach, and bladder. When we can see the stomach and where the umbilical cord comes in, we know that we are at the right spot to measure the abdomen. This measurement helps us guess at the baby's weight.

LUNGS: Are they there? Are there any masses or fluid pushing on the lungs?

HEART: The position and axis that it is on. It should be about mid-chest, but pointing to the left. We need to check that all 4 chambers are there, and that there are barriers between them and valves opening and closing as the blood moves. We look at the different ways that everything connects to the heart, and make sure everything is in the right place and connected correctly - no holes anywhere.

KIDNEYS: We make sure they are the correct size and in the correct places. We check to make sure that urine is draining properly, sometimes it can get a little ""backed up"" and the kidneys will be dilated.

STOMACH: We just need to see that it is on the left side.

BLADDER: While the baby is inside you, its urinary system is working and practicing. The baby swallows amniotic fluid, which we can see in the stomach. Then, if everything is connected correctly and working, we can see the bladder fill up, then empty. All this happens at least 1 time per hour, so we need to be able to see it to confirm that everything is working correctly. So during the 1 hour scan time, we need to be able to see the bladder full at one point, and the bladder empty. They don't have to be in that order, though. Often we will check at the very beginning if the bladder is full or empty. If it started out full, and when we look later it is empty, we know that it is working. If it was empty, and now it is full, we can assume that it is working properly as well.

LIMBS: You would think this would be easy, but when the baby is flailing around in there, sometimes a sonographer realizes that they just measured the same arm twice and have to redo it. As part of our measurements for size, we measure the length of the femur (thigh bone), which also helps for weight calculations. Other than that, we are just taking pictures looking for presence/absence of all the limbs and bones. start at a shoulder, take the upper arm image, follow it down, forearm, and then get a hand with all the fingers. Repeat other side, then repeat with legs.

And that's the full medical anatomy scan of the baby.

Step 6: Placenta and umbilical cord - make sure that it has all of the arteries and vein it needs (2 arteries, 1 vein), and make sure the placenta looks healthy and isn't too close to the cervix. When I was learning this, I wasn't surprised to hear that we had to check and make sure the umbilical cord wasn't wrapped around the babies neck, with so much moving around. I was surprised, though, to hear that we only get worried if it is wrapped around the neck 2 or more times. apparently, once is normal and perfectly fine, they'll probably flip it off with all the moving about in no time.

Step 7: The part everyone was waiting for. Check out those fun bits, and find out if you're going to have a boy or a girl. Hopefully they're not crossing their legs and shy. :)

&#x200B;

After the anatomy scan, some places offer a trans vaginal ""cervical length screening"" to see if you are at-risk for preterm delivery. If you've had a preterm delivery before, they usually recommend you get it. If you don't have any risk factors, they don't often press if you're not interested. For the screening, they have you take your pants/underwear off, feet in the stirrups, and insert the transvaginal probe. Then they take measurements of your cervix length, and then a few videos of what the cervix looks like when there is pressure being put on your abdomen, like there would be when you have contractions. For this, we press firmly on your lower abdomen while taking a clip of the cervix. If it opens up at all, that could be a cause for concern to be discussed with your doctor.

A transvaginal exam can also be useful if your placenta is particularly low-lying. Then the tech can see exactly how close it is to the cervix, or if it is covering the cervix at all. Sometimes it can be difficult to see, especially if baby's head is low.

&#x200B;

I hope that didn't scare anyone, and I hope it was interesting to you guys.

Have a happy, healthy pregnancy!!

BabyBumps,Husband thinks the baby is big because I didn't work out?,"I made an account to post this as it is quite an embarrassing situation.

I am currently 36 weeks and 3 days pregnant and the baby has been measuring large since the 20 weeks scan. He is always above the 95th percentile and currently, he weighs a little over 7lbs. I had a false labour scare yesterday with contractions happening nonstop and when I went to the hospital they told me to take paracetamol and hold off until 37 weeks. However, my midwife and everybody else thinks the baby will come early due to his size. His fundal measurement is 42 weeks. 

Today my husband started saying things to me such as if I worked out during this pregnancy this wouldn't have happened and I am the reason the baby is big. According to his google research, pregnant women are supposed to work out at least 150 minutes a day. It's true that I| barely work out during the pregnancy, especially when the gyms closed due to COVID. But him blaming the baby's size and potential early birth on that is getting to me and I feel like he's being an asshole.

I am by no means overweight and weighed about 100lbs before I got pregnant (I was underweight my whole life before this). I also have polyhydramnios. I don't want to mention this to anybody in case my husband comes off as an asshole but am I right for thinking he's way out of line?",897,437,2021-06-29,birth weight
BabyBumps,My OB was the worst and I’m still not over it,"It’s been over a year since I gave birth, but I’m still mad about how I was treated. I think this will be the first time saying/writing exactly everything she did wrong. 
- she was very particular about my weight gain when I was pregnant. It was always her first questions during checkups (this one I know is common, unfortunately) 
- she was also very adamant about cutting out sugar and carbs (I’m not even diabetic btw) 
- I knew I was going to poop during delivery (I could feel it). I wasn’t nervous about it because everyone says they don’t make it a big deal when it happens. YEAH WELL it happened as soon as I started pushing and my OB literally said out loud “SOOO MUCH POOOOP!” Like what for?!!
- I had a very hard time pushing my baby out. I was screaming, crying, saying I couldn’t do it, etc. it was the anaesthesiologist that was trying to encourage me, saying I could do it and just needed a few more pushes, while my OB just kept telling me her other patient had zero anaesthesia and was worse off 
- I had 4th degree tears that needed to be stitched up for over an hour, so my recovery was ROUGH and very painful. I consulted with my OB the day after I gave birth, and she proceeded to tell me that in her 30 years of practice, my tearing was the WORST she’d ever seen, and that if im not careful I could have a permanent hole between my V and ahole that would need surgery. This made me cry the whole night, as if I wasn’t already crying for the pain and all the emotions that come with giving birth 

I just really hate her.

ETA: Thank you so much for reassuring me that what she did was NOT okay. There are a lot of suggestions to file complaints, review her, etc. but unfortunately there’s a lot of politics and connections at play. She is kinda high profile (which is why I thought of going to her in the first place). So if I do it and it gets out that I spoke out, it could make the situation ten times worse. Although I may look into complaining to the hospital about her (OBs where I’m from don’t have their own practice, they just have clinics at different hospitals). I don’t know why but it’s just so difficult to find a good OB where I’m from (I live in Asia, you can message me if you want to know exactly where just so you can avoid this lady). This terror doctor wasn’t even my first OB during my pregnancy. She was already someone I switched to because the first one was extremely negative and made me worry constantly for absolutely no reason. Good doctors shouldn’t be this hard to find!!

ETA 2: I JUST REMEMBERED ONE MORE INSANELY TERRIBLE THING ABOUT THIS WOMAN!!! I asked her about getting the covid vaccine because I was breastfeeding (just about which brand, not about whether or not I should get it cause of course I was going to get it) . She said that it’s not a vaccine, that it alters DNA, and that she won’t be getting it, what more a breastfeeding mama. O M G",1247,229,2021-11-13,birth weight
BabyBumps,TW | Always trust your gut. Baby stopped breathing. In intensive care now.,"I remember one day after her birth I told the doctor that something was wrong. She would gag and spit much more than normal. I remember how they said it's fine,she was fine, even after she failed to gain weight. They send me home. My midwife said she is fine so I tried not to worry despite her throwing up after every meal. 

We were at the doctors Office yesterday because she keeps losing weight and throwing up. I told them it seemed like she had stomach issues. They told me it's fine, she is just a slow eater. They send me home.

Yesterday was fine and we were hopeful. This morning she threw up more than ever before. She screamed in pain. Those were horrible screams I will never forget. She screamed and screamed and then she stopped. I held her while she turned purple and limp. I screamed and cried while her dad got the car. We drove to the hospital where they put her on monitors and now my little baby girl is laying in a cold bed with cables sticking out everywhere and all I can do is watch. We both stood over her crying. Ive never seen my husband cry before.

She is 11 days old. She is suppose to be laying on my chest not in this cold Box. She has severe stomach issues. They took a lot of blood. Finally someone who believes me. They are gonna do an ultrasound of her stomach in an hour so hopefully that is going to get us some answers.

If you think something is wrong, TRUST YOUR GUT!!! Ive had multiple doctors and my midwife tell me I am overreacting and too inexperienced to know. Now I almost lost my little baby because I trusted them to know better. Always always always follow your gut. Get everything checked out. You know whats best for your baby.

BabyBumps,Husband doesn’t want me to breastfeed,"Most important at first: I do strongly believe fed is best. No matter if breastfed or formula. It’s just a personal wish of mine to breastfeed. 

Nobody in my family or my husbands family ever breastfed. They are all against it. As soon as I got pregnant with my first child I got to hear in every conversation how bad breastfeeding is, how much it hurts, that baby’s have to starve if you breastfeed etc. 
I tried to breastfeed my first for two weeks and gave up due to absolutely no advice and too much pain to handle, I was just overwhelmed and didn’t want my daughter to starve because she lost weight (10% of birth weight). 

I‘m now 29 weeks pregnant with my second and want to try to breastfeed again. I found a midwife who is specialized in breastfeeding. I am so afraid of telling people I want to try it again. In a conversation I told my husband and he is absolutely against it. He argued how bad it is and that I will let the baby starve if I try. I told him that it’s my decision and ended the conversation. I will not tell anybody else about my plans because I know they are strongly against it but I‘m so afraid they will attack me when the baby is here and they see I breastfeed. I‘m also afraid that it will hurt so much again.
Has anyone advice how I can handle family who are against breastfeeding? Just tell them to keep their opinions to themselves doesn’t work, tried it several times. 
And has anybody advice for sensitive nipples? I really want to work it out this time. 
Sorry for the long rant, thanks for reading.

Edit: my midwife (she is also a lactation consultant) will come to my house every day for 7 days to check on the baby and me. If he says anything negative about bf I will tell her to educate him. I will definitely breastfeed the baby, I’m very stubborn on this. If it doesn’t work out I will of course use formula but I want to try it first. There is a breastfeeding support group in my town with weekly meetings/online meetings and I will attend these.

Edit2: thank you all so much for your support and your advice for breastfeeding. I got really good advice that I will use. I’m positive that it will work out this time.",495,414,2021-12-13,birth weight

BabyBumps,What I'll do again for my next baby,"I enjoyed reading motherly advice on here before I had my girl 8 months ago at 36 weeks/6lb. Here's what stuck with me, YMMV, every pregnancy/baby is different:


1. Hospital bag/Hospital:


 The hospital has everything baby needs, focus on your own comfort. Hormones made me hot and sweaty so feeling clean helped a lot.


Postpartum room essentials: 6' phone charger cable, robe, sleep mask, water bottle, bath sheet, flip flops, soft clothes/underwear (I'm a size 16 and the mesh underwear was uncomfortably small), facial wipes, dry shampoo, gatorade, nail clipper, razor, snacks, folder to put all the paperwork/copy of marriage certificate for the registrar

Edit: Lip balm! Epidural drugs make your lips super dry


The newborn going-home clothes I brought were too big for my 6lb late-term preemie baby, next time I'll pack a preemie outfit.


2. Home prep


I put a mattress protector on my bed around 30 weeks... Good thing since my water broke in my sleep, surprise!


Next time, I will clean and sterilize some bottles and pump parts in advance. You don't want to be reading pump instructions while your hungry baby cries because they're unable to latch onto your breast.


I will also have some freezer meals ready, it wasn't the end of the world, but it would have been nice.


3. Diapering/ Cleaning


I've cleaned a lot of baby messes by now, these work:  
- Dawn blue dish soap for fresh stool stains. 
- Oxy clean soak for yellowed hand-me-downs with oxidized drool stains. 
- Dreft stain remover to pre-treat spit up/milk stains before putting in hamper (I keep the spray bottle near the changing table)


We keep disposable blue underpads for diaper changing, it has mitigated the damage from many pee fountains. They're also great in the diaper bag and in the car, and are useful to contain poopsplosion-baby while you run a bath for them.


We cut a dedicated sponge for cleaning baby dishes and toys. Regular sponge is too big to fit most of them.


4. Random 


I avoid Velcro now, it's loud/startles my baby and gets stuck to things in the laundry.


I will remind myself baby doesn't need to be stimulated all day long.


I'll never have enough bibs and they will save countless outfits


Baby congestion was a big problem for us. It affected her feeding and sleep and we didn't know why at first! Spray saline and a nasal aspirator saved us.


In an emergency sometimes the floor is the safest place to put your baby. No baby has ever fallen off the floor.




5. Finally, these are things from our registry that we use/don't use:


Must (we use these every day multiple times a day): 

- Bouncy seat

- Nursing pillow (for feeding, napping, playing, climbing, protect while sitting on floor...)

- Sound machine (white noise, ocean waves...)  

- Ubbi diaper pail. 

- Dishwasher basket for bottle parts. 

- Bandana bibs. 


Nice to have:

- Wipes dispenser with weight (like Oxo Perfect Pull)
- Haakaa


Not used:

- Bottle brush (bottles go in dishwasher)  

- Too many fitted sheets (guess I was expecting night blowouts on the reg), really only need 2

- Baby monitor (small enough place that we're always within earshot)

Thank you for reading this novel. On mobile, holding a baby, and English is not my first language, sorry if something looks wrong. Good luck!

BabyBumps,You’re strong than you think,"It’s taken me a while to feel okay with sharing my circumstances with others but I think it’s important and I’m hoping I can help someone else if they are silently going through something similar.

*********

At 37 weeks pregnant, I found out my husband was having an emotional affair with a coworker. I stopped eating, I stopped sleeping (and you know it’s already difficult to sleep while pregnant). I felt my heart breaking constantly. We tried for years for our miracle baby, I just couldn’t understand it. I worried about how it was affecting my unborn daughter. I felt like a failure as a mother already and she hadn’t even been born yet.

She was born via c-section full term, a perfect weight, in perfect health. An angel.

I left when she was 1 week old — still in pain from my section — with nothing but a suitcase full of mine and her clothes and a few other essentials and moved in with family. While it’s been nice to have them keep a roof over my head and feeding me right now, I do everything else on my own. Exclusively breastfeeding, all the nappy changes, all the midnight waking, all the baths, all the spit up covered laundry, all of it. I’d be lying if I said it isn’t hard sometimes or that I don’t still sometimes cry myself to sleep on a night because I never imagined I’d have to do this all on my own.

But you know what I’ve found? That I can function on very little sleep and do it with (for the most part) a smile on my face. My capacity for love and care hasn’t diminished despite being so broken — it’s actually grown by leaps and bounds. My patience isn’t as thin as I once thought it was. I’m not as selfish as I had always assumed myself to be. I’m not the weak person  I felt I was when I found out about the affair. I’m strong and capable and determined and resilient and worth so much more. Being alone isn’t as scary as I thought it would be.

More importantly, I found out that I’m a fantastic mother. I absolutely kill it every day and sometimes I feel like thanking my ex for doing what he did as this has been so eye opening for me. I go to bed every night — exhausted, covered in spit up, greasy from not showering, with a sore back and sore nipples — and feel accomplished because my girl is thriving and happy and loved and that’s on ME.

So, to any woman out there who is pregnant or just having given birth and are struggling with a failing relationship (for whatever reason) please know, you are not a failure. Leaving is not as earth shattering as it feels. You CAN do this. Reach out for help. I started antidepressants the day after I found out at 37 weeks pregnant and I’m grateful I did as I’ve avoided any PPD/A to speak of. I’m in therapy every week
Via Zoom. I’m going out on walks every day with baby in a carrier because the fresh air really helps. I have friends who know about my situation and they have been invaluable for verbal support.

Your baby needs you and YOU are enough. If you’re not being supported, if you’re in an abusive relationship, if you’re being disrespected or cheated on, you don’t have to stick around. You and your baby deserve so much more.

*And a bonus nugget of information — my ex has come crawling back. He’s seen what a wonderful woman and mother I am, how I’m thriving without him, and he is now grovelling to be back with me.*

BabyBumps,My hot takes on popular pregnancy books! (Warning: words!),"**Ina May's Guide to Childbirth**

Ina May Gaskin

**tl;dr** \- crunchy AF but worth it

The author is a midwife who started a birthing commune in Tennessee called ""The Farm."" First half of the book is crunchy but enjoyable birth stories. For example, one woman's labor wasn't progressing. So the midwives called in a friend of hers who had just given birth a few hours before. The friend gets in the bed and the two have a naked snuggle session, allowing the friend to ""share her birthing energy."" Apparently it worked because things picked up and the woman in labor had her baby soon afterwards. So ... I guess I'll keep this tip in mind if my labor stalls??

Second half of the book is about Ina May's philosophy and has some information on medical interventions. I would not trust her medical advice because some of the statistics were flat out wrong (or possibly just outdated). She definitely has a bias against interventions. However, I liked her general advice. Her ideas about the importance of a calm environment were very convincing.

⭐️⭐️⭐️  /5

&#x200B;

**What to Expect When You're Expecting**

Heidi Murkoff & Sharon Mazel

**tl;dr** \- get an app instead

A big chunk of this book is a rundown of weekly and monthly symptoms and baby updates - the same information you can get from any pregnancy tracking app. The rest is mostly an unnecessarily long nutrition plan. Sprinkled throughout are cheerful little paragraphs of total surrender to the horrors of American late stage capitalism. Insomnia got you down? Here are some makeup tips to cover your under-eye circles! No maternity leave at work? Don't worry, if you have an office job you can keep working until your contractions are five minutes apart, way to go super mama!! :)

&#x200B;

**The Birth Partner 5th Edition**

Penny Simkin

**tl;dr** \- lots of good, unbiased information

The only book on this list which uses gender-neutral language throughout! Highly recommended for you and your partner to read and discuss. Goes over the different stages of labor, how you might feel and what kind of support you might need in each stage, and what are the medical interventions available. Takes a neutral position on medication, just gives the information so you can decide for yourself. Has topics to discuss with your partner ahead of time, like rate yourself from 1-10 on whether you want or don't want pain medication and how your partner can support you in each case.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ /5

**Babies Are Not Pizzas: They're Born, Not Delivered**

Rebecca Dekker

**tl;dr** \- an insider's view on the problems with hospital birth and possible solutions

The author is a nurse and a former professor of nursing. She is most well known for founding the popular website Evidence Based Birth, and podcast of the same name.

The book starts out with the birth of her first baby, and how she felt disempowered and traumatised, despite the birth being mostly uneventful. She goes over the routine hospital practices that are not evidence-based, but caused her so much harm. For example, after the birth her baby was taken away for several hours and she did not get to have skin-to-skin time. The rest of the book focuses on her other births and her career, how she eventually quit the university to run Evidence Based Birth full-time. She also talks about the reasons behind harmful hospital practices and how they could be changed.

The biggest lesson I learned here is that it is important to give birth in a hospital where the caregivers are supportive of the kind of birth you want to have. For her third baby, even though the author was a nurse and a professor, she was afraid to go to the hospital for an induction because she knew her wishes would not be respected.

**Bringing Up Bebe: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting**

Pamela Druckermann

**tl;dr** \- don't let yourself go just because you had a baby, do you even love your husband?! You'll feel so much better if you stay cute :) This is fine. This. Is. Fine!!!

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills because everyone seems to love this book but I thought it was mostly a bunch of sexist garbage. France, as depicted in the book, seems to have a real problem with toxic beauty culture and the author thinks this is great, actually. She wishes she had French in-laws because they would have body shamed her into losing the baby weight faster.

The advice about getting kids to try new foods was helpful. But to get there you have to read through many pages of bullshit about how you owe it to your husband to stay attractive after baby, and how you shouldn't let him see you below the waist during vaginal birth because you will disgust him with your gross body. There's one passage in particular about an American woman having her baby in France:

>""She wanted to give birth on a balloon, give birth in a bath,"" \[her husband\] recalls. He says the doctor told her, ""It's not a zoo here, or a circus. Basically you will give birth like everyone, on your back, legs open. And the reason is that if there is a problem, then I can do something.""

So in support of her thesis that childbirth is better in France, the author includes an anecdote about a doctor who is an arrogant bastard with no respect for patient autonomy. And the author thinks this story is great?? That you will wish your hospital was like this?? I dunno, maybe I'm too much of a feminist bitch to appreciate the delights of a medical system that doesn't allow me to make choices about my body.

I could write a much longer post on this book, that was only a teaser of my many feminist bitch complaints!

**Active Birth - Revised Edition: The new approach to giving birth naturally**

Janet Balaskas

**tl;dr** \- do a prenatal yoga video instead. Possibly worth it for the pictures

This book describes the benefits of staying active during labor, and different positions you can try. It hasn't been updated in the last 30 years, so it contains advice like: your hospital bag should include change for the call box. There is also a yoga routine but I found it hard to follow written descriptions of yoga poses. Just go on Youtube and find some prenatal mobility or yoga routines.

However, the best part by far is the pictures of fully nude women of all different body sizes, giving birth in various positions, with their 80's bush proudly on display. These photos inspired me so much! Every time I came across one it was like, yesssss queen slayyyy!

Edit to Add:

**Expecting Better: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom is Wrong and What You Really Need to Know**

Emily Oster

tl;dr - finally some advice that treats you like an adult! But take with a grain of salt.

A popular book on this sub. The author is an economist, who goes through the research on many contentious pregnancy topics such as: prenatal testing, forbidden foods, and weight gain. I liked her approach that rather than just telling you not to do XYZ, she gives the actual numbers so you can weigh the risks for yourself. Also doctors don't always keep up with the latest research, for example telling you no caffeine despite the ACOG and NHS both saying that caffiene is safe up to 200mg per day. Knowing the reasons for different food prohibitions was also helpful, such as the difference between listeria (deli meat) and salmonella (runny eggs)

However, her lack of medical knowledge made me skeptical at times. Especially in the area of weight gain and the risks of a large vs small baby. I got the feeling there is a lot more going on medically and maybe the author wasn't aware of all the implications. Also this book shouldn't be taken as a free pass to do all the forbidden things. I was tempted to just read the author's conclusions at the end of each chapter and think, ""Well she's pretty smart, I guess I'll do what she did!"" But remember, you need to really consider the evidence yourself, keeping in mind that she could be missing important details.

BabyBumps,[Update] Husband thinks the baby is big because I didn't work out?,"My original post is here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/oa7nze/husband\_thinks\_the\_baby\_is\_big\_because\_i\_didnt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/oa7nze/husband_thinks_the_baby_is_big_because_i_didnt/)

I wanted to post an update because so many people responded to my previous post, and I want to acknowledge and thank you for your helpful suggestions. 

I did as advised and checked with my MIL. She said all the babies in their family were on the large side, and my husband was over 10 pounds at birth! I, on the other hand, was on the smaller side, about 5lbs. So it's likely that the baby has his genetics. 

I also told her what he said, and she agreed to speak with him about it. She was quite upset and agreed he was being an ass.

I met up with my midwife later that day and asked if my not working out has anything to do with it because my husband said so. Her words verbatim, ""that's rubbish, that is a man speaking about things he has no idea of"" (she is British). Also, I don't have GD.

I also showed him the responses to my post, and he eventually agreed that he was being an asshole and promised he wouldn't freak out and make suggestions like that anymore. I think we're good now ( he has been supportive otherwise), and I hope this helps someone else in the same dilemma.",1422,92,2021-07-03,birth weight
BabyBumps,Just wait,"For all of you who have only heard the negative things about birth and parenthood, from a mom four months out…

Honestly, just wait. 

Just wait for that intense feeling of relief when your baby is outside of you. Whether vaginal or csection, you will have that relief. No more weight bearing down on your bladder. No more uncomfortable kick shots to various organs and bones. No more bruised ribs. Just that sweet beautiful baby entering the world for the first time, for you to carry in your arms instead of your womb. 

Just wait for their first cry. You might hold your breath in anticipation. Just wait. A calming, joyful sensation will flood your body and you will be handled that little crying creature. Such a sweet cry of life. To be calmed by your warmth. 

Just wait for them to open their eyes and start focusing on on you. Hold them close, cradled in your arms and gaze into those eyes, which are most often blue but could change over the next year! How fascinating and wonderful it is to imagine what their eyes will look like, what they are seeing with those beautiful eyes. 

Just wait for those baby sounds. Little grunts and gurgles at first. Advancing to coos and babbles. Then to squeals and screams of joy. All of them. All of those sounds will tug at your heartstrings. 

Just wait for that first smile. That first giggle. That first laugh. Oh god damn you are not prepared for that overwhelming sense of love that strikes you the moment your baby opens their tired eyes, sets their sights on you, and breaks out into pure, innocent happiness. It’s the best smile, the best laugh, you will ever witness. The way you light up their life in only the way you can. Damn. That is such a good smile. Such a good laugh. You are going to love that smile and laugh. 

Just wait for that first headlift, that first roll, that first clap, that first crawl. They are advancing and growing at just the right pace and you are so damn proud. They may get frustrated with the exhaustion that comes from working new muscles but you’re there. You’re witnessing it. You’re cheering them on. You’re giving those after-workout snuggles and kisses because they’ve worked so hard and are doing so well. 

Just wait for that personality of theirs to start forming. They are experiencing life for the first time. Everything for the first time. They are learning and growing and figuring out what works for them. What makes them happy. What makes them sad. What makes them frustrated. Will they be super playful? Super friendly? Super determined? Super curious? Super picky? “Super” because your baby takes everything to the extreme. All or nothing. This is it. You are seeing them as they are as their own person. You’ve created a person. A human. Who will grow into their own. And you get to see it happen. Love them at every stage. You’re so proud. 

Just wait. 

There are so many little things about your littles that you will love so damn much. Take photos. Record the little things, even if it’s only a few seconds. They are going to grow so fast and you are going to be so conflicted about that, but damn you’re going to love that baby. Because the hard moments are hard but the amazing moments are so much fucking better. 

Just wait.",1264,101,2021-07-04,birth weight

BabyBumps,The UK/US pregnancy difference - a note,"\*\*EDIT\*\* It seems there is a common thread of a few ways I got wrong below - as a general rule the below applies, but some things seem to vary area to area both in the UK and the US! so please read the comments :) Also - I'm not saying either way is better, I just expected lots of things to happen which didn't because they are mostly done/not done in the US so thought it was interesting! \*\*\*  


Hi all you pregnant people! When I first got pregnant, living in the UK, I searched out info for what it would be like and ended up very confused with the mix of information - especially on forums and apps - that applies to the US but NOT the UK, so I wanted to lay out the differences I've had so far for those who might be trying to sort through what will actually happen!

1. In the UK you are weighed at your first midwife appointment and then NEVER AGAIN. Because in the US you are weighed at every appointment, I thought I would be, but in the UK they don't monitor weight gain thankfully - just measure you baby either by ultrasound or tape measure to make sure it's not getting too big. Every woman puts weight on differently so this makes more sense to me!
2. In the UK, only pregnant woman who have a risk factor get the glucose test for GD. These risks include if you or an immediate family member have diabetes, if you have a high BMI (when you first got pregnant) or if you fall into an ethnic category which is more prone to GD. If you don't have these, you don't have the test AT ALL! There is also only 1 twohour test, whereas in the states there is a 1 onehour test and then a threehour test if you fail the first.
3. In the UK, it's normal to NOT get an epidural during labour, whereas in the US, it seems to be a lot more common. Midwife/community led care in the UK focus a lot more on creating a natural, home environment to give birth in, and therefore, while an epi is available to you, a lot less people take it. Gas and air is used regularly in the UK, and we seem to use more birth pools to give birth than the US (Could be wrong on that - let me know if so!) Of course, the choice is always up to you in either country, but i found this difference interesting!
4. Adding to the point above, it seems in the US, when you hit your due date they are keen to get baby out and start scheduling inductions and the like - in the UK, they wait until you are 7-10 days overdue before this is scheduled (at least this is what my midwife tells me!) unless you have a large baby or extra risk factors.
5. In the UK, obviously all your care is free under the NHS AND you get free vaccinations (flu, whooping cough, covid - currently) AND free dental care. The only things I've had to pay for is £3 for an ultrasound photo (yes you do have to pay for this if you want it printed!) and hospital parking for appointments. In the US, sounds like it depends on your insurance.
6. In the US, when you take a test, you go straight to the doctors for a blood test to confirm your pregnancy and then have multiple appointments in the first trimester to check its viable. In the UK, you see NO ONE until week 9, and even then you don't get actual confirmation of viability until week TWELVE at your scan. They just seem to take you at your word! Many people book private early scans because of this.

Has anyone else noticed other differences between the two countries which confused them when they first started researching/checking timelines? I find it very interesting!",229,293,2021-10-19,birth weight
BabyBumps,"(Final?) Update: Always trust your gut, baby stopped breathing.","A few days? weeks? ago I made an update to the post I made about my babys health issues. To put it short: doctors and midwife ignored my worries and told me she was fine until she suddenly stopped breathing.

Sadly I do not have good news. I was able to go home a few days after my last update after she did great in hospital and for the first two days at home she was fine too, except I noticed her mouth and nose area would turn slightly blue when she slept and she qas more tired than usual. I made a doctors appointment and decided to wait as she was fine otherwise.
Sadly she stopped breathing again that night, on my birthday. We called ambulance and they arrived just in time. I didnt even cry, I just felt numb and scared and exhausted. 

So we are back in hospital and she still hasent reached her birth weight as she keeps losing again. She refuses to eat and keeps falling asleep during eating, changing, etc. They looked at her heart and that was fine so there is only one thing that it could be which is something neurological. They are currently doing an MRT, I have to wait outside and hearing her scream in panic and pain whilst not being allowed in is the worst. I dont even care that everyone sees me sitting here in front of the door crying, I just want to hold my baby. 

Her cyst apparently is more of an issue than the doctor thought so they need to do a lot of invasive stuff like taking a sample from the liquid around her brain and in her spine. For days now we are running from appointment to appointment and she is getting worse and worse. She sleeps more than she did as a newborn, she is still as small as a preemie at almost a month old now. She doesnt focus her eyes or looks around. She is developing backwards it seems, getting weaker and weaker and there isnt much we can do except make sure she gets the calories, which she does now, and wait and see. 

I dont know what else to say. I am exhausted and I cant even cry anymore. I have no tears left. As much as you may judge me, she now sleeps in my bed next to me full time. I know there are risks to it (though here in germany the nurses say its fine) but I need to hear her breathing or I am not sleeping. I havent slept in 40 hours as of now. I dont feel anything except sadness for my baby. They say I have PPD but how can I not feel like this when my little angel is in so much pain. I am terrified of losing her. We will likely spend christmas here. My husband decided its too much for him to deal with and left me somewhat alone in this, I dont blame him but it hurts. I just want this nightmare to stop.

I'm sorry there is no good news. I am sorry there is nothing positive in this story so far. I just want her to be okay again.",788,86,2021-12-16,birth weight
BabyBumps,Pros and Cons: Breast vs Formula vs Pumping,"I was recently talking to a friend of mine who is expecting, and we were discussing breastfeeding vs formula feeding. I'm a recent FTM with a 9 month old LO, and I combo feed. My supply came in slow (FTM, c-section, and PCOS can all slow down supply) so we had to supplement.  And when I went back to work, I never pumped enough to compensate for what he drank during the day, so he got a bottle of expressed milk, a bottle of formula, and then nurse the rest of the time. As we were talking, we addressed some pros and cons of each. I searched the sub and couldn't find anything like that so I thought I'd share the list I came up with and open it up for others to share feedback and insights.  Let's crowdsource a post to help people make an informed decision!



Nursing 


Pros

- Provides natural antibodies and immunity booster

- easy soothing and lulling to sleep mechanism (could turn into a con later)

- Free* (assuming you have a good supply and don't invest in supplements & production boosters)

- Less to pack for outings

- No feeding prep

- it may slow down the return of aunt flo. Lol

- Some women report that it's easier to lose weight while breastfeeding. They also often report a weight spike when they stop, so tread carefully on this one. 



Cons

- potential clogged duct/mastitis

- leaking/needing nipple shields

- some pain at start (depends on the person)

- Can't feed in a moving car

- Vaginal dryness 

- Possible issues for SA survivors

- medication limitations 

- Lacking iron and other vitamins (can be easily resolved with supplements)




Formula feeding


Pros

- can resolve GI sensitivity (obviously doesn't apply to everyone)

- easier to track consumption

- lots of options (powder, pre-mixed, different sensitivities &supplements, etc)

- Easier to control flow

- Doesn't digest as fast so you can have longer windows between feeds

- No need for nursing and/or pumping bras!

- Easy to get samples and coupons



Cons

- Price

- Washing bottles

- initial dry up period can hurt (does not apply to everyone)

- delay between hunger cries and actual feeding (there are tools to help speed this up, though)

- can make baby poop smell earlier on....but honestly, just get used to it... lol



Pumping


Pros

- Easy to combine breast milk and formula if needed

- allows working moms to breastfeed

- easier to track consumption & flow (like FF)

- Still provides antibodies (like nursing)

- You have the ability to pump and feed on the go

- May still slow down the return of your cycle (Like nursing)

Cons

- Pumping can take longer than actually feeding at the breast 

- finding the right flange size and settings/cycles can be tricky 

- Washing pump parts AND bottles 

- feeding on the go probably requires ice packs and lots of prep


***Notes***

- I tried to list objective pros and cons here.  Subjectively, one major consideration is who you want to have feed the baby. When nursing, only a lactating person can feed. For some people that's a pro, for others a con. 

- Another one is bonding. My LO looks at me a lot more when bottle feeding than he does on the breast. Bonding could be a pro for any feeding style and is not exclusive to any one.

- On the flip side, a con to each of those will be judgment. There will always be someone who disagrees with your choice. They can shove it. 

- Please note that ""natural birth control"" is NOT listed as a pro for nursing or pumping. It *MAY* serve that purpose, but it is not a guarantee so please dont rely solely on that.

- And let's not forget the big pro with any of them - the baby gets fed!!!


This obviously doesn't address combo feeding, and it is far from exhaustive, but hopefully it helps as a starting point!",240,254,2021-12-11,birth weight
BabyBumps,For any other anxious preggos- my completely unremarkable birth story,"I spent so much time in the pregnant subs reading all of the exciting birth stories in anticipation of my own delivery, and they absolutely helped me, but WHOOOO did they make me fixate on all the things that could go wrong. I think people tend to share the more dramatic/complicated stories as an important way of processing, and they are also more interesting. So I want to share a boring one :)

TLDR: Kid arrives on time, 8.5 hours from start to finish, everything went exactly as expected (wanted a hospital birth with epidural.)

Baby Oliver was due on March 20, 2021. This is my first, so I expected to be induced, and had already scheduled the induction for later that week. No signs he was on the way, I was hanging out at 1cm dilated and 50% effaced for my checkups. Very occasional light cramping feelings for a couple weeks prior. Ate dates, but honestly didn't do anything to help along labor, as I was tired AF all the time and stuck to the bare minimum to survive.

I was getting ready for bed, thinking about what else I needed to do before bub arrived, and at midnight, my water broke. I was on the toilet, finished peeing, but the trickling didn't stop. It took me a minute to make sure I wasn't going crazy, but yup, water was breaking. Told husband. Cue husband freaking out. Called the hospital, took a shower, pop on a giant pad. We head out the door 40 minutes later, hospital is 20 minutes away. Contractions start, I really feel them but it's exciting and I can breathe through them.

As I sign in at the hospital to get into triage, my water ALL THE WAY breaks, I soak through my pants, shoes, everything. By the time I'm in triage, it's getting really intense and worse with each contraction. I hated the nurse who told me to stay still for the monitors- I just straight up said no, I need to move. She told me to breathe through it, I was making it worse by holding my breath. Like, I would if I could?! Uggghhh, that lady. Anyway, they check me, I'm 4cm, 100% effaced, ready to rock, just waiting for them to prep a room for me. Getting a bit delirious with the pain and I'm howling. 

I get to the room, epidural man comes in to save the day within 30 minutes. Staying still wasn't as bad as I thought, and it was a painless insertion for me. The edge came off almost instantly, and   I rolled to my side to help it circulate to my right. It was a walking epidural, so I still felt the contractions, and it got everywhere except this area around my right butt cheek but holy moly, I was actually a person instead of feeling like a cornered animal again and I felt amazing.

Resident comes in and suggests pitocin. I say no, nurse says no. How fast do you want this kid to come out? Shortly after, other resident comes in to check progress. 10cm, all systems go. She said I could take a nap and labor down before I start pushing. I still feel the contractions squeeze the heck out of my butt cheek and radiate down my leg- just the squeeze, not the pain- so I'm really grateful for the epidural. I rest for a bit. 

Shift change, new nurse comes in. We do some practice pushes. Maybe 3 sets. She calls in the cavalry- an OB I haven't met (she was lovely), a resident I haven't met, a med student. The pressure of pushing was so intense but I was so close to the finish line I just focused and put everything into it, watching the monitor to see how efficiently I was pushing. Just 20 minutes later, he bursts into the world, and I will never forget the weird feeling of him being pulled out of my body. 

 I don't remember hearing him crying, I just remember the absolute shock of how beautiful and perfect he was when they plopped him on my chest. I couldn't believe how big he looked, and that there was actually a whole baby in there the whole time. 

Oliver was born on his due date, 3/20, at 8:42am. Husband cut the cord after a few minutes. I was so out of it, I was just staring at him, and at some point they took him for his vitals- perfect APGAR, weight 7 lb 9 oz, 19 inches. Placenta came out pretty quickly and completely painlessly. Husband went to check it out and exclaimed that it looked like a dead octopus. I got a second degree tear- the stitching didn't hurt but it was WEIRD and I hated it. I was wheeled off to our very nice recovery room for the most exhausting 48 hours of our lives, and the rest is history!

The only negative part of my experience that stuck with me longer than I expected was the shitty triage nurses. They clearly didn't believe that I was in as much pain as I was, or they didn't care. Regarding the resident who suggested pitocin, it was easy enough to tell her I wasn't interested and I had my nurse to back me up.

I have to say, both delivery nurses I got were so sweet and supportive and amazing. All the excitement was so overwhelming when I was pushing I tuned everyone out except for my nurse, focused on her face and let her coach me through pushing with my contractions. Even though I hadn't met the OB before, she was fantastic. The med student was sweet. 

Now at 6 weeks out, I'm feeling like my old self, even though I still have a little extra weight and a deflated belly with an intense linea negra, but that's getting better every day. Honestly, after a couple days, just not being massively pregnant anymore felt amazing, and I was getting more restful sleep in my little naps than I got for most of my pregnancy.

Like I said at the top, I just wanted to share an example of a boring, run of the mill delivery and recovery process, because those happen too!

BabyBumps,(TW: Infant Loss) Birth Story and a PSA,"I know this isn't quite the right place, but I feel led to share in hopes that someone doesn't experience what we are going through.

Although I did not know it at the time, we believe my story starts on 9/20 at 25 weeks exactly. I woke up in the middle of the night incredibly sick. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were so severe that I actually called out of work because I couldn't sit in my home office chair without going to the bathroom every 15 minutes. This should have been my first sign to go get seen or call my doctor, but I didn't do either because I thought it was just bad Mexican food from the night before. This was my first mistake.

9/21, I felt better. I was able to eat and drink no problem, but things still weren't quite right. I had an anterior placenta, so I only ever felt baby in one place - practically kicking my cervix - and not very often. That day, however, he was moving A LOT. I couldn't get comfortable in my chair, but I was able to work. The best way to describe the feeling was his kicking and gas pains all mixed into one. I talked myself out of getting seen or calling (again) because I felt better and he was moving around. Hindsight, it was red flag #2.

Then 9/22 came. I woke up at 2am with abdominal cramps (which I now know as labor). They were bearable and occurring about 10 minutes or so apart, so I just stayed in bed and hoped that they would go away. 4:30am, they started happening closer, so I woke my husband, and we finally went to the hospital to get me checked out. By the time they got me into L&D to be checked, all hell broke loose. When the nurse came in to check me, she immediately left and returned with an army of nurses. All she could feel was baby's bag of water, so I had no chance of stopping delivery. My baby was coming at 25+2, and there was nothing they could do to stop it. 

They ended up taking him in an emergency C-section in an attempt to stabilize him for transport to a children's hospital about 45 minutes away. Between the time they checked me and the time I got put under (probably 30 min or so), my contractions were like a minute apart. I fought desperately to not push while they wheeled me to the OR. Chesley Archer was born alive at 07:08am, and fought for an hour until my husband called it. They could never get his heart rate above 40 even with multiple shots of epinephrine. I woke up around 8 when my husband came into the room and told me he didn't make it. 

My pregnancy was perfect. I had no morning sickness and no weird pregnancy urges. I was gaining weight at an appropriate rate, and Archer was growing right on target. Only issue I had was fairly consistent low back pain starting around the 22 wk mark. However, things weren't going quite to plan for baby, and it feels like the deck was stacked against him. At 12 weeks, he came back as high risk for XYY syndrome (Jacob's disease or 47,XYY), so we were sent to fetal maternal medicine to track him. We opted out of an amnio b/c in the scheme of genetic conditions, XYY usually means nothing for pregnancy, and many men don't even know they have it. Treatment plan was monthly ultrasounds until delivery just to make sure he was growing as he should, as the placenta could have been affected instead of him and that leads to preterm labor due to degradation.

Week 20 changed everything. In his anatomy scan, they found pyelectasis and a cleft lip. We were absolutely gutted. The pyelectasis was mostly a non-concern. It's relatively common, especially in boys, and had a good chance of clearing by delivery. The cleft lip diagnosis, however, rocked my world. I mourned for days following the news b/c I was so afraid of what that would mean for him and our family. I had just come to terms with how to handle it.

Week 23 we got hit again. He had a fetal echo as a precaution due to the potential genetic diagnosis, and they found a VSD (ventral septal defect of the heart). I wasn't super worried b/c there was a decent chance that it would heal on its own by delivery. 25 weekers are viable, but they have poorer outcomes in terms of delays and potential long term health effects. Adding the VSD to the mix probably just made his mountain too high to climb.

I write all of this to take the opportunity for a PSA. If something doesn't seem right, GO GET CHECKED OR CALL YOUR DOC. I talked myself out of getting seen on 9/20 for two reasons: Money (USA here) and COVID (even though I am fully vaxxed, I didn't want to risk being in the ER with COVID patients). I was not clued into the signs of preterm labor b/c I wasn't having any problems with the pregnancy. In case you haven't been told, here are some signs that require IMMEDIATE ATTENTION if you experience them:

* Preterm labor
   * contractions -more than 4 in an hour
   * menstrual-like cramps: may come and go or be constant
   * abdominal cramps: with or without diarrhea
   * low backache: comes and goes or constant
   * pelvic pressure: feels like baby is pushing down
   * Change in vaginal discharge: sudden increase in amount or change in consistency to mucus-like or blood tinged
* Vaginal bleeding
   * bright red blood is not normal: note the amount or presence of clots
* Abdominal pain
* Any change in normal fetal movement for your baby- increase or decrease
* Fever (more than 100.4F)
* Headache
   * unusually severe, seeing spots or flashing lights, or other neuro signs such as loss of balance or numbness
* Urinary Discomfort
   * frequency with small amounts
   * painful, blood-tinged, or pus in urine

Even though I know it is not my fault, I will forever live with the regret of not getting seen sooner. Hindsight is always 20/20.",669,105,2021-10-03,birth weight
BabyBumps,"LONG: Unplanned baby, but loved and wanted. Now instead of the gender disappointment I was planning to deal with we are planning to say goodbye. TW: Termination FMR NHS UK","Two weeks ago I was a little excited to finally have my 20 week scan.  SO could finally see baby and I felt like it was going to be time to tell our eldest and other people we had been keeping it from.  I was a little worried because I had a feeling this would be boy number 3 and I had small hopes to finally re-balance our household.  This was a surprise baby; we were planned to be done given two c-sections, age (37 now) and my last pregnancy was hard on me.  But when it happened we decided to push on and welcome another child.  Things were relatively good.  I didn't feel pregnant half the time.  12 week scan was fine, no immediate red flags.  I did have a episode of biliary colic the next day and got checked out to be diagnosed with gallstones.  After conferring with a surgeon it became clear I would just have to maintain a low fat diet and they would operate after baby was born.  Other than that things seemed hunky dory, just exhausting being pregnant with two kids, one just turned 1.  

The sonographer seemed preoccupied while doing the scan.  She asked if we wanted to know the sex and I turned to my SO and checked he didn't want to have a surprise for the last go around.  He confirmed he wanted to know and the sonographer said as almost a throwaway comment ""yeah, looks like a boy"" while looking intently at another part of his anatomy.  That was my first red flag.  After a little bit more looking at the heart, flashing up different colour views of blood flow, she told us it was a new machine and she was still getting used to the positioning of the buttons.  Not sure how true this was or whether she wanted to say something to reassure us because she was taking a long time trying to get a good view of the heart.  After a while she said she had some bad news.  She explained that she had seen a couple of concerning patterns in the examination of the baby.  She showed us his heart and explained that the valves should make a seagull shape rather than look flat.  She then showed us his stomach and intestines and said there was a ""double bubble"" which means there is likely a problem with the development of intestines and then finally she said the one she couldn't be 100% of was a possibility of a cleft lip.  Some views looked normal but there were others where there was a shadow.  She went away to consult with a OB-GYN for agreement before she came back to talk through what would happen next.  Meanwhile my SO and I, probably in shock, had a bit of a nervous giggle.  She came back and explained we were being referred to a fetal medicine unit (FMU) for more thorough scans of the entire baby.  She said they would take independent measurements and look at the whole thing from scratch.  She then also said the words most people dread to hear which was the combination of more than one issue usually suggests a genetic problem so we should consider if that is something we want to investigate.  On the other side she made it sound like surgery on a newborn was a piece of cake and in all likelihood these conditions were easily correctable.  

We were a bit stunned.  Not telling our 4 year old he is going to be a big brother then.  Not saying anything to most people.  I had a meeting already booked with my line manager (whom I hadn't told I was pregnant yet) where I had to explain in the same breath I was pregnant but we were having to have more scans as there could be some issues.  I told three close friends whom I had told we were going for a scan that there were complications and we were having more scans.  

And then I waited for a call from the FMU to set the appointment.  The next day they said they would see me first thing in two days time.  The wait felt like an age.  That said we were still blissfully ignorant of exactly how serious it all was and I avoided Dr Google so I didn't upset myself.  

Friday came, we went to the scan.  The fetal cardiology scan was first.  They asked me if I minded if a trainee was allowed to carry out the initial part of the scan.  I am always happy for people to learn and to help out.  However there were also 2 consultants and an additional junior doctor so, in total 4 doctors crowded round the monitor, sometimes blocking the view of the screen on the wall.  I felt very frustrated by the end of it, especially there was lots of muttering (which as someone who is hard of hearing and with everyone wearing masks it was just impossible to judge whether it was a good or a bad sign).  Eventually one of the consultant say ""That's what I was hoping to see..."" to which my SO thought was a positive sign.  

By the end of the scan I was feeling quite sore.  They pressed along my scar from my previous c-sections and were pressing hard because of my weight.  What was more distressing was this was just the first scan.  They took us into a side room to explain what their findings were.  The consultant drew a ""normal"" heart (all of which I remembered from my secondary school days) and then he drew what was going on with our baby's heart.  He diagnosed a complete balanced AVSD (atrioventricular septal defect).  He said part of the valves were missing and there was a hole in the lower section and likely (although they didn't see to confirm) in the upper section.  He then explained it is commonly associated with Trisomy 21 and while there are ""good"" outcomes for surgery which usually happens around 3-6 months it depends on what else is going on as well.  He left us to take in the information and said they would come for us to do the second scan shortly.  

Second scan was a bit less brutal and quieter in terms of personnel.  That said the monitor on the wall was angled in such a way that all I could see was a blur so I felt like I was just lying there with everyone knowing what was going on but me.  The consultant took all the necessary measurements, saw the ""double bubble"" and confirmed it was duodenal atresia.  She couldn't confirm the cleft lip.  She decided it was a shadow from something else but got another consultant to check for a second opinion.  While she left the room to fetch the other consultant they left us in the room with the image of the baby's face on the screen.  

Once she confirmed the duodenal atresia we asked questions about what that meant but overall everyone kept saying unless we understood the genetic issues they couldn't give us a meaningful plan or prognosis.  

We talked with a midwife, after holding each other and crying (mostly me), and decided we should probably have an amnio for a quick and definitive diagnosis and should we decide not to continue with the pregnancy we needed a diagnosis soon.  They gave us the weekend to be sure we wanted one, especially as they wouldn't be able to send it for analysis until the following week anyway.  

The amnio came on a Wednesday.  We rushed from dropping the kids at school and nursery up to the hospital and then waited in the waiting room anxiously.  The midwife explained that we would have a scan and double check things and then they would perform the amnio.  However the scan bit was very short.  The consultant checked his heartbeat and then realised that the conditions were good so moved quickly to perform it before baby moved and made it more risky.  In order to take my mind off things they asked us about a holiday we had been on and ended up talking for 5 minutes about ice cream flavours.  The whole time I kept my eyes shut and wiggled my toes (someone recommended it on here and if anything it gave me something else to focus on).  I didn't feel too much pain, just a bit achy afterwards and I spent the afternoon on the sofa playing computer games.   2-3 working days to get the results so I felt that probably we were looking at not hearing anything until Monday 

Thursday 6pm my phone starts ringing while we are getting the children ready for bed.  The midwife didn't want to make us wait any longer than necessary and the results had just come through.  Positive for T21.  It just felt like a perfect storm where nothing was going in a more positive direction.  It seemed every conversation or journal article I read uncovered another possibility of something being worse.  

I tried to look for positive outcomes with all three conditions.  I trawled through down syndrome groups, message boards and journal articles and it was very slim pickings.  Any sign of both conditions either had a sad ending or the heart issue was less complicated.  Some reported the heart diagnosis improving over time but they didn't have the associated bowel issues.  We had some tough conversations but really didn't feel like the doctors had given us the full picture.  

The midwife tried to arrange some more people to talk to.  A pediatric cardiac nurse and a down syndrome specialist nurse.  While writing this today we spoke with the cardiac nurse and very quickly she said it was clear that we needed to talk to a consultant as what we wanted to know was more involved than she could give us.  She answered some questions around feeding (possible need for a gastric tube long term), time in hospital, medication and the important one- could the picture improve between now and birth with the heart.  No.  The nature of the AVSD, the common valve and the hole is just not going to improve.  

The midwife phoned to say she would arrange for one of the consultants to ring who has experience in multiple areas.  As soon as I put the phone down to her he rang.  He was frank and clear about everything.  I finally felt like someone was tying up all the loose ends and putting the jigsaw puzzle together (if you can excuse this rather mixed metaphor!).  He explained the likely plan.  He agreed the cardiac problem was unlikely to show any improvement and also that with Downs syndrome in the mix other issues might manifest themselves over the third trimester.  He explained the plan would be to treat the duodenal atresia surgically first, which would mean likely 2 weeks in hospital, maybe longer if there are complications.  The baby would then need to be at 2-3kg in order to be strong enough for heart surgery.  If there are other heart complications then it might be the heart surgery comes first.  This is then further complicated by if the duodenal atresia causes polyhydramnios and therefore there is a pre-term birth.  Add to that a 60 times higher chance of stillbirth.  He didn't suggest it was impossible but the picture he painted was clear.  

I am not afraid of cognitive deficits or even so much that my child would likely never leave home.  I have an autistic brother who I love and fully expect to have some hand in his care long term.  I don't however want to bring a child into this world to be drugged up and operated on and that to be the sum total of his existence.  I don't want to tell my children they are getting a baby brother but he is probably going to be very poorly or worse have to tell them he died before he was even born.  I don't want to miss out on the next year of their achievements and their life so wrapped up in getting to the next surgery or living in the hospital.  I have immense respect for the people who have taken on that challenge and if this were our first baby and I were 10 years younger I would probably face the challenge head on and take the risk of that heartbreak because it would be all on me.  

Now every morning I am waking, hoping that he doesn't move because every kick brings tears.  I want the decision taken out of my hands because its already so painful to bear.  I have no idea how to tell my family, some of whom didn't even know I was pregnant.  Likely we will lie and say it was a miscarriage just to make it easier for them to hear.  

I hope this story will help someone else down the line.  It's helped me to document it even if no one reads it.

Edit:  Just to say thank-you to those who have read and commented.  I appreciate your kind words and shared experiences.  It is a lonely road as no one else can make this decision for us.  We spoke with the Midwife about half an hour ago and asked her to start the process for TFMR.

Edit 2:  Thank-you again to everyone who has commented.  I appreciate the words of support.  I have tried to take time to reply to everyone regardless of their perspective because I really do value people sharing their stories and because someone in the future might also find value in them.  

I wanted to add on here (in case someone sees this post in the future but doesn't want to read all the comments) that I have had the subreddit r/tfmr_support recommended to me.  Already just scrolling through I can see it will be a supportive and helpful place just as r/Babybumps has always been.  

Also anyone in a similar situation in the UK there is an independent charity ARC (Antenatal results and choices) which has information for all choices people may make.  They push no agenda and they support people no matter what route they ultimately take.  I got lots of information there and will likely make use of some of their contacts and counselling.

Edit 3:  As there are still some people coming across this post I just wanted to add baby Oliver was born sleeping at 8.03am, 14th December 2020.  It was an intense but short labour.  It seems that my placenta was already failing (they described its condition as gritty) suggesting that he may not have been with us for much longer anyway.  He looked so tiny and frail but we were able to say goodbye.  Everyone took such excellent care of us and there are more opportunities for support coming.  We haven't decided whether to go down a burial, cremation or memorial route yet but thankfully there is no rush for us to decide yet.",559,117,2020-12-08,birth weight
BabyBumps,A PSA from a L&D RN to anyone who might need to hear this ❤️,"A disclaimer: I’m not a lurker, I’m also on this journey (for the 4th time!) with y’all! 

On to my message:

I’ve been so thankful to have these groups to keep me entertained, celebrate, commiserate (GD!), and learn about new things! One thing that I keep seeing pop up is about moms not wanting to impose on the nurses during labor, feeling embarrassed about things that happen during labor/pp, or worrying about expressing their desires during the hospitalization. 

I’m here to speak for majority of L&D RNs when I say - WE LOVE OUR JOBS!! We know that with labor and childbirth comes strong emotions, family dynamics, throw up, blood, poop, sweat, and other fluids. And that’s okay! Cause we also know that as part of our job description, we get to be there when little babies come into the world and take their very first breath, when women get to witness just how amazing their own body is to have created a perfect little person, and see their own strength to have gone thru childbirth- whether vaginally or via major surgery. I mean- come on! does it get any better than that?!

We as women often have such complex relationships with our body images, for one reason or another. And to be present when a fellow woman has the opportunity to see that we are made for this... well that is just another perk of the job. 

I know that some of you may have seen us when we are not at our best and I’m sorry about that. We are just people too. We may have walked in the door and been rushed back to the OR to take over a crash c-section, had to support a family who lost their baby, you may be the third delivery of our shift, we may have not sat down for a proper meal for 12 hours, or shifts go by when we’ve literally started the day with a cup of coffee on the drive in and not had a sip of anything for the duration of the shift. So if you see us at that moment, we try not to show it but sometimes, it’s hard not to carry that weight from patient to patient. It doesn’t mean we don’t love our job, it just means we are flawed like everyone else. We love what we do!

So if you are worried about bothering us cause you are nauseous or throwing up, if you feel bad about pooping when you push, if you are nervous about holding it together on our account, I’m here to say: don’t! We have seen it all, cleaned it all, endured a lot, and yet we still *love* what we do! 

I hope this message finds anyone out there who needed to hear this. We are so excited to be a part of your labor and delivery experience!

A L&D RN",1088,61,2020-08-29,birth weight
BabyBumps,"UPDATE: Always trust your gut, baby stopped breathing","A few days ago I posted about my baby who stopped breathing after multiple doctors told me she was fine. Today I finally want to post an update. Trigger warning as I will be discussing medical problems

We are still in the hospital and will likely stay for a couple more days or weeks, really hard to say at the moment. After the first day her oxygen levels were still kind of bad so they kept her on a monitor for a while but at least she is breathing on her own again!!

They found a black mass in the left side of her brain and apparently it's a cyst which isn't too uncommon in newborns and usually goes away on it's own with no issues, however it will be kept a close eye on to make sure it doesn't cause any problems. 

Sadly we still do not know what seems to be the problem with my little baby girl. She still isn't eating and now considered underdeveloped for her age. She actually just turned 2 weeks today but still looks like a few days old baby since she is so small an underweight. The doctor prepared me that she will probably have development delays later in her life due to the rapid weightloss and malnurishment now. 
She gets fed every two hours, first I try nursing then give her my pumped milk per bottle or some formula. 
Her throwing up is becoming better. She is on three different medications that finally seem to work. Whenever she throws up, she gets difficulty breathing and they arent sure why (they think she is simply too weak to breathe properly) so she still has monitors and all. Funnily enough she also has a funghi infection in her throat, which I have been suggesting she had since day 4 of her life but was dismissed. Its now so bad that it's in her whole body and she is on heavy medication for that too.

Currently their guess is either a thyroid problem like her father or a digestion problem. Either way she is still losing weight. She has lost close to 20% now. She is so small and it hurts seeing her like that but the doctors are very nice and try their best. She finally gained a little bit yesterday and I am hopeful for today. However we are not allowed to leave until she is back at her birth weight and she has no breathing issues for 24 hours. 

Also I want to thank everyone for all their well wishes and messages and advice. I stopped answering after a while but trust me I read every comment. And it helped so much knowinhmg I have people thinking about my baby and having a place to talk about it. This Was the scariest day of my life and something I wish on noone. 
Also my advice still stand, trust your gut. Wether you are a first time mom or already have kids. You usually know whats best for your baby and nobody knows our littles like we do. Always trust yourself and get it checked out. 

Thank you. I might update once we leave the hospital. Its very straining here.",609,71,2021-12-07,birth weight
BabyBumps,Weight Shaming?!,"Long story short I’m 26 w 1 d. Last month my midwife  told me I’ve gained 21 lb total. For context I’m 5’11 almost 6 feet and my weight as of last appointment was 220 lb. I’m feeling EXTREMELY self conscious about they number and the fact that the midwife brings it up in a really cold callus way every single time I go to an appointment. I work from home and unfortunately sedentary most of the day besides cleaning, walking my dogs etc. I try to eat “healthy” but not going to lie do indulge in carbs and sweets when I am craving it. At this point the last appointment said I’m “hurting my baby” or going to give birth to a very large child which could be hard. 

My question to all of you is, am I alone in this? Has anyone else experienced this? Am I hurting my baby? I mean I look like I’ve gained weight but I’m by no means obese looking just; thicker. Any advice or encouraging comments would be so appreciated.

BabyBumps,Am I Being Unreasonable?,"I suppose I should provide some context to the predicament at hand so people understand the reason why I am being “unreasonable”... 

So, my brother and his fiancé had been trying to get pregnant for going on 2 years when they announced that they were 12 weeks pregnant at the beginning of May, earlier this year. I, myself, had recently found out that I was pregnant too but had only told my boyfriend and my mum — a complete accident, but a happy and welcomed one nevertheless. I had no intentions of announcing anything until I had hit a similar mark in my pregnancy, however my mum let the secret slip during a family event and my soon to be sister in law found out. Off the bat, she was incredibly rude and made snide comments towards mine and my boyfriend’s situation, insinuating that our relationship wasn’t serious enough for a child because there wasn’t a ring on my finger.

This attitude has continued throughout my pregnancy. Anything that I bought for my baby, she bought two of. If it cost me £500, she bought one for £1000. This only worsened when we found out that we were both having girls. If I bought one outfit, she bought two. If I bought a pink dress, she bought one with frills, sequins and everything else. There is a lot of animosity towards me and whenever my baby was the topic of conversation, she would either shut the conversation down and talk about her own baby or make a huge drama and leave the room. For this reason, I kept my baby name a secret — well tried to. I had a bundle of personalised things sent to my mum’s address as I knew she would be in to collect the parcel... I forgot, opened the package wondering what it was whilst my brother’s fiancé was there and there was my baby name — Delilah Isabella [my boyfriend’s last name] — in big, pink, cursive letters on the blanket. She saw. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks later to the beginning of November, and I got the text to say that my sister in law had gone into labour. Several days later, the obligatory facebook announcement was made that their little Delilah Isabella had been born with the time and weight, all the usual stuff. I was and still am very livid. Me and my boyfriend spent hours, days, weeks searching through names to come up with that name for her to steal it. I know for a fact that neither of those names were on her and my brother’s list of potential names, as I had seen it just days before she went into labour. Popular or not, they were not on her radar. 

I am very much furious. I have cried, I have yelled and I have screamed at anyone and whoever. This was the one name that I liked — loved. I hated any other name, any other name combination and she knew how much I struggled to come up with a name. I have taken this as a a personal and malicious attack, due to her jealousy and bitterness. This was no accident or coincidence, it was very much intentional and meant to purposely upset me. 

My step dad came up with the solution that we change the name from Delilah to Lilah and mix up the spelling to Lyla. I hated it — despised it — however, my boyfriend seemed to go for it. As I was considering this, the nickname Lilah suddenly appeared for the new baby — once again ruining any hope for my baby having a name. Again, I am furious and positive this was another malicious attempt to ruin my pregnancy. 

Other than the fact that my back is in absolute agony sustaining the weight of this baby, I couldn’t be less excited to give birth. She has ruined my experience of being pregnant from the very second she found out and has ruined the thought of actually becoming a mother, too. I am just short of two weeks away from my due date, my baby has no name and there is no list of even potential names to consider because I hate them all. My family have very much taken the stance of “just pick a new name” despite already having personalised things with the name on it. At this point, I don’t want to give birth although that’s not an option. 

I refuse to see the baby. The thought of seeing her, and having to call her what my baby should be named, upsets me. I have told my brother and his fiancé that I will not see the child, nor will they be allowed to see mine, unless the name is changed. I have been told that I’m being unreasonable and tearing the family apart, even by my boyfriend, but I am very much upset about this and angry. I have spent every second of my free time searching for a new name, but just cannot find one that I don’t hate. At this rate, she will be registered as “the baby”. 

So, am I being unreasonable?",59,247,2020-12-05,birth weight
BabyBumps,"WaPo article: Mortality rate for Black babies is cut dramatically when delivered by Black doctors, researchers say","[Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/black-baby-death-rate-cut-by-black-doctors/2021/01/08/e9f0f850-238a-11eb-952e-0c475972cfc0_story.html?=)

Rachel Hardeman has dedicated her career to fighting racism and the harm it has inflicted on the health of Black Americans. As a reproductive health equity researcher, she has been especially disturbed by the disproportionately high mortality rates for Black babies.


In an effort to find some of the reasons behind the high death rates, Hardeman, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, and three other researchers combed through the records of 1.8 million Florida hospital births between 1992 and 2015 looking for clues.


They found a tantalizing statistic. Although Black newborns are three times as likely to die as White newborns, when Black babies are delivered by Black doctors, their mortality rate is cut in half.

""Strikingly, these effects appear to manifest more strongly in more complicated cases,"" the researchers wrote, ""and when hospitals deliver more Black newborns."" They found no similar relationship between White doctors and White births. Nor did they find a difference in maternal death rates when the doctor's race was the same as the patient's.


“It is the first empirical evidence to describe the impact of the physician’s race on an outcome such as infant mortality,” Hardeman says.


With 5.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, the United States has a high infant mortality rate, and Black babies are in the gravest danger, with an infant mortality rate in 2018 of 10.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to a rate of 4.6 White babies per 1,000 live births.

Infant mortality is defined as death during the first year of life, and 66 percent of those deaths, for all races, occur in the neonatal period in the first 28 days of life, with 14 percent within the first hour and another 26 percent within one to 23 hours.

Under the care of Black doctors, Black babies’ mortality rate was more than halved from 430 per 100,000 live births to 173 per 100,000, Hardeman says.


Although infant mortality in the United States has been decreasing, the gap between Black and White infants has persisted, Hardeman says. The root, she says, lies in structural racism.


She defines structural racism as the “normalization and legitimization of an array of dynamics — historical, cultural, institutional and interpersonal — that routinely advantage Whites while producing cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for people of color.”

Hardeman and the other researchers — Brad N. Greenwood, associate professor of information systems and operations management at George Mason University; Laura Huang, an associate professor at Harvard Business School; and Aaron Sojourner, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management — wrote that more research was needed to understand why Black physicians outperform their White counterparts.
They cautioned that it wasn’t practical for all Black families to seek Black doctors to deliver their babies, not only because there are too few of them but also because the reasons for the disparity in care need to be understood and addressed.


“Key open questions include the following: 1) whether physician race proxies for differences in physician practice behavior, 2) if so, which practices, and 3) what actions can be taken by policymakers, administrators, and physicians to ensure that all newborns receive optimal care,” they wrote. 

“Reducing racial disparities in newborn mortality will also require raising awareness among physicians, nurses, and hospital administrators about the prevalence of racial and ethnic disparities, their effects, furthering diversity initiatives, and revisiting organizational routines in low-performing hospitals.”

Common causes of infant mortality are premature birth, low birth weight, maternal complications and sudden infant death syndrome, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some of these deaths are caused by complications related to the mother’s health. Historically, Black maternal health has always been concerning, with Black women four to five times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than White women, regardless of income, education or lifestyle. A Black woman does not have to be poor for her life or her baby’s life to be at stake.


The most recent figures, for 2016, show 40.8 pregnancy related deaths per 100,000 live births for Black women and 12.7 per 100,000 for White women. Most pregnancy related deaths, the CDC says, are preventable.


Health disparities have been well documented in the medical literature. In 2002, the Institute of Medicine published Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care, a book-length study that concluded that: “A large body of published research reveals that racial and ethnic minorities experience a lower quality of health services, and are less likely to receive even routine medical procedures than are White Americans.”

Citing numerous examples, the authors wrote: “Significantly, these differences are associated with greater mortality among African-American patients.”
More recent studies show bias is still being documented, and that people of color have disproportionate rates of preventable death and illness than Whites.

Hardeman says that by adulthood so many disadvantages have accumulated to affect a Black woman’s health that the race of the doctor may not make a difference.


She says that, by adulthood, structural racism has already been at play, and that racial concordance is not enough to counteract the “cumulative” disadvantages that often benefit White women and lead to adverse outcomes for Black women.

“It also means the cumulative experience of racism and sexism, throughout the lifecourse, can trigger a chain of biological processes, known as weathering, that undermine Black women’s physical and mental health.”


Hardeman recognizes that most babies and mothers statistically will be cared for by White physicians, but she says that they are equally responsible for “divesting from health care inequities.”


In a report from July, she writes, “We believe that medical schools and training programs should equip every clinician, in every role, to address racism. And licensing, accreditation, and qualifying procedures should test this knowledge as an essential professional competency.”

This could look like mandating education about implicit bias and social justice, which can better prepare doctors of any race to properly treat at-risk patients, regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds or race. Medical schools have come under increasing pressure to include such education and counteract training that in the past wrongly taught doctors that there were genetic differences among different races.


And the health of babies, even before conception, can be improved by addressing the needs of Black mothers and creating programs that improve prenatal care and provide timely interventions to alter the course of the health of Black babies and their mothers, according to the National Birth Equity Collaborative.


And it remains important, Black doctors say, to increase their numbers.

“Government doesn’t have your back, neither does health care,” says Khayriyyah Chandler, a Black doctor practicing in New Jersey.
According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, only 5 percent of doctors identify as Black, and 4.9 percent of pediatricians do so. That is compared to the 579,174 Black babies born in 2018, 15 percent of all births. While medical schools are seeing a steady increase of Black students, as of 2020 they only make up 7 percent of students.
Enrollment is affected by the wealth gap of Black households, Chandler says, as well as the cost of maintaining a private practice.


“It is harder to keep a private practice, particularly based on higher percentages of Medicaid and Medicare, especially when you have more debts than your predecessors,” she says. “When there’s more debt, there tends to be less risk, and I suspect it is harder to find abundant practices, and a variety of practices, in Black neighborhoods. That is why authentic efforts must be made with Black people, and they must lead efforts in their own communities.”


Many factors play into a student’s career choice, and for a child of color, especially in low-income areas, not seeing Black professionals may make certain career choices seem unattainable. Organizations such as the Big Homie Project are hoping to bridge the gap. Founder Jacqueline Diep knows what the lack of positive influences can feel like. A child of the foster care system, she credits a teacher for changing her life’s trajectory, as she went from having a modest GPA to eventually getting an MBA and landing jobs at companies like Google.


“People helped me, success didn’t just magically happen,” she says. “And what I realized was that a lot of these kids in the community aren’t hopeless, but it’s just much harder. And I realized that I’m an example of what is possible if you just surround yourself around the right people.”


The Big Homie Project pairs professionals, including doctors, with children of color. One of the mentors, Fernandino Vilson, a resident urologist at Stanford, knows what it is like to be told you can’t succeed by those in a position to help you.


“My love for anatomy, physiology and science sparked my interest in medicine, along with being told that I wouldn’t be a doctor and to choose another route,” he says. High school guidance counselors and career advisers discouraged him, he says, but instead of changing course, he was determined to prove them wrong. His mentoring includes his two young brothers, who are now pursuing medicine.
Vilson says that, throughout his journey, mentorship has always been on his mind and he began acting on it in medical school: “We’ve put on premed conferences inviting underrepresented minorities in North Carolina. We’d give mock interviews, put them in front of recruiters for med schools. The Big Homie Project is a way for me to continue.”


While creating channels for more Black doctors is a major step for survival of Black infants, Hardeman says, change is needed throughout the health-care system.


Organizations such as the National Birth Equity Collaborative are advocating for more research into the health concerns of Black families as well as for governmental agencies to provide more resources to address health disparities.


Hardeman and the other three researchers put it this way:
“We hope this study provides a basis for additional work that advances our understanding of inequality, its origins and how practitioners can work toward creating better and more-equitable birth outcomes.”",646,57,2021-01-12,birth weight
BabyBumps,I feel more confident and beautiful in my pregnant body that I have in years! I am sad about that going away at birth.,"Hello! This is my first pregnancy and I am having a relatively very easy time, all things considered! I was 210lb at 5’3” at the beginning of pregnancy and have been plus size for the majority of my adult life. Because I am a thicker big chested lady I did not show my pregnancy for a long while. I finally started to really show around the 20-23 week mark. Around this time I started to dress in a way that was both comfortable and that would show off my baby bump. It was the first time in my life where my growing stomach was something to be celebrated. I suddenly feel this body confidence that I never had before! I am proud of my body and have loved wearing clothes that flatter me and help show how far along I am. I have not gained too much weight in pregnancy but I do suddenly have hips for the first time. 

I am so nervous for my postpartum body. My tummy fat never left, it has just shifted around my baby. I am afraid that once baby is out into the world this new body confidence I have acquired will evaporate. My body feels justified because there is a baby growing, what happens when there is no more baby and my stomach is looser and thicker than ever before? 

Thank for letting me vent. Anyone else feel this way before? Existing moms how do you celebrate your postpartum bodies?

Update: Thank you are for sharing your stories and feelings! It’s fantastic to know that others feel/ have felt this way before.",495,68,2021-04-01,birth weight
BabyBumps,My Holy Grail of Baby Prep Info for you!,"This subreddit was tremendously helpful as I prepped for my baby, so I have taken everything I've learned over the last 4 months and typed it all up for you.
It might be scary, exciting, and definitely overwhelming to welcome a new human into your home. The following suggestions are based on my experience alone, and you almost certainly will have different needs based on the circumstances of your life. 
I personally wanted to have everything purchased for my baby before her birth because I knew there would be plenty we couldn’t prepare for. This really set us up for success, or in the least, it probably prevented a nervous breakdown. There were so many unanticipated difficulties in the first few weeks of my baby’s life, and being prepared meant we could focus all of our energy on those immediate needs and not on shopping for basics. With that said, hope this helps!


Items you will want purchased and ready before your baby comes home. 

°Carseat. I ended up buying the Chicco Keyfit 30. Reliable, safe, and won’t break the bank. Can be made compatible with many strollers. Was considering the uppababy Mesa, but people said it was heavy and the price was a bit high. 

°Bottles. Make sure you have a few sterilized and ready to go. Plan on breastfeeding? Still have bottles on hand, you may need them sooner than you think. Every lactation consultant I met with recommended the narrow neck Dr. Brown's anti colic bottles with the Preemie nipples. We still use them, and they are a little leaky, but work great for my baby. BTW don’t throw out the little round plastic disks that come with them, they are meant to keep the milk in the bottle when you travel (I didn’t realize and tossed them, but bought travel lids on amazon).

°Formula. Sign up for some free formula samples from similac or enfamil. Baby’s third night of life is HELL - they will either cluster feed to bring in your milk, or just scream all night and starve themselves like my baby did. You could also get a small pack of “ready to feed” formula, which is already constituted and just needs a disposable nipple added. 

°Bassinet. I bought the arm's reach clear vue, and really liked that I didn’t have to bend over much and it is a very safe bassinet. Price was a bit higher than I would have liked. Obviously I wish I had the snoo, but I couldn’t justify buying one. We moved my baby to her crib around 2-3 months old, so it’s not like you’re going to be married to your bassinet choice. My baby was a very loud sleeper as a newborn, lots of grunting, so moving her to her crib in her own room was the best way for all of us to get some sleep. It is recommended to keep them in your room until 6 months old, but it is not the end of the world if you need to move them out sooner. 

°Pump. Have your pump up and ready. Do your best to understand the settings. I got the Spectra S1 which is “portable” and it is really wonderful to not be stuck on the wall. I found a retailer who would cover this model under my insurance, but most others would only cover the S2. Also I bought some Philips Avent bottles which are compatible with the spectra. If you get a pump, you will need a pumping bra. The pump’s suction is not strong enough to hold the flanges to your breasts, so unless you want to sit there for 15 minutes holding them in place, you will need a pumping bra to hold the flanges to your body.

°Baby clothes. I’ve seen much debate online about if you should skip buying newborn clothes and only buy 0-3. My baby was born at 7 lbs 14 oz, and then lost weight and was very slow to gain weight. She was in her newborn clothing for 6 weeks! She is a very skinny and long baby, so I am glad I bought enough newborn clothing for her until she was ready for 0-3. I suggest spending the extra $20-$30 on newborn clothing - pajamas, onesies, and pants - because if you do need it, you’ll be glad you have it. You should also have 0-3 size clothing washed and ready in case you have a larger than expected baby! If you want, you can just start off with a lot of zip up pajamas. It's a bit easier than coordinating onesies with pants. I bought an assortment of Carter's pajamas and Target pajamas. Having at least 9 pairs of pajamas in each size is a good amount so you don't have to do laundry too often. 

°Diapers. The newborn stage is a great time to test out different diaper brands because people tend to give diapers as gifts. I didn’t like the Honest brand - too leaky. My hospital sent us home with Huggies which I like and use. I bought some Huggies when they were on sale at Costco, and I also use the Costco Kirkland brand of diapers because they’re cheaper. Another great purchase is the Costco Kirkland wipes. PS: Costco has online delivery and will send these straight to your front door. 

°Changing pad. I have friends who said they’d change their newborn on their bed over a portable cloth changing pad, but I always changed her in her nursery on her changing table. I love the skip hop changing pad which is made of foam and wipes clean. Amazing and worth the money. Sometimes she “floods” her changing pad and we can just wipe it clean and then use lysol spray to sterilize it. 

°Diaper Pail. I wanted the Ubbi Diaper Pail, and someone on Facebook was giving theirs away for free! I like that it can hold any bag and doesn’t require Ubbi’s brand of bags. 

°Sound Machine. Your baby just spent 9 months in a dark, loud environment. The loud white noise helps soothe them, and you will want a sound machine for all naps and sleep. I bought the Hatch sound machine because that seemed to be highly rated. It’s neat because it has an app where you can manage the settings like light, sound, and volume. It’s fab. 

°Swaddles. Babies are uncoordinated little creatures and will kick, thrash, and wiggle during their sleep. My little one was a real kicker, and could break out of the cloth swaddles we used at the hospital. The velcro swaddles worked great for her, and I even fed her while swaddled because she ate well while being contained. You’ll want more than you think, 6 is a good start, because your baby will get those swaddles dirty. I also bought cloth swaddles from Aden and Anais, and Husdon. Even if you don’t use them for swaddling, they can keep the baby warm in their carseat. 

°Burp Cloths. To be honest, it doesn’t really matter what brand or type you get. You just need something soft to catch any spit up, vomit, or drool - and get enough of them because they will need to be laundered quickly. I also bought receiving blankets, and still really don’t understand their purpose, so feel free to skip purchasing those. 

°Baby Towels + Shampoo. Our hospital did not give our baby a bath, so we got home and eventually realized she smelled really bad. You’ll want some baby sized towels (they usually have a little hood on them), which are soft and gentle on your baby’s skin. We use the Cetaphil baby shampoo, and it is great! 

°Nail Clipper. I bought an electric baby nail filer and it was perfect for the baby’s first few weeks when I was too scared to use an actual nail clipper or scissor. I really like the Frida nail scissors, and exclusively use that to trim her nails now. I like to do it either while she’s eating, or right afterward. 



There are a number of items you do not need to purchase before the baby is born, but you will likely want to buy at some point. 


°Stroller. This is a heated one. Everyone has their own opinions on strollers. I live in a city and mostly drive, but our sidewalks are bumpy and not well paved. I chose to buy the Uppababy Cruz. Friends who bought the Vista love it, but said it is not a good double stroller because it’s too heavy to push. Knowing that, I chose the cheaper and lighter option - the Cruz - and bought a used bassinet insert on facebook marketplace for $30. I also bought the Chicco Keyfit Caddy stroller that is compatible with her carseat. You are not supposed to leave a baby in their carseat outside of the car - I am a medical professional, I know this, and prior to giving birth I thought I wouldn’t do this. But now that I have a real baby, the thought of waking her to transfer her to her Uppababy stroller doesn’t sit well with me. So, if I am running into the pediatrician office or to the grocery store, I pop the carseat on the Caddy and am on my way. If you do this, the baby must be strapped in properly into her carseat to avoid positional asphyxiation. I just took my first flight with the baby and kept her in her carseat+caddy through the airport, then checked the Caddy stroller at the gate. It worked perfectly! 

°Crib. I bought a beautiful Pottery Barn crib on craigslist for $200. They also gave me a lightly used mattress. Score! I’m still proud of this purchase. You’ll also need sheets for your crib, bassinet and pack ‘n play if you buy one. 

°Rocking chair. My dad gifted me a la-z-boy recliner, and it is amazing. I got one with material that is easy to clean, and it rocks and reclines. We purchased it while I was still early in my pregnancy, so I was able to enjoy it throughout my whole pregnancy and beyond. Babies love repetitive movement, so you will spend lots of time rocking your newborn. 

°Baby Container. It’s a funny term, but it basically refers to anywhere you can safely place your baby so you can still do things like go to the bathroom, or shower. Could be a pack ‘n play, a swing, or a bouncy chair. Someone gave me their swing, and it turns out my baby LOVES movement. She took many supervised naps in her swing when she was a newborn. I also bought a used Baby Bjorn bouncer chair on Facebook Marketplace and we use it every day - it’s very pricey when brand new, and even used, but a great product. We also have a now recalled Boppy Lounger. It was a nice product to have because I could prop my baby up on it while giving her a bottle to help with her reflux, or for her to chill next to me on my bed. The recall makes sense, any sort of pillow is inherently unsafe, even the dock-a-tot. But I’m not too heartbroken because my dog loves to sleep on the Boppy, so at least it’s not a waste. 

°Audio &/or Video Monitor. Once you move your baby to their own room, you need a reliable way to make sure you can hear them. Video monitors really are not necessary, but we got the very affordable Wyze camera which runs on wifi. It has an app so I can open my phone to check on her when she’s in her crib. For audio, we got the Vtech monitor with two receivers, so my husband and I can both listen for her from different rooms. I have no complaints, it’s a great audio monitor. 

°Baby Carrier. When your baby is a newborn, they will love the warmth and comfort of being held against you. It’s great to have a carrier to wear your baby in during witching hour, when they just scream for no reason. I bought a used Baby Bjorn heavy duty carrier on facebook Marketplace, and it’s good for an older baby. But for a newborn, I recommend trying out a wrap or a sling carrier. The first time I saw someone put on a wrap, I thought it was for sure too complicated for me to replicate. I wanted to test it out, and bought the Solly Wrap used from someone on facebook. People recommended the Solly because the fabric is soft and not too hot for the baby. After watching a youtube video on how to wrap it, it was no big deal! Even my husband figured out how to wrap it. If you can borrow one from a friend or buy one used, I recommend trying a wrap and seeing if your baby enjoys it. 

°Bottle Rack and Brush. At some point you will probably introduce a bottle, and then need to clean it. I did not find that any particular brush is better than others, any generic one will do. I like the boon drying rack we have because it is large, but I also don’t think the brand of drying rack is too significant. 

°Dish soap and Detergent. I am not certain whether or not it’s actually necessary to buy baby specific dish soap and detergent, but I like them because they are very gentle. 
Baby Bath. You don’t actually need a baby specific bathtub, but I bought a few different types for next to nothing on facebook marketplace. This one is totally up to you! You may also want some baby wash cloths to wipe down your baby’s body with warm soapy water. 

°Car mirror and window shade. Get yourself a mirror so you can see your baby in the car while you’re driving. And you may also want to put a shade on your car window so the sun is not directly on your baby’s face. 

°Thermometer and baby tylenol. You can use your adult thermometer on your baby, but I am glad to have an exclusive baby one that I keep in the nursery. You may also want to buy infant tylenol to give after their first set of shots. 

°Aquaphor. Diaper rash? Put on aquaphor. Just gave out of the bath? Lather that baby up with Aquaphor. Scratched her face with her razor sharp talons? Aquaphor. 

°Lunch box and ice packs. Eventually you’ll need to leave the house, and it’s nice to have a designated lunch box and ice packs for their milk that you can throw in the diaper bag or bring solo. 

°Play mat. You can really just stick your baby on your carpet or a blanket for tummy time, but having a playmat with toys and lights is a great plus! I got the fisher price piano kick mat. 

°Nursing Pillows. I tried both the Boppy pillow and My Breast Friend pillow, and honestly had no preference. The Boppy is a softer plush material and is the same shape all around, and the My Breast Friend is very firm with two head supports for the baby. Jokes on me, because my baby decided she didn’t want to nurse after 6 weeks, so those pillows are now gathering dust in her closet. And that’s how combo feeding life (pumped milk and formula) chose me. 

°Pitcher. I’m obsessed with the most simple little creation - the Dr. Brown’s mixing pitcher. In the morning, we use the pitcher to make all the formula we will use over the next 24 hours. It saves so much time when your baby is screaming for their next meal. 

°Pacifiers. Oh, I wish my baby would take a pacifier. We tried out lots of different types, and every medical professional suggested the Philips Soothie pacifier. However, just like with nursing, my baby decided the pacifier wasn’t her thing. Maybe yours will take to it!

°Diaper bag and portable changing pad. You do not actually need a diaper bag, but you’ll realize that every time you leave the house with your baby you will need diapers, wipes, a change of clothes, milk, and a burp cloth. You’ll probably forget something, but you can minimize that risk by keeping everything in a designated diaper bag. You’ll also want a portable changing pad, or even doggy pee pads that you can easily toss after using. I keep doggy poop bags in my diaper bag because most doctors' offices won’t allow you to toss a dirty diaper in their trash can.

BabyBumps,I’m 34 weeks pregnant and my mother is grossed out by my “fat” body.,"My mom is obsessed with being skinny. I’m quarantined with her. It’s hell. I had trouble standing up from lying flat on the tile floor after stretching and she calls me a fat pig. No she’s not being funny. Called me fatty when I was just sitting on the couch on my phone. 

I’m fucking pregnant. I’m over 34 weeks pregnant. I should have this belly. And I’m really proud of it. I’m not insecure about my weight. Yes, I do want to lose this extra weight as soon as I can after birth, but I’m okay with how I look. 

The whole point of this post is to rant I guess because it’s so fucking annoying. Just being around someone who sighs whenever they see you eat is fucking obnoxious. Now every time I look at her I know she thinks I’m ugly. I feel it. And I literally can’t do anything about it. I’m staying here until the baby can get some vaccinations and then my husband and I are moving out of state. I’m also having a really hard time figuring out when’s the safest time for us to move because of this, you know, global pandemic thing going on. I don’t even know how to handle this.

BabyBumps,"Graduated 9/22/21! 37+4, positive “slight” induction, special delivery with a surprise twist!","Super positive and super fast! I’m a third time mama, so we expected to be a tad early and have a relatively quick delivery. Both other deliveries were uncomplicated,
8 and 7 hours respectively. I’ve been very blessed in my births, and am very grateful, and know that others have gone through such tough labors and post partum healing. You mama’s rock, and my heart goes out to you. 

At my 36 week appointment cervical check, doc asked me to guess how much I was dilated… I said “2cms?”…. He laughed and said, “try 4cms! Wouldn’t be surprised if you pop in the next couple of days!” I was *shocked*! I have an “excitable uterus”, and had been contracting for weeks, but I wasn’t expecting that. We had just purchased a house three weeks ago, and weren’t moved in yet because of all the cleaning and work that needed to happen. It was a great deal and we were able to pay cash, but a hoarder lived here. It was a whole thing getting this place ready for our family, working day and night. I had no nursery, and my bag wasn’t even packed! Needless to say, I went home and got busy! 

Thankfully little Rowan decided to hold off another week, allowing us the time to get moved and truly ready. It was like a race against the clock though! I drove myself to my appt at 37+4, pretty much expecting to go to L&D directly. I wasn’t wrong, 4.5cms with bulging membranes and strong pressure (not painful yet) contractions. Called my partner and walked over to the hospital to get checked in. 

My partner arrived an hour later, and about the same time, doc came in and gave my membranes a little poke, water breaking right away. Contractions strengthened. An hour after that, it was time for my epidural and a “tiny bit” of pitocin (according to the nurse) to help things along. Two hours later it was time to push! I pushed once, the nurse had to stop me right away to make sure the doctor arrived in time. Rowan Marie was ready to meet us! Doc came in, and prepared himself- I pushed once and they asked if our other babies had a lot of hair. I began crying from joy and anticipation of meeting my girl, then the doctor turned to my husband all of a sudden and asks him if he wants to deliver our daughter! We thought he was joking, but he wasn’t! Hubs said he wasn’t going to miss the opportunity of a lifetime, and the nurses freaked and ran about getting him some sterile gloves. This all happened in a minute or two, and I was ready for another push. Doc stood behind my husband, front and center, and told him how to let my body do the work, and just gently hold and guide her out of me. One more push, and she was here, my husband being the very first person to hold our daughter, and the very first person she saw in the world. It was an experience unlike anything else, for both my husband and me. I felt so bonded with him in that moment, absolutely impressed at his willingness to be right there at the “business end” of things. We learned that this was not the norm and the nurses had never seen a doctor make this offer before. 

I was able to clamp the cord myself, and even snapped a couple of pictures (still in stirrups) as my husband cut it. A nurse grabbed the phone and got a few more special shots of our family as placenta was delivered. Surprisingly, she was my biggest baby at 7lbs1oz, no stitches or tearing (3 for three, thank goodness!). She latched for a solid hour before they took her to get her weight and height, husband dressing her for the first time, while I took a quick bath. 

Needless to say, we are over the moon and love little Rowan Marie with our whole hearts. As a petite 35 year old lady, I worried my body would have more difficulty. But everyone is different and I’m glad to post a positive experience for others who may be worried for their own bodies. Again, I don’t wish to take away from the trauma many births unfortunately entail, mamas are so strong and have so much to overcome sometimes. I pray that everyone here has the birth experience they wish for, whatever that means to each and every mama.  💓

BabyBumps,Is there anyone here whose ultrasound showed big baby for gestational age AND ended up having baby come out close to the estimated “big” size?,"Asking because my OB is recommending that I get induction at 39 weeks due to big baby size scan taken at 35 wks (no gestation diabetes or any other reasons.) But I know these scans can be inaccurate, and Im seeing a lot of posts on here about babies that measured big on these scans coming out smaller than expected, thus making inductions seem kinda unnecessary. I’m also a slightly but under 5’, petite frame, SE Asian. Kinda separate but related issue is that as I’m trying to self-educate, it seems like so many of these research studies I’ve read were done in Europe or the West, so it’s difficult to try to decide if it applies to me too.",6,32,2021-07-18,gestational age
BabyBumps,Gestational age question.,"I had an transvaginal ultrasound on Monday at what we thought was 6 weeks as im a higher risk pregnancy. I knew I ovulated late but the dr thought i was 6 weeks based of period date. During the ultrasound we could only see the gestational sac and yolk sac. The technician said from what she sees she thinks I'm actually at 4-5 weeks which would make since due to the later ovulation. My dr after looking at the ultrasound said im around 5 weeks to come back in a week. 

They gave me a picture of the ultrasound but on it where it says GA. Its say 6w3ds

Sooooo how can they say im actually 5 weeks but have me as more on the ultrasound? Has this happened to anyone before.",5,8,2021-12-15,gestational age
BabyBumps,Small for gestational age and early induction no diagnosis of IUGR,"So this is my second baby. Let's start out by saying my first little girl was born at 40+3 days. I was induced at 40+1  due to her not moving when the doctors tried to get her to move. She came out purple, not breathing due to the cord being wrapped around her neck. She weighed 6lbs 11oz and we all went homw after 2 days. Now onto this pregnancy. This little girl is measuring in the 3rd percentile for her gestational age and the doctors want to induce me at 38 weeks. If she drops to the 2nd percentile, they want to induce me at 37 weeks. I had a hard time being induced with my first one and was upset that I am having to get induced again. The doctor said that my first daughter probably had the cord around he neck because she was also on the smaller side. She wasn't extremely small like this little girl is, but she is was still small. The doctor also mentioned that with babies this small, the longer you keep them in, the chances or a still borth or complications increase. That being said, inducing her early means possible nicu time, difficulty latching (I breast fed my first and really want to do it again. I will be heartbroken if I can't). If I get induced at 38 weeks then I will be induced 2 days before Christmas which is hard because I honestly don't want her to be born on Christmas. Being induced at 37 weeks means my husband would be doing his finals in college. That alone has a lot of stress and would be hard. So my question is should I try to push for just after Christmas or do as the doctor recommends regardless? Has anyone experienced having a small baby without being diagnosed with IUGR?",0,7,2021-11-27,gestational age
BabyBumps,Baby is small for gestational age,"Just had 36 week check up and baby is measuring about 2.5 weeks smaller than he should. This has never been brought up before. OB is ordering a growth ultrasound. 

Anyone had this before and it was fine? Of course doing google searches are just scaring me for worst case scenario.

BabyBumps,Choosing what year my son will be born…,"So I’m wondering your guys’ thoughts on this interesting quandary I find myself in. 

Basically, I am going to be having an elective Cesarean due to baby’s positioning and my medical history. I am completely at peace with this and can’t wait to meet little man! 

The dates available for the Cesarean according to my OB’s availability and the correct gestational age for my baby fall between December 27 and January 4. I know I could go into labour before then and need the cesarean earlier, but for now, I still need to schedule the date with my provider and essentially choose what year my son will be born. 

Now, this wouldn’t typically be a big deal or anything, but the catch is that *I had my first baby in early January of 2021.*

Yes, I know. It’s nuts, but it is what it is. 

So basically I’m choosing between having two babies in the same calendar year, or choosing to have them in the same calendar month. My problems and questions fall into the following areas: 

- I’m worried about my sons having their individuality as they will be so close in age: is it better to have the same birth month or same year? 

- I’m worried that the holidays will gloss over my second son’s birthday (Christmas and New Years) Anyone with birthdays near the holidays want to weigh in? Is it better to be after New Years then?

- If I choose December, will I have to explain until the end of time why I had two babies in 2021? 

- Is it tough celebrating 2 kid’s birthdays in the same month? Do they get disappointed or jealous? I’m big on birthdays and don’t want to combine parties and celebrations. 

- Also.. huge tax break if we pick December. This is the last thing on my mind, but it is a thing. 

I know in the end, none of this might matter at all, but I’m so curious as to what you all think. TIA!

ETA: *our district school year cut-off is September 1st, not January 1st, which is why I didn’t bring that up as a factor. They will definitely be in different grades.*",291,415,2021-12-05,gestational age
BabyBumps,"I've had a Failed Abortion, and I'm Grateful and Hopeful.","As I'm posting this I'm 22 weeks pregnant, and sitting in a high risk ward of the hospital until delivery.  My story is an odd one, and as I'm sharing it I know it may be removed, but I'm hoping maybe someone has had an experience like this and can give me some peace of mind/guidance, as Googling babies who have survived failed abortions isn't exactly fruitful.  

In 2020 my bf and I's relationship was failing.  My best friend kissed me, which bf didn't know about, and quickly I planned to leave.  Except I didn't.  We worked on our relationship and grew, but when I attempted to end the side partnership (yes, I know.) it quickly turned into sexual coercion and assault.  For a year.  I won't post all the details, just... please understand it was incredibly abusive, and I felt like my relationship with bf was the only good thing I had in my life.  The only reason I'm explaining this part is to help you understand why the abortion was attempted.  Things are more complicated and insidious than they seem.  May this year, I discovered I was pregnant.  I was angry, hurt, scared, I didn't want bf to raise a child that wasn't his, I was already being unfair to him, this... this I couldn't oblige.  I didn't and don't have periods consistently so I didn't know HOW pregnant I was.  

So, living in a restricted access state, I got the abortion pills online.  Through a trusted website.  A few weeks later they arrived, and they worked... I thought.  Insane cramps, the heaviest bleeding I ever went through, I almost passed out from the pain.  Then I tested negative on a pregnancy test.  All clear, so I thought.  A few weeks ago I started cramping heavily.  Like, abortion pill heavy, but no bleeding aside from spotting.  Heavy mucus, etc.  I thought a cyst had ruptured and not drained properly.  Eventually, I went to the ER.

""Are you pregnant?"" they asked, and I confidently said no.  Until they did the ultrasound.  I was VERY pregnant, and the gestational age.... it was my bf's.  The one person I did want a child with, the love of my life.   I had tried to abort this sweet, sweet child.  But, there's a problem.  My cervix is... gone.  Just, gone, you see that cramping was labor pains.  So I get sent to a specialized hospital, where I'm sitting now, and a week later my amniotic sac is trying to make its way into my vagina. 


 For now, I'm on meds to prevent labor, intense bed rest, and constant monitoring.  I'm so homesick, but more than that, I'm scared.  I wish I'd knew then what I know now, how my little one, seeing that ultrasound, well... it tore me apart.  I've always been and still am pro choice, but all I can think about it how I'm supposed to protect this baby from the world, and I may have caused them so much harm.  It's terrifying.  They've told me the ultrasounds, my biology aside, look great, babies' development looks great, etc.  But I'm scared.  What if she comes out and doesn't live long because of what I did?  What if she's born too premature?   I have so many fears, but also so much love and hope, I've never felt so fiercely.  I'm not religious but every kick from my child feels like a gift from God himself.

I just, frankly needed to tell someone my story, but also, if anyone has been through something similar I would love to hear yours.  I understand if this community doesn't take kindly to it, but I don't know where else to share.",351,84,2021-09-16,gestational age
BabyBumps,Why I'll never see another midwife,"My first child was born at 41 weeks. She was estimated to be 7 lbs and was born at 8lbs1oz. I had a natural unmedicated birth that ended in a 3rd degree tear and significant blood loss. It was horrific and traumatic for me. My recovery was significantly more difficult than any of my friends who had c sections. 

With this pregnancy, I have gestational diabetes. Baby has been consistently measuring large for gestational age. His size has been estimated 3x by ultrasound. His belly is measuring above the 99th percentile. I am terrified of delivering a large baby and have been begging for a c section.

My high risk doctor said I am not to go past 39 weeks because of the risk of my placenta failing. There are two midwives and two OBs at the regular practice I go to. One of the midwives told me that I absolutely could not have a c section unless the baby was measuring over 10 lbs. She also tried to convince me that I didn't have to listen to the high risk doctor and that I could go to 40 weeks. She didn't listen to any of my concerns.

On Monday at 36+6 I saw the second OB for the first time. At this point, baby is estimated at around 8 lbs. We went over the risks plus my fears and concerns. He recommended induction at 38+0 and felt it was the best option for me. He told me that I was free to wait until 39 weeks if I really wanted to and that he would recommend a c section at that point based on how my previous birth went, but he said that ultimately it was my decision. Now he is going to deliver my baby instead.

I saw the other midwife today, who I usually see, and she acted mad that the OB scheduled an induction for me at 38+0. She said she would have been ok with me going to 39 weeks. I told her that I was happy about the induction and explained why I thought it was a good idea. She still acted mad at him about it, said she would not have recommended that, and offered to reschedule my induction. I said no.

One of the midwives has completely ignored my concerns, the other has ignored my concerns and made potentially dangerous suggestions that go against what the high risk Dr said was necessary.

I will never again see another midwife. I'll be seeing this OB from here on out, including for my future annual visits. I have felt so ignored and like they didn't see me as an individual with individual medical history and needs.

I feel much safer and relieved now that I am having an early induction and am delivering with a dr who listens to me.",128,90,2020-07-17,gestational age
BabyBumps,Down syndrome markers at 7 week US,"UPDATE : The MD that I saw at the clinic yesterday gave me a call and apologized. She said that she felt like an “idiot” for misinterpreting the radiology report.  The suggestion written by the radiologist was only for scheduling purposes and the US seems fine ! I want to thank everyone for their replies and helping me keep my sanity ! Thank you thank you thank you !!!!

Hi everyone ! I live in Canada and I do not have a primary care physician so I have been followed by a clinic throughout my early pregnancy.  I do have an appointment with an OB in three weeks.  I had my first ultrasound at 6 weeks and 6 days last week.  They were able to identify the yolk sac, embryonic pole and heart rate of 123.  Yesterday, I received a call from the clinic saying that they wanted me to come in for a routine appointment and discuss my ultrasound results.  After a 3 hour wait, I was finally able to see the doctor only for her to tell me that there was a sentence she did not understand on my US results.  The radiology report states that a “ Nuchal translucency measurement is suggested at 12 weeks gestational age”.  She then went on saying that she wasn’t too sure what that meant as she had never seen a suggestion like that on an early dating ultrasound but that my baby most likely has markers for Down syndrome.  My question is, has anyone experienced this before and what was the outcome  ? Are MDs even able to identify markers this early on ?

BabyBumps,STOP COMMENTING ON MY BODY/ HEALTH/ SHARING HORROR BIRTH STORIES!!,"For the love of all that is holy can some one please explain to me why my belly is a magnet for unsolicited commentary.  Possibly an unpopular opinion, but I like talking to people and actually enjoy the offhanded congrats and good luck from strangers in line or cashiers at the store— this rant is not about them.  This rant is addressed directly to the people who see the belly and suddenly forget that if they don’t anything nice to say then they shouldn’t say anything at all. Pretty sure that was universally taught by all of our mamas, and I’m not sure why my growing belly (that I happen to have worked quite hard on and be quite proud of) changes etiquette rules for people.

So to the people who....
1.  Feel the need to comment on whether they think your belly is too big or too small for the gestational age— like man who commented on my “small” tummy size and then proceeded to ask if I was sure the baby was developing okay 

2.  Share an opinion or ask questions about my private health decisions (ex. “Are you remembering to take prenatales?”, “You should NOT be ordering green mangos, they can cause miscarriage”, “are you making sure to sleep in the left side? It’s healthiest.”)

3. Worst of all, see your belly and proceed to tell you an overly detailed birth horror story that they’ve heard.  (Ex: “I know someone who came out with a cone head and needed a helmet”, “so and so’s brother had to have facial reconstruction surgery because he got stuck so bad”, “this person tore straight through their butt hole, it was awful”)

To all of these people and to the people in categories I’m not currently thinking of, please for the love go relearn your manners.  STOP scaring us even more about delivery. There are no taksies backsies at 30 weeks, so please shut up about it already. And unless you’re my midwife, OB, or *maybe* my mother/ spouse STOP making us feel inadequate with overly invasive questions and opinions.  Just STOP... or I’m gonna tell your mom on you. :(

Okay, rant over.  Love and encouragement to everyone else going through this and feeling fed up. Xoxo",113,37,2021-04-05,gestational age
BabyBumps,"Baby Patrick, 4lb 5oz (IUGR, oligohydramnios) born at 36+2 - fast, unmedicated induction","First some background on the IUGR and oligohydramnios diagnosis, which I would have found helpful to read beforehand!  

I had a very easy pregnancy, physically (to the extent that I worried a lot at the beginning about the absence of symptoms like nausea and vomiting).  At the 20 week ultrasound, baby was all curled up with his hands and feet in his face, so the ultrasound tech couldn't see everything and she asked me to come back at 28 weeks - same thing - and then 31 weeks. At the time, we were excited, because my husband got to join for the third go around, and we joked that baby was on strike until papa could join us! At the third ultrasound, they mentioned that my amniotic fluid was on the low end of normal (7ish, and it should be 5-25), so we started weekly ultrasounds. Two weeks later, they did a growth measurement and found that he was pretty small for his gestational age, 20-somethingth percentile, but said it wasn't a problem as long as he kept pace.  

In future ultrasounds, my fluid fluctuated (but always low), but he did great on all the other metrics, moved regularly, passed NSTs, etc.  The 33-week growth scan showed similar weight percentile, but at 35 weeks he dropped below 10%. I had increased my fluids intake to 10c (80oz) a day, which was a lot for me, but it wasn't budging my amniotic fluid numbers. Between weight and fluids, this suggested my placenta wasn't doing its job.  

At 35 weeks, then, we were told to prepare for induction around 37 weeks. I made a list of priorities for the next two weeks, at work and at home. But at 36 weeks, the ultrasound showed my fluids were even lower - 3.5. The maternal fetal medicine doctor asked me to come back 2 days later, and to bring our hospital bags just in case. So I revised my list of priorities to those that could and should happen in the next two days....  

I definitely pushed myself too hard the next day. I'm a professor, and I rereviewed a paper, resubmitted a paper, submitted a huge grant proposal, and met for the first time with my brand new grad student.  I also picked up our car from the shop, dropped off returns, finished painting two door frames in the baby's future room, made 40 empanadas and another meal for the freezer, cooked and delivered dinner for a friend who had a baby a few weeks before, baked banana bread for a potential hospital stay, cleaned up some lingering messes in the house, and we packed our bags. We were really hoping to still have another week or so but had to err on the safe side!  

We got 4-5 hours of sleep Thursday night and then went in for the ultrasound at 9:15am (36+1). Baby passed the BPP just fine but fluids had dropped to 2.5. The MFM specialist checked with the birthplace and walked me over while my husband went to get the bags from the car.  

We got checked in, ordered lunch and ate, then I got tested for covid (and cried; it was terrible), got the beta methasone shot for baby's lungs (which they said would hurt but didn't at all), got an IV port placed (which took two tries, and ended up awkwardly in my left wrist) and my first cervical check - closed and hard. My OB came by to discuss the induction (with cytotec) and expectations. He said it could easily be 48 hours, especially because I was starting from absolute zero.  

They inserted the first tiny cytotec pill around 1 or 2pm.  I laid in bed and sent some emails canceling stuff for next week, reading on my kindle, snacking. I napped for about an hour and a half. The second dose came around 5 - after a check that found me still closed - and I started to feel some occasional tightening of my uterus. I hadn't had any Braxton hicks or anything, so it was my first time feeling contractions at all. They were so mild I couldn't tell when they ended, just when they started. At 8pm I got a 3rd dose of cytotec and was still basically closed.  

Then around 9:45, my water broke. I moved and felt some fluid - at first I thought it was just gel and discharge and stuff, because it wasn't a ton (but then again the reason we were there was because I didn't have much fluid to leak out!). They tested to confirm. Pretty quickly, the contractions got a bit more painful and, importantly, were only 2 minutes apart (30 to 40 seconds long). I texted the doula and she was pretty surprised that it had escalated so quickly.  

At 11:30pm the resident checked me again and I was 3cm, 50% effaced.  I think I got another dose of cytotec here.  The doula showed up shortly afterward and helped me try some different positions. I liked the birthing ball and 'throne' the best. My husband took a nap for about an hour and a half, which was a brilliant decision at that point. I mostly sat in throne position and breathed through the contractions, eyes closed, trying to rest in between.  

At some point i started shaking and threw up in the bathroom and felt a lot better, but then the contractions got worse. I had to moan through the peaks. Eventually I asked my husband to count the moans for me - at first 3 each time, then 4, then 5. I was also getting double peaks with almost every contraction, going almost all the way away before coming back for a second, slightly more intense round. Things also got worse because they were having a hard time getting good data on the monitors - the baby's heart rate data was sporadic and they never really had a good read on my contractions. They weren't confident that his heart rate was good, and if it was bad, how bad. They spent a lot of time moving the monitors and a few times made me change positions. That was frustrating because sometimes it was during a contraction, which made them so much worse, and also because I just didn't have the freedom of movement I wanted. The doula suggested a shower, but I couldn't, and the birth ball was also basically not compatible.  Later, when they really started to struggle with the monitors, they asked to put them in intravaginally. I sort of felt like it didn't improve the data that much though. They also did an amnioinfusion to get him a bit more cushioning in there.  

At one point, I decided I was basically at my limit - I could handle what I was feeling, but not anything more. I figured we were going to start pitocin soon so I asked for more fluids so I could an epidural. But they checked me and I was at 7cm, so they said I was so close! And I decided I could handle the status quo.  

I did some contractions on hands and knees and felt a strong urge to pee. On the toilet, I also had some urge to poop, and everyone was very curious about it, saying it might be the urge to push, but it was actually a poo!  The urge to pee stayed, though, and was apparently my cue to push.   

They checked me again at some point and I was 9cm, so they said I could push. I did a few on my knees draped over the top of the bed, then moved to my back. I saw my OB and some nurses setting up all the equipment to catch the baby, and that encouraged me.  Pushing felt like a poop that just wouldn't move, and it felt giant. (I had seen the plastic board that they used to gauge dilation and the 10cm circle freaked me the fuck out.)  Pushing definitely made him move down. I asked for a mirror and once saw a bit of a red (bloody) head show itself for a second before disappearing back in.  

Pushing was hard. Almost as bad was when the urge stopped and I had a big old head halfway down my vagina. Here someone said something very helpful - there will be times when your body wants to stop and you don't want to, but the tissues need time to stretch. That made a lot of sense to me as a biomechanicist (look up viscoelasticity), and completely changed my feelings about the breaks.  

They got me in stirrups and I yelled at people to hold my knees, which were shaking. All the pushes felt more or less the same. I was getting pretty foul mouthed, yelling fuck and I hate this and I can't do it. My husband kept telling me that this was very ""by the book"". I started to get hoarse, and the doula told me to keep the noise in and push that energy downwards. I think I did that for one or two rounds and the baby popped out, all at once! It was 5:17am, 20 hours after the ultrasound appointment began. 

I had a second-degree tear, which my OB said was - counterintuitively - because he was so small and came out all at once, instead of more slowly.

Baby was 4lb 5oz and did pretty well right off the bat.  Any concerns about his lungs were immediately assuaged because he cried passionately for about 10 minutes. I jokingly told him, in through your nose, out through your mouth.  The put him on my stomach and, the doula was right, I didn't mind the vernix or the blood all over him (or for that matter, me or the bed).  My husband cut the cord in one snip and then we brought him further up towards me.  

I really just couldn't believe it. That I had done that, that my body had taken to the induction so well, that he was here and okay, that it had gone so fast, that I did it without any drugs except cytotec.  

We stayed in the hospital for two and a half days, and were released after spending an hour in an interior conference room due to tornado warnings because 2020.  

A few comments that might be helpful to others: 

1. After my experience, it's very clear to me that it's not helpful to attach virtue to unmedicated births.  Mine was something I could handle, but if it had not been, I was interested in medication.  The unmedicated part was not due to something intrinsically strong or courageous in me, but I think more so in the nature of my birth.
2. I found it helpful to think about why I did or didn't want an epidural.  I wanted to maintain freedom of positions and didn't want to slow things down; when it looked like I wasn't going to have the former and the latter didn't seem to be an issue, it made sense for me to reconsider.  (And then when I was so close, it made sense to reconsider again.)
3. When I found out I was going to be induced, I slightly regretted having paid $800 to hire a doula.  In the end, I have no such regrets!   Inductions are not a one-size-fits-all story and she was still helpful in coaching, encouraging, preparing, suggesting positions, keeping me hydrated, etc.",243,23,2020-08-29,gestational age
BabyBumps,"FTM Birth Story: 5 day labor, 6wk Premature, Placenta Accreta (TW: Blood/loss)","Sorry, this is going to be super long because it is a very rare complication and I want to help others know my experience in case they are experiencing the same things, maybe could save someone's life. Scroll down to the ==== for the actual birth part, and \~\~\~\~ for the baby NICU part.

I got pregnant mid August 2019, 3 months of trying. I knew exactly when I conceived because it was smack dab in the middle of my cycle and I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the middle of the night that only lasted about 5 minutes, and just ""knew"". I have a good hold on my body, I guess (important later). 4 days later I had a positive pregnancy test, a week before my period was supposed to start (spoiler, it didn't)

I made an appointment with OB for my 8 week scan, and I found out that I actually had a natural twin that had died sometime around 6 weeks with no heartbeat (this is the loss btw), and one with a heartbeat. He measured exactly 8 weeks. Week 10, the non viable fetus's sac ruptured with a single bleed with waters. I had a NIPT test that confirmed it was a boy with no chromosomal abnormalities! Other than that, I had the perfect pregnancy. No morning sickness, just a few episodes of low blood sugar, sore boobs, and fatigue. Because of the twin, I had a placenta previa that ended up resolving its self by my 19 week anatomy scan.

The problems started week 30.  I started having pains a few inches below my belly button, kinda right on top of my pelvis and lower back muscle pain. Because of this pain, I couldn't use the tummy/back brace thing I bought. I started not being able to ride in the car for longer than 15 minutes without getting strong braxton hicks, back pain that radiated to the front, that lower belly pain, and what felt like cervical pain. Week 31 picked up my husband from the airport and cried all the way home in pain, but didn't want to go to the ER because of COVID. It went away as soon as I got home. I was timing the pain and it was about 4 minutes apart. I chalked it up to false labor because of the hour long car ride. I brought it up to my OB at my 32 week and he assured me some pain is normal at this stage, especially since the car could agitate false labor. He stressed if a warm bath, lots of water, and laying on my side doesn't make it stop to come in to L&D. He gave me a cervical exam, I was 50% effaced and not dilated.

The pelvic and back pain continued into week 32 and 33, with many braxton hicks and period like cramps. I had a regular OB appointment Wednesday 3/18, and because baby was measuring big, I was set to go to a specialist OB Thursday 3/19. At my OB appointment Wednesday, I stressed I was in a lot of pain. I broke down and cried because a wave of pain (like a contraction) hit me in the middle of explaining the pain to him. He gave me a cervical check and I was 50% effaced and 2cm dilated. He sent me home with a prescription for Nifedipine. I took it that night and got some sleep, at least.

Next day 3/19 I went to my specialist OB appointment for baby measuring 2 weeks ahead and possible preeclampsia. I told him about my pain during my scan and he said baby's head was wedged up far into pelvis so much he was having a hard time getting a good look at the head. He said sometimes pain happens when baby's head is up in there, and to watch some Netflix or something and relax. Woo. I went home and worked (WFH), until I could no longer stand to sit. Around 4pm, I started actually leaning on my couch upside down to move baby off my pelvis, the pain was so unbearable I was going crazy thinking of SOMETHING that might relieve the pain! At this point it felt like someone was stabbing me in my lower stomach with terrible back pain that radiated to the front and down my legs. I ended up in my bed crying and writhing in pain before I realized the pain was most intense exactly 5 minutes apart. ""Is this contractions?"" I thought. No, I didn't want to be a worry wart, and I could still talk through them, and they didn't start at the top of my uterus. I did what my doctor said and I went to take a warm bath. Contractions still happened in there. Got out of the bath, drank huge amount of water quickly, still contracting. Hastily made a boiled egg sandwich, pissed off, still contracting. Around 7pm, told the husband we needed to go to the hospital right when it started pouring rain. We made it to the hospital alive. Due to COVID, the entrance people wanted me to go to the ER, but I told them (begged them) through contractions to let me go straight to L&D. They called up and L&D accepted me.

I got into a deliver theater and hooked up to the fetal monitor. They couldn't really find my contractions but obviously saw I was in pain every 3 minutes. Doctor came in and did a cervical check, 75% effaced, stretchy 2cm dilated. The hospital I was going to deliver at does not do NICU babies. They told me I could deliver here and baby could be helicopter flighted to the nearest NICU hospital (Dallas), or I could be ambulance transported there while still pregnant. They strongly suggested I be transferred there as I'd receive better care. I REALLY liked this hospital, it was practically brand new, only about 5 years old so everything was fancy and updated. I was upset, but I wanted what was best for my baby, so I chose the ambulance. They started me on magnesium, stuck a catheter in me (not pleasant without the epidural), and gave me my first steroid shot (also unpleasant). I think around an hour passed, still contracting, magnesium in full force (hot, sweaty, disoriented) they did another cervical check and I was 75% effaced, stretchy 3cm dilated. Stuff was happening for real. The ambulance transport was called and I was transported to Dallas (about an hour drive).

I was now in a delivery theater in Dallas where I saw many different people, honestly it was a blur at this point as it was already 3AM and I kinda just wanted to go home (haha...). I was still on the magnesium, and they started me on a round of antibiotic because I didn't get my Strep B test yet. While I was being transported, husband went home to collect some stuff like entertainment, clothes, etc. and arrived around 5AM. Another cervical check was performed and I was still 75% effaced and 3cm dilated. On the magnesium, the pain was still there but fading in and out, it was a nice change. I was able to catch some sleep early in the morning 3/20. They sent me up to antepartum because the magnesium worked for now at delaying dilation.  I was now on Nifedipine, Norco, IV fluids waiting in a regular small cramped hospital room with nothing but my Nintendo Switch and the new Animal Crossing game to keep me and hubby company. Seriously, that game was a life saver.

Despite the drugs, IV fluids and drinking plenty of water (now catheter free thank god), I was still having contractions every 10 minutes apart. They kept hooking me up to the fetal stress monitor on and off thru the day of 3/20 and decided to send me back to a labor room at the wee hours of 3/21. They gave me another round of Nifedipine and Norco that stopped my labor in it's tracks and I got my 2nd round of steroids for baby. The drugs unfortunately only lasted 12 hours. As soon as they sent me back to Antepartum, contractions were back. This series of events happened twice, and a lot of it is a blur, but I was went down to L&D and back up to Antepartum twice.

3/23 I was in pain the majority of the day. I could barely sit up in the bed to eat my hospital meals, and just the pressure of everything made any position almost impossible. I was hooked up to the fetal monitor most of the day but they could never really see my contractions on that thing, so they gave me a button to push every time I ""felt"" a contraction. I started to feel like some of the nurses didn't believe me, that I wasn't having ""real"" contractions. I started asking when I could go home and if I could just deal with it at home until my due date (lol yeah, I was getting a little crazy at this point). That evening my husband went home for a bit to take care of the animals, I was on the toilet trying really hard to pee or something (the pressure was real). The doctor came in on me and asked how I was doing, I just said ""well I feel like I have to push but nothings coming out, so there's that."" he just said ""well, Nifedipine isn't going to stop real labor, and I think you're in real labor, It's been more than 48 hours since your steroids so I think we are going to send you to L&D and take you off the drugs and see what happens."" He also did a cervical check on me and I was 100% effaced and 4cm dilated, -2 station and bag was felt. Stuff was still happening despite their best efforts to stop it. This was day 5 of this. I was tired, I was SO done. My husband comes back right as they were gathering the team to wheel me back downstairs. At this point I was 34+2 weeks.

====================

It was very busy the night of 3/23. The L&D was so busy I was placed in a temporary emergency room like room with just curtains separating several people. I was there for an hour, got another cervical check 100% effaced, stretchy 4cm dilated, -2 station and bag was felt  (no change) and waited. Finally got a room, hooked up to the fetal monitor and left to my own devices. Hours passed by without much checks. I figured they were busy and the people watching the fetal monitors didn't see my contractions, so no big deal I was. I figure I was just going to get sent back up to Antepartum anyway and my special hell would continue for a month possibly. At this point I'd given up hope. My only hope was that I could feel my contractions, and I knew they had to be doing SOMETHING. My husband found it somewhat amusing he could hear the other women scream in pain and agony from our room. I had another urge to use the restroom, my husband helped me and I felt that urge to push again. This time, a trickle was heard even after I had urinated and I told my husband ""I'm not peeing, that's my water."". My water FINALLY broke, things were visibly HAPPENING! I was happy, husband was panicking. I got back into bed and weirdest sensations of water gushing followed. Nurse came in and confirmed it was my waters and told me I was having the baby today. It was now 3/24 around 2am. Not long after, the anesthesia man came in and did the epidural. I was scared of it but honestly it wasn't as bad as people played it out to be. Started on Picotin as well to speed up labor since LO would be a preemie and delaying after water breaking increased some risks.

Left alone for a while again, someone finally checked up on me about 3 hours later. I suppose they were watching my contractions on the monitor which were CLEARLY visible now, thanks to the Picotin, so I wasn't ignored or anything even though it felt that way lol. My body at this point felt like some sort of plant, couldn't move, couldn't feel my lower half, no more pain, life was good. 10/10 recommend epidural. Especially for what comes next.

At around 5:30 am, cervical check again, they didn't get very far. ""Oops, there's baby's head!"" 100% effaced, 10cm dilated, 2 station. He was ready to come out! They hastily set up the theater with a table full of supplies, geared up, put my legs in stirrups and told me how to push. When the doctor was ready, we pushed. 3 sets of 10 second pushing was all it took and he was out at 6:01am! Probably all of 5 minutes. No tears, but I did not escape without a large hemorrhoid.

The NICU team was ready to receive him, as they were assessing him the doctor was massaging my stomach to detach the placenta. He scored a 9.9 on APGAR. Nurses were mumbling to themselves about how it was impossible that this is a 34 week baby. He came out 6lbs 6oz, 19"". One of them asked me if I was SURE about his gestational age, and another corrected her saying ""Yeah, she had a 8 week dating scan."". Guess I just make GIGANTIC babies? He was handed to me wrapped up in a bundle of joy, my husband taking many pictures. Doctor was still massaging my stomach and apparently had her whole arm in my vagina. This is where the sh\*t hit the fan.

Baby was hastily taken away from me, even though the NICU team gave the clear for skin to skin time. At this point I sorta looked down (huuuge mistake) and you know how farmers check on pregnant cows by sticking their entire arm in the cows butt? Yeah. That. Exactly that. Plus much blood. My husband became visibly concerned. Shortly that, I started shaking uncontrollably, feeling very cold. The doctor said the placenta was coming out in pieces, and what felt like some calcification. They were somewhat yelling to themselves about how much blood I had lost, no one knew, they had only speculated because someone had apparently made a mistake with the bucket (placed gauze or something in it, not sure). I remember them unplugging me from everything and starting to wheel me out of the room. I was saying to one of the nurses ""I'm cold, can I have more blankets please?"" they told my husband to stay in the room. I had NO IDEA what was happening, and obviously my brain wasn't comprehending I was dieing of blood loss, but my body knew because I was going into hypovolemic shock. I briefly heard them saying something to my husband that if whatever they were about to do didn't work, they'd have to take my uterus. I was ok with it at the time, I guess (shock does weird stuff to you lol).

I was now in the OR fading in and out, shaking so bad my arms were coming up off the bed. Funnily enough, my lower half was still completely immune to this shaking. They have transferred me to the OR table and started to perform a curettage (D&C?) to remove the placenta parts. I could hear the vacuum and felt the scraping sensation and it was all really bazaar. I thought it was interesting they tilted the table so that my head was closer to the ground, I guess so my brain got more blood or something? The nurses were now getting mad at the lab because they were trying to get my blood count and they ran the wrong test the first time, oops. A lot of stuff going wrong here, I thought. Luckily they got it going.

I probably needed a transfusion. They start to get another IV line in me just in case but couldn't get a vein. I have HARD veins to begin with and they were non existent with my blood loss. Took them a while to finally get one in my foot. I was in recovery at this point with a balloon in my uterus to control the bleeding.  It's basically a catheter but for your uterus that inflates and puts pressure on the uterine walls, collects blood that is expelled to be measured. After waking up a little, still a bit cold, nurse informs me if bleeding doesn't stop they will take my uterus. They said I had placenta accreta, it was very rare, and that even \*IF\* I keep my uterus, they strongly recommend no more pregnancies, and if I do get pregnant, I'd be high risk and my uterus would be removed at delivery then. At this point the shock daydream wore off and I was kinda bummed about it. I was sent back to a delivery room for close observation the rest of the day.

I was sorta loopy the whole day, didn't really try to move much, slept a lot. My oxygen was dipping according to the beepy machine. Sometime during the middle of the day I ended up needing a unit of blood, felt slighly better afterward. They sent me back to Antepartum (now postpartum I guess). I got news my baby was doing really well and was just a little bit jaundice with low blood sugar, but didn't require any breathing treatments. He just needed to eat. I felt like such a shit person because it was almost 16 hours after birth and I still haven't seen him at all. Husband was at my side the whole time. Finally got a nurse to show husband where baby was and he got to hold him for an hour or so. When he got back I attempted to take a shower (hadn't showered since that bath before I went to the hospital... I was.. uh.. ripe) and almost feinted. I couldn't see the baby if I couldn't sit up right for more than a few minutes. I was so mad at myself. Not to mention I wanted to breast feed, and do all sorts of other magical stuff with my newborn like skin to skin, close contact, etc, as per handbooks. The good news is I wasn't bleeding, it appears my uterus lives to see another day (and I do to, I guess).

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

3/25 in the morning, I managed to feel somewhat well enough to wheel myself to the NICU and see baby. They wouldn't let my husband in at the same time because of COVID. I was lucky he was even able to stay at the hospital with me at all. I felt so disconnected with him I couldn't believe he was my baby. I cried and told him I was sorry while I held him. I only held him for 30 minutes before the nurse noticed I was swelling and recommended I go back to my room, so I did. Baby was doing great and taking about .5 oz thru bottle and the rest thru tube feeding. I had more labs and my blood count was still too low for them to release me. I was given another transfusion. After the transfusion, I felt much better! They discharged me in the evening. I was able to stay in my room as a non-patient (known as ""rooming in"") so that I could visit baby. I started pumping and giving baby some colostrum. Husband was kicked out at this point because of COVID. Baby was being fed formula, which was fine.

3/26 Doctors said if he ate 2oz he could come home. He was at around 1.5oz at this point, I was super excited. I stayed another night in the hospital room pumping and playing Animal Crossing.

3/27 Doctors said if he ate 2.5oz he could come home. He was eating barely over 1.5oz. I felt like I was being strung along at this point,  but they were still tube feeding him and giving him some UV treatments so it was for the best.

3/28 I went home, I couldn't be in the hospital any longer. I was going nuts being all alone, though I did enjoy the company of the NICU nurses who taught me tips and tricks on how to feed and change him. I was feeding him every feed except the 2am feed, because I needed sleep lol.

I visited for a few hours on 3/29, 3/30 and I was informed that if he ate really well the night of 3/30, I could room-in on 3/31 and take him home on 4/1. I brought my bags 3/31 and was so excited. My husband was excited even though he couldn't come to the hospital with me or bring him home with me. When I got to the NICU, a pediatrician and 2 nurses were hovering over his bed talking to themselves. The doctor noticed I had came in and said ""Sorry, you can't stay with him tonight."" He was having a random episode of pauses of breathing (apnea). I was devastated. I held back my tears while the nurses were talking to me but after holding him for an hour or so I went to my car and just cried and cried.

4/1 I was told I could try rooming in again that Friday, 4/3 if he had NO MORE episodes. He did not! I got to room in 4/3 and 4/4 I was promptly rushed out the door alone with my newborn no later than 11am lol, which worked for me because I did NOT want anything to do with the hospital at that point. The hospital gave me a lot of freebies which I'm still using like little breast milk cups and stuff. Bonus!

I'm now 4 weeks postpartum, my hemorrhoid has healed, baby has been home 3 weeks, and life is wonderful. He is such a good baby! But I mostly credit that to the NICU nurses who took care of him during his most critical period. I still get a little dizzy from time to time but my bleeding has stopped completely and I am taking iron supplements. I am exclusively bottle feeding and pumping but I am only getting about 1.5oz of breast milk still due to blood loss and lack of first contact... But it's something, right?

I saw my OB at 2  weeks postpartum and he was shocked. He said in his 20 years of OB, he'd only seen 4 other cases like mine. Me being the 5th. He said only 1.5% of all pregnancies have this complication, and I had none of the risk factors except MAYBE the twin.  He was sorry the pain I was having was definitely due to the accreta, as there might have been internal bleeding going on as well. He said I could have another child 2-3 years down the line and it would be high risk, but accreta shouldn't happen again. This was a huge difference than what the OR doctor had told me in the hospital. I am not sure who is being more conservative and if I really want another baby after all that anyway....

Anyway, my advice to anyone having pains similar to mine, don't try to ignore it and try to push for answers. Also, if you are planning a home birth or some other type of birth not in a hospital and you have any of this pain, don't do it. It's not worth your life! It's hard, and you might get told to just relax and watch Netflix, but get help at the first sign you might need it because if you THINK you do, you do! You are not going to be a burden to anyone.

Trust your gut, I had a feeling baby was coming early, I had his room done at 28 weeks and I went on an Amazon shopping spree to get every last item i needed for him at 30 weeks. Coincidence? I don't know.  I just had one of those feelings. Thanks for reading!",123,38,2020-04-25,gestational age
BabyBumps,Doctors have to stop to talk off the top of their heads.,"So I started this pregnancy with a BMI of 26, which is a little overweight. OB said I should gain about 22 pounds during the pregnancy, fine. Well, at my 24 weeks appointment last week, I gained it all already. OB said nothing this time (but he said I should be careful at every appointment before, I think he gave up), but when my one-hour glucose test came 145, he referred me to an internal disease doctor. This doctor said I should take the 3-hour test, which was reasonable. I took it and all my figures were great. He said that I don't have gestational diabetes and my blood pressure is perfect, but gave me a whole lecture about weight, exercising and healthy eating, just because I am a little overweight.

Well, hear me out. I had PCOS since I was 15, so weight is something I struggled all my life, even when I was in the ""normal range"". Weight is a vicious cycle with PCOS. But prior to this pregnancy, I didn't eat ANY refined sugars and refined carbs FOR A YEAR. I was already walking and doing yoga. I was fairly athletic my entire life. I know about macros, vitamins and micronutrients. If you ask me, I think I know even too much for a non-specialist! But because of my weight, doctors just assume that I am lying around all day and eating junk. They don't even ask first about my eating and exercising habits!

And since I am lurking around these pregnancy subs for a while now, I understand that a lot of women suffer from similar approaches. I also understand that every pregnancy and body is unique, that water weight is real and the added risk from weight gain is rather small. I feel like they are just talking based on some memorized lines and do not consider the unique circumstances of every patient. This has to stop. Mental health is as important as physical health, and the pressure they put on us because of a few pounds on the scale is ridiculous. The stress harms the baby and mother more than the few pounds.

We need to create awareness on this issue, but I am not sure how.

&#x200B;

I feel like I have to include this research here, too:

[https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/39/1/24](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/39/1/24)

""Several lifestyle intervention trials targeted at limiting gestational weight gain or preventing obesity-related perinatal complications, including GDM, have been performed (21–29). However, the results have been inconsistent; some studies (22,25,27,28) have been successful in reducing gestational weight gain, but the effect on GDM incidence has been minor (23–29).

The primary outcome of the Finnish Gestational Diabetes Prevention Study (RADIEL) was to examine the effect of **combined moderate physical activity and diet intervention** in high-risk women on the incidence of GDM in a randomized controlled study setting.

(...)

Weight Change

There was a difference in gestational weight gain between the intervention group (2.5 kg \[95% CI 2.1–3.0\]) and the control group (3.1 kg \[95% CI 2.7–3.5\]) from baseline to the second trimester (at the time of the OGTT at week 23.4 on average), and the mean difference was −0.5 kg (\[95% CI −1.1 to 0.05\]; P = 0.072, unadjusted; P = 0.039, after adjustment for age, previous GDM status, the number of weeks of gestation, and baseline weight).

The gestational weight gain was 7.6 kg (95% CI 6.7–8.3 kg) in the intervention group and 7.7 kg (95% CI 7.1–8.4 kg) in the control group from baseline to the third trimester, and the mean difference was −0.2 kg (\[95% CI −1.1 to 0.8\]; P = 0.74, unadjusted; P = 0.37, after adjustment for age, previous GDM status, the number of weeks of gestation, and baseline weight).

(...)

CONCLUSIONS

**Despite the fact that only a small proportion of the women in the intervention group reached the physical activity goals, and the difference in weight gain was modest between the groups, it is obvious that the individual changes in lifestyle do not need to be large, but together they have a beneficial effect on the reduction of the incidence of GDM.**

(...)

A moderate individualized lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence of GDM by 39% in high-risk pregnant women. These findings may have major health consequences for both the mother and the child.""",29,24,2021-12-15,gestational age
BabyBumps,Terrible midwife experience/birth story,"Hello everyone, I’m still fuming about my birth center experience with my third baby. She’s almost a day old now, born 10/13 at 9:20pm at 39+5 weeks.

I’ve been seeing a midwife group for the entirety of my pregnancy and it’s been great, saw the same people last pregnancy and had a smooth water birth. First pregnancy was at the same location just different people, yet a smooth experience. So of course I chose the same place for this pregnancy.

The only issue arose when my water broke at 4pm on Tuesday 10/12 and the midwives did not care one bit. I had consistent contractions and they kept telling me to wait an hour and call again. I did this until 10pm when I just went to bed. The next morning I woke up to a text saying to take Castor Oil, which I absolutely declined, so they said drink red raspberry leaf tea, which I also declined. They never thought to have me come in to check dilation, didn’t seem worried that my water broke, they honestly didn’t seem to believe me. They said to come by to pick up a tincture to take! Zero offer of comfort or support, I was really worried about issues arising so I drove downtown to the best hospital in my city. 

They got me hooked up to baby monitors that instantly showed I was contracting, I just couldn’t feel them. When I hit 24 hours of my waters being broken they started me on a very low dose of pitocin to get things going. I received a missed call from the midwives asking if I picked up the tincture! No questions on how I was doing, or anything. Zero concern for myself or baby. 

But the nurses and doctors at the hospital were very understanding, and extremely thoughtful and helpful.
After 5 hours on the pitocin my beautiful girl was born at 9:20 pm after only 2 pushes! I’m so happy we made the right choice, no infection or issues. She was sunny side up initially but after some positioning during contractions she turned and came out easy with no tearing or anything.

She’s now almost 24 hours old and I have heard NOTHING from the midwives. 

Am I justified on leaving a review for others to see? I still haven’t wanted to talk to them because I’m just angry at their lack of care.

BabyBumps,I gave birth alone,"I gave birth on my own. Not just without my husband but literally alone, no midwife. In the hospital, but completely alone. My little one is a month old now and it has taken me this long to be able to write this out. I've read many birth stories on here but never posted before, I'm hoping this helps me process. 

I was induced because baby was late (41+3). I was induced with my first pregnancy too. That time induction started on the Friday and baby wasn't born until Monday. I was prepared for (and also quite terrified of!) a long induction with this one too. Last time, my husband stayed with me the entire time,  sleeping in a chair. A comfy chair, but still a chair. 

So, this time we went in for induction. Cervix was not dilated, not effaced so got the propess pessary at about 6pm. Monitored baby for an hour afterward and then walked to the car with my husband to get our bags (initially thought we'd be going home after the pessary was inserted as my hospital does outpatient inductions but my BP was a bit high so decided to stay in). Sat on a bench outside the hospital for a while with my husband chatting - still not feeling any affects of the pessary. We decided that my husband would come and hang out with me for a bit and then head home to get some sleep about 9pm. 

By the time we get back to labour ward, I'm beginning to have what I think are contractions but they are coming about a minute apart and lasting a minute. I press the buzzer to let someone know but midwife doesn't come. The receptionist from the front desk comes in and says she'll let my midwife know. I'm concerned because I'm pretty sure I'd read in outpatient induction leaflet the previous day that contractions close together like that were a sign of hyperstimulation of the uterus which is an undesirable side effect of the propess pessary. Contractions continue to increase in intensity so I press the buzzer again as it's been about 20 minutes since the receptionist left. 

A midwife turns up a little while later. When she first gets there I'm having a contraction and I'm not able to talk to her. She continues to try and ask me questions while I'm contracting when I clearly am not able to respond. In the break between contractions I manage to ask if this was normal and she says ""Well, are we having a baby or not?!"" I explain that I've had the pessary and I'm concerned about the closeness together of the contractions and she says that this is just what they call ""propess pains"" and it will probably be like this all night so I should try to calm down and get some sleep. That midwife becomes my midwife for the rest of the night.

At this point I'm horrified that I could have to do this all night. The contractions are extremely intense. She offers paracetamol which I take. My husband leaves around this point to go and get some sleep. I also try to get some sleep but realise soon enough this is going to be impossible. I lie propped up in the bed on my own trying to breathe through the contractions as they come. 

We live relatively close to the hospital (10 minutes) and my husband texts to say he's at home. He asks if I'm going to sleep and I tell him I'm in agony so no. The midwife comes back and offers me oromorph. I take it as I'm convinced this is going to last all night. 

A few more minutes pass and I am actually screaming in pain with every contraction. I'm really not coping very well. The midwife comes back and decides she'll check my cervix. I have to get out of bed to get my leggings off and I can barely do that due to the contractions in my stomach but also in my thighs and back. 

I'm only 3cm dilated. Not even in active labour. Couldn't even feel baby he was so high. She gives me the impression that I'm completely overreacting to the contractions and panicking and gets me to focus on by breathing for a while. I'm fine then, it's easier when I'm not alone. It still hurts obviously but I can do it. I'm feeling sick too. She gives me a sick bowl.

Then she leaves, I mean I'm not even in""proper"" labour. Maybe she has other patients? She comes back a little while later, offers me pethidine. I accept. Anything, please, help. How can I do much more of this? Only 3cm, there is so long left to go. She goes to get it. 

A senior midwife comes in. She must have heard me. She's arrived between contractions, I can offer you a warm bath or pethidine she says. A warm bath sounds nice I start to say and then the contraction starts and I hear myself shout pethidine. 

My midwife is back. With the pethidine. It's got something in it to help you feel less sick too she says. Whatever, I'm thinking. Just give it to me. I say it sort of feels like I have to poo, last time when that happened that was the baby ready to come. She just looks at me. She gives me the pethidine and leaves. I text my husband saying I need to push. He asks if my waters have broken, they haven't, he tells me to keep him updated if I think it's happening...

Midwife comes back. Asks if the pethidine has kicked in. I have honestly no idea. I feel helpless. No one is listening to me. I tell her I can't do this. She looks pityingly at me and says maybe I should call my husband and tell him to come back so he can help me cope. I ring him he says ""Is it actually happening or are you just panicking?"" This horrifies me. Either way I need you, I tell him. I say tell, I mean shouted. He tells me he's getting in the car, he texts me saying he's leaving at 10.42. Then the midwife leaves me. 

Completely alone now, I really do feel the urge to push. I push a little and my waters break in a huge gush soaking the bed. I press my buzzer. The baby is right there, I feel him. The receptionist runs in and I shout my waters broke and I hear her shout ""I see the head"" and she runs off. 

I push properly now. I have to get him out. The urge is overwhelming. I lay on my side. First big push, I feel the burning, what I've heard call the ring of fire. Didn't feel this last time, I had an epidural. I push his head out with that one push. Then another push and he slides out onto the bed into the pool of amniotic fluid. I sit up and reach down and grab him. He's purple. The cord is wrapped round his neck and he's not making any noise. I scream for help. I take my fingers and unwrap the cord, twice I have to uncurl if from around his neck. Please, please make a noise. He starts to cry. The relief. 'Hello, baby"" I say. Then suddenly there are people there. Midwives.  

I lay back down, baby on my chest. The senior midwife was there. Someone gave me the injection for the placenta, something I didn't want unless necessary but no one asked me. I lay there in shock barely looking at my lovely baby. I can't believe it's happened. Placenta delivers pretty quickly. I remember asking if I tore, she has a look and says just a small second degree one. I got to cut the cord. 

I call my sister who is home with my other son and quickly tell her the baby is here and ask how long ago my husband left. He should be here soon. He texts me saying ""I'm here"" at 10.59.  I respond ""he's here"" at 11.03. 

They are talking about moving me to a delivery room, bit late I think... I need to get up and someone needs to hold the baby. I hear someone outside say my husband was there. I say he can hold the baby. He comes round the curtain and the midwife gets him to pass her towels that she wraps around baby and passes him to my husband. That is how he meets his son. My husband tells me later he didn't know the baby was here until he walked in the room.

I went from 3cm to baby being there in less than half an hour. I know now that this was I know now that this was preciptous labour. This is more common when using the propess pessary for induction. There are recognisable signs. But no one even considered that. 

Obviously, I was just not coping well with pain because I was panicking. Just a pathetic woman who couldn't manage. No one believed that the baby was imminent, even though I felt it and I knew it, I was dismissed. It couldn't possibly be. I knew the baby was coming but I couldn't make them understand that. Not even my husband (this I am really struggling with). I doubted myself and my body. I told myself I was wrong. But I wasn't, and I had to deliver my own baby. 

Initially, just after he was born, I felt empowered and proud of myself for delivering by baby alone. But now I've had time to process, I am horrified. I'm traumatised. What if something had gone wrong? I am so lucky that nothing did but that thought lingers and scares me. Someone other than me should have realised that my baby was coming.",3666,340,2021-10-02,birth experience
BabyBumps,A male partner's experience of a positive birthing story that many might initially see as negative based on the numbers! 32 hours of labor and 6 hours of pushing!!!!,"Hi there!

Thank you all for your stories, support, and encouragement of each other.

I wanted to take some time to write something I don't see very often: a birthing story from the lens of the guy. What can you expect? What is it really like? My partner encouraged me to make this post for all the guys out there, so, here it goes.

At week 39, my partner was more than ready to be done with pregnancy lol. She decided to be induced on her delivery day. The baby was breech in the first and second trimester, but luckily, he turned around on his own near the beginning of the third trimester.

We scheduled the induction for 7:15 AM at exactly 40 weeks at the hospital of our choice. We were hoping for a later time, but that is all they had available.

The staff was exceptionally kind and patient, taking the time to explain everything. The room was large and contained a couch and rocking chair, along with the typical hospital bed. At 8:45 AM they put my partner on a nutrient IV along with a Pitocin IV. She was already at 3cm dilated when she entered the hospital and had experienced a few minor contractions the previous few nights.

Partner decided that she wanted to try to have a natural birth with no epidural. She did amazing, and was certain she would be okay. After 4 hours of Pitocin, at 12:45 PM, she was at 4cm dilated. The nurse told me to go get some lunch in the cafeteria as it was possible things would come along very quickly. Partner was not allowed any food.

Another 3 hours went by, and at about 4pm, she was 5cm dilated. Contractions were becoming more intense and slightly painful. She found it really helpful to have me breathe with her, so I spent the whole time by her side, breathing along with her. At 5pm the contractions were getting even more intense and painful, so the nurse helped me get behind my partner, with my legs wrapped around her. Her fluids were all over the bed, and they soaked through my pants, but in the moment I didn't even notice. I was just focusing on breathing with her.

At about 6:45 pm she was 6cm dilated, and the nurse told me to go get dinner before the cafeteria closed at 7pm. I really didn't want to leave her side, but they both told me to get food so I would have enough energy to stay awake and active. When I returned 15 minutes later, the contractions were much more intense, but she was still at 6cm. Guys be ready for your lady to shit in bed, and don't make a fuss about it! Lots of shit during this experience. It is what it is! Just keep her comfortable! My partner was self conscious about it, but the nurse and I made sure to laugh it off. At 7:30pm, there was a nurse shift change. My partner was in a lot of pain at this point, and she found it extremely helpful for me to cram my knee into her back to apply counter pressure. Guys, this can get tiring very quickly, but I found I was able to apply pressure to her lower back with my knee for hours straight by cramming my leg in between a large chair and her back and just pushing against the chair with my foot.

By 9 pm things were getting really intense, and she had only made a tiny amount of progress -- not even at 7cm yet. She was now howling in pain. It had been just over 12 hours since the Pitocin began. At 10pm she was really howling in pain. I suggested an epidural, and she told me to shut the fuck up lol. At 11:30pm, she asked the nurse to check her progress, and was dismayed to hear that no real progress had been made; she was still just under 7cm dilated. My warrior queen made it 15 hours without the epidural, and finally, to my relief, she relented, and asked for it. She was in so much pain, and was trying any and all positions to make it better to no avail. The whole time, baby seemed perfectly happy with an ideal heartbeat.

At 11:45 they began the epidural, and by 12am, she was already starting to smile from the pain relief. She explained that the biggest issue wasn't the pain itself, but the intense urge to push despite it not being time to push. By 12:30 AM, she was still 7cm dilated, baby was happy in there. The nurse told us to get some rest and prepare for the big end game the following morning. We were both exhausted, so she passed out, and I set myself up on the couch.

The doctor and nurses came back at 6:30 am to check on her. She was at 10cm dilated, which really excited her to have had all that progress while she was asleep, and baby was at position 0, so he still had some distance to lower. I went to cafeteria to fill myself up with caffeine and food, then came back. From 7 to 8:30am, she continued to lightly nap while I kept filling myself with coffee in preparation for the big pushes. At 8:30am, baby was low enough to begin pushes.

My beautiful partner pushed for 6 freaking hours, never giving up. Baby's head was big lol, very big, and they didn't think he would be able to make it past her relatively tight pubic bone. The doctor came in after 2.5 hours of pushing and said that it was definitely tight, but if worse came to worst, he thought he could get my boy out with the vacuum (guys, this is basically a suction cup they attach to their head). Guys, be prepared to see your partner's vagina extremely flappy and elongated. The nurses literally stretch it out like it's playdoh. Again, don't make a thing out of it! It is what it is! When she stretched it out, I could see my boy's head and hair inside of her, so it was clear he was so close.

2 more hours of pushing went by. 4.5 hours of pushing now. The doctor was finishing up in a surgery upstairs, and we were just waiting for him to come back. The nurse told us it was possible that we would have to do a c-section and prepared us for what that would entail. She got my gown ready, and told us what would happen, exactly where we would go, etc. At 5.5 hours, my beautiful partner was STILL pushing. I have no idea how she still had the energy or will. The doctor came in, and was certain he could get baby out with the vacuum. He set it up, and after 7 contractions of pushing, he finally came out. Baby's neck was all twisted around his spine like he was the girl from the exorcist, and I almost had a heart attack thinking he was dead, but no one looked even remotely concerned. It's incredible how flexible the newborns are, because he was perfectly fine!! My partner and my boy had some instant skin to skin time while I snipped the umbilical cord. I started to get scared again when I saw all the blood flowing out of my partner's vagina. ""Is she okay,"" I asked with tears in my eyes. The doctor just smiled and said this was all perfectly normal. Nothing to be worried about, but of course, I couldn't stop worrying. My partner ended up getting level 2 tears and at least 8 stitches. In the mean time, I got to have some skin to skin time with my boy while my partner finished getting stitched up and finally got to eat some food. 2 weeks later, she is still recovering, but is coming along just fine!

Due to the suction cup, my boy's head was a literal cone head and had a huge open gash in it. But no worries if that happens guys! Within 24 hours, his head was perfectly shaped and already healing rapidly. We had to stay at the hospital for 5 total days while our boy got light therapy in our room. This entailed laying on a tiny infant tanning bed with blackout goggles over his eyes. This was to get rid of the jaundice, which is basically a guarantee when the babies are taken out via the suction cup due to the necessity to heal the area.

I think that covers everything? It was a wildly intense experience, and partner agrees that if we decide to have another baby, she will get the epidural right away next time. I'm proud of her for trying it natural, but I'd rather not have to see her in so much damn pain and trauma again, so I'm thankful she said that!

Baby boy is happy and healthy, and we just celebrated him being 2 weeks old!

You mamas are strong, brave, and beyond amazing! Us guys are beyond lucky! All the best to all of you!",232,46,2021-08-02,birth experience

BabyBumps,"Getting an epidural/pain relief is not ""caving""","This is not a judgement or debate of epidural use per se, but I have seen a lot of rhetoric in birth stories that mom ""gave up, or caved in"" and got an epidural. 

So this is your unsolicited reminder that there is no trophy, reward, or congratulations for not getting an epidural. However you give birth is AMAZING and a triumph of womanhood. Tolerating pain itself is not strength, and not tolerating pain is not weakness. What you have been doing for NINE MONTHS is strength and power. Labor and delivery, with healthy mom and baby is GOALS; however you get there is a success. Your body, your mind (and medical staff) will guide you on how to manage the labor process. 

It doesn't matter that ""women have been giving birth forever""...a lot of things were deadly, more difficult, more painful before modern medicine. We utilize modern medicine for safety and comfort all the time--pain relief in child birth is no different. 

So whatever you choose in the moment to have the best experience is 100% the right decision.

Edit to add some thoughts and clarification:

I'll repeat the sentiment of something I just commented, taken from Emily Oster's *Cribsheet*. I think the reason we feel (stated or not) judgement or otherwise have strong feeling about one choice or another, is because we seek validation. We've each come to our own conclusion regarding the choices we make (this is more than just epidural or not), and when we naturally seek community and validation for that choice. So when we see others make the opposite, or a different choice, we may question ourselves, or otherwise feel this invalidates our carefully chosen decision. This may not be a rational, or conscious reaction, but I do think it is an underlying factor to why we debate these things; especially when these choices don't effect others. 

We are all inundated with a thousand decisions once we take on pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. I think these communities are largely positive: we offer advice and anecdotes to guide and support one another. Of course, our personal choices and biases will always find there way in, even if our better intentions aim to be neutral. 

That being said, for MY part, I'll make sure that to clarify that I have no intention to create a space for judging UNmedictaed births. My post was not for the person who may be making the judgement, but for the person who *feels* the judgement. 

We are all trying our best with what we've got. And since we have each other, let's be our best.",1496,435,2021-09-21,birth experience
BabyBumps,"FTM birth story. Not a positive experience, but a good outcome.","I gave birth a year ago, but I feel like I’m finally in the mental space to really understand my birth and what it meant to me. 

I went into labour six days overdue. Beginning labour was straightforward for me. I had no false calls, and when my contractions began they were steady. 

I began labour at eleven at night. My midwifes had told me that in the daytime call once labour began, so they could prepare, but not to call at night, unless my contractions were at 3-2-1 or I absolutely could no longer take the pain. 

The first few hours of labour were fairly easy. I would describe the pain as severe period cramps but with breaks in between, so not horrible. I spent most of this time in the shower or on the toilet. 

Around midnight or 1 am I tried to follow my midwifes advice of Tylenol, Gravol, and some sleep. The second I tried to get into bed it felt like being stabbed, and I staggered back to the bathroom. 

The next four or five hours were a blur. The only thing that felt good was being on my hands and knees with warm water pulsing on my lower back. I kept repeating my mantra and doing my visuals, and it did help a bit, as did timing my contractions. At this point I was bleeding a bit with each contraction. 

Finally I felt the baby lower, and it shook me out of my zen.  I realized that I was in too much pain to even call my midwife, and that if I waited much longer I would be in too much pain to even crawl anywhere. 

I managed to hit speed dial on my phone and wake my husband up. I told him to call the midwife. 

He got no reply twice, and I told him to immediately just call the back-up. Thankfully, she picked up on the first call. 

He put her on speakerphone at the edge of the tub. It was an incredibly frustrating conversation. 

I was trying to talk while in high amounts of pain. I couldn’t make her understand how much pain I was in. I would think I had explained myself, and then she would start talking while I was having a contraction and tell me to take some Tylenol and get some sleep. I told her I was so past Tylenol at that point, and she would suggest I take two Tylenol. Finally, after ten minutes of fruitless conversation, I felt the baby move again, and I knew I didn’t have time to keep explaining myself to someone who wasn’t listening. I agreed to everything she said, promised to stay home. 

My husband was very, very confused when I then told him to grab our bags, we were going to the hospital. I shuffled around bent over like an extremely old woman, threw on the first things I found, grabbed a trash can and headed for our car. At that point I started vomiting and had to crawl. 

I just focused on getting into the car. Once in the car, sitting was absolute agony. We live about half an hour from the hospital, and it was a horrible car ride. I vomited with every contraction, and was horrified to feel the baby lower with each vomit. I was terrified of not making it to the hospital, but we did. 

We get there, I get into a wheelchair clutching my puke filled trash can, with puke in my hair and on my clothes. We wheel up to a group of nurses chatting in the labour area. 

I kind of wait, because I don’t really know what I’m supposed to do at this point. They look at me, contracting in agony and covered in puke, and then go back to chatting. I’m not making this up. 

I feel awkward, but manage to weakly say, “Excuse me but I please need drugs.” Yes, I said please. 

They look at me again, and one nurse breaks off from the rest. She tells me I can’t have drugs, because they need to check me out first and make sure I’m in labour. Again, I am clutching a can of my own vomit and unable to walk because of severe pain at this point. 

She hands me a stack of papers to sign. This is where accounts differ. From my memory, I filled them out and then politely asked again for drugs. My husband says I actually just half-heartedly scribbled on the top sheet and then begged for drugs again.

At this point the nurse said, “First baby?”  I could only nod.

She then starts showing me different rooms like I need a tour. Saying “Hmm, we could put you in this room, or I think this one opened up.”

I wanted to say that at this point I’d give birth in the hallway, but instead just lunged for the first room. I was then told not so fast because I needed to put a robe on first. She handed me a robe and left. 

At that point I would have happily been buck naked, but I gritted my teeth and slowly managed to change clothes. I again just lunged for the bed, with my only thought being to get on and then I could maybe have pain relief. 

I angrily told my husband to go get the nurse because I had done as she asked, and I finally wanted some pain relief! He went to get her, but she was clearly in no rush. She came in, I immediately begged for pain relief. 

She said no, she needed to check where I was at first. She checked, and said that I was pretty much done, with just a lip left. 

I knew what that meant, and knew I wasn’t getting an epidural. She confirmed that I was not. 

I will say, the atmosphere in the room changed the second they knew I was that close. I stopped being belittled. In fact the nurse even chose to switch herself out, seeing that we had gotten off to a bad start. A new nurse came and hooked me up with gas and air. 

My midwife came and agreed I was too far along for an epidural. I just want to put this out here:  I continued to be in labour for three hours from this point, only fifteen minutes of which was pushing. There was time for an epidural. 

I wish I hadn’t used gas and air. I had no idea that they would take it away from me. I had started using it as a coping mechanism for my breathing, and having it suddenly take away left me very confused and disoriented when I really needed my head on right. 

Pushing was all right, except they kept trying to get me to look in a mirror while doing it. I remember thinking, I’m barely holding onto my sanity as it is!  I don’t think we need to add a visual component to this!  I could understand offering it once or twice, but I was offered it three times. Literally every five minutes. And I had to slip my concentration in order to gasp out a no each time. 

Getting the baby out was surreal. I felt like I had been beaten with a bag of sticks after, but at least I was no longer in complete agony. I held my baby while my placenta was delivered. 

Then she continued to assess me. And continued. And continued. I started shaking in pain. Every poke felt horrible. It certainly wasn’t as bad as the birth, but it made me feel nauseous with pain. I felt like I was going to go insane, I had no mental fortitude left to deal with this, I just wanted to not suffer anymore. She never explained what was happening. The shaking and clenching made me feel unsafe to hold my baby. 

Finally she called in the doctor for a suspected fourth degree tear. The doctor was an angel. She froze me, gave me gas and air, and explained everything she was doing. Turned out to be retained placenta, and everything was fixed up. 

I have extremely mixed feelings about my birth. I can’t in all honesty call it the best day of my life. In fact, it’s probably in the running for one of the worst. 

I’m in a weird place where I wouldn’t do it again just to have another baby, but I would do it again if I had to for my son.

So I’m calling that acceptance.",153,53,2020-06-03,birth experience

BabyBumps,"Late traumatic graduation post, a horrible situation that should never happen. TW","TW: Stillbirth 

I can't believe I'm posting this right now. I never thought I'd be in this situation. But I spent my whole pregnancy lurking here and in the pregnancy sub and after reading so many graduation posts I always imagined sharing the birth story of my son. I think both of our stories deserve to be heard. 

Loukas was due September 24th 2021. I had an uneventful pregnancy, every test and check up was perfect. I'm a 25 year old FTM, healthy weight, healthy everything. I did everything right. Always listed as ""low risk"".

At my 38 week appointment I brought up induction. I saw no reason to go past 40 weeks and just wanted my baby in my arms. In fact, I had a bad feeling in my gut about going past my due date. I tend to do a lot of research and reading so maybe I psyched myself out, but still, that gut feeling twists like a knife to this day. My OB (who is great) said that it would be a ""social induction"" until 41 weeks, meaning I'd be on the list after every other medical reason induction was cleared. I crossed my fingers and told myself to be patient.

At 38w +6 I got a cervical check in hopes of a membrane sweep. Nada. ""Sealed shut"". I kept being moderately active and hoped things would change soon. Two days later I started losing my mucus plug and 2 days after that I had light cramping off and on for 2 days and my bloody show. The timing was perfect and I started to get hopeful and excited. I did a big grocery shop and got everything around the house finished. 

At 39w+6 I woke up at midnight with definite contractions. I feel like it's important to note I had only been asleep for about an hour before. They were about 10-15 mins apart and painful enough that each one woke me up. Around 2am I realized they weren't going to stop and got out of bed with my contraction timer. I started half watching the (then new) Squid Game and tried to breathe through the contractions while timing them. They were still a little inconsistent, 5-8 mins apart, lasting 60-90 seconds but they never stopped and the pain was enough to take my breath away and have me gripping the coffee table like I was going to break it in half. I got so excited thinking that he would be here soon but I knew first time labours can take a while so I let my husband sleep. He got up around 6am and was very surprised to see me groaning through a contraction on the floor. I had an OB appointment already scheduled for 11am and I didn't want to go to the hospital too early and get shoo'ed away so I decided to wait and get checked at the appointment. 

Around 11 we headed to the appointment. At this point I could barely stand through the contractions and realized this was that dreaded ""back labour"" I had heard about. My contractions were still 5-8 minutes apart and SO painful but I could keep thinking and breathing through them. At the appointment, the receptionist took one look at me and joked that I should have gone to the hospital, she didn't want to be the one to deliver the baby. She took my BP (normal) and enthused that I'll be a mommy soon. My OB did another check and I was 1cm, 80% effaced. She finally did that membrane sweep and warned me that it would make everything amp up and that I could ask L&D for pain relief if needed. My husband and I went home but after a couple hours the spasms in my back got so bad that I couldn't breathe at times and I was yelling through the pain. I have a pretty high pain tolerance so this freaked him out and off we went. 

I'm going to cut out a bunch of details from here on because my experience at the hospital makes a mess of my mind. We got to the hospital around 3pm and I got hooked up to monitors. Baby looked good and OB on-call said I was still 1cm but 90% effaced. Loukas was kicking normally and knocked his monitor off, a healthy little guy. I had to stay I the outpatient area for about 2 hours because they were looking for his heart rate to do ""something"" (??!!??) before they could give me morphine. Morphine seemed like a good choice then because they said it might be another day before I could be admitted and at that point I was running on 1 hour of sleep with no hope of sleeping that night. My contractions were consistently 3-10 minutes apart for the whole time I was in labour and painful enough that even with morphine I was being woken up by them. I eventually got the shot and went home to rest. I would doze off for a few minutes and get woken up with so much pain I could barely breathe, then doze off again. Rinse, repeat. I ""slept"" like that from maybe 7pm-12am and spent the rest of the night watching Netflix and trying not to wake my husband up in case the contractions got more consistent or my water broke. 

Its now my due date. It was around this time that I started to get some aching in my hips, it was uncomfortable to lay on either side, so I spent most of the day sitting/standing/pacing to try to get through the contractions. I was in agony trying to pee and I blamed the back labour. It didn't burn like a UTI (although I've never had one) but trying to use that muscle group hurt so much I couldn't pee without making whimpering noises. It felt like the muscles in my pelvis were ripping apart. By 2pm we decided to go back to the hospital. My contractions were still irregular-ish but they wouldn't give me a break and I was screaming  and groaning in the shower trying to get through them. I figured I had made progress and I was exhausted. My husband was finally allowed to come up with me this time. I had (accidentally) cried on the phone to a nurse, breaking down and telling her how much I was suffering and in need of his support and advocating (I couldn't form words during contractions and the previous day they kept questioning me). We had a wonderful nurse, got hooked up again and figured we'd be admitted by then. Nope. Only 2cm but 100% effaced. I asked about staying to be helped along/induced but the admittance criteria was 3+cm or broken waters. There were 4 people ahead of me for medical inductions and this would still be considered a social induction so no luck. 

This is where the story gets hard. Not at the time of course, back then I was all excited and cheery even though I have never been so exhausted and in so much pain. My husband and I ended up being in the outpatient room for about 3 hours. They kept waiting for his heart rate to do that ""something"" again so they could send me home with another morphine shot so I could try to sleep. The nurse kept coming in and out of the curtain to check the monitor, and kept leaving. I was so exhausted I was falling asleep mid-sentence and being woken up by a contraction a few minutes afterwards. My wonderful husband held my hand and made jokes to get me through it. The nurse said she got what she needed from the monitor but wanted the on-call OB to check to be sure. She called our baby boy ""sleepy"". That word rips my heart out to this day. The OB came in with the ultrasound machine and checked him. We saw his face, his heart beating, he was practice breathing. She joked that he had such chubby cheeks. Then she pushed on my belly, hard, and rubbed him. His little hand waved and she said that he looked fine and that I could have the morphine shot. We left and stopped at McDonald's on the way home. I got a big chocolate shake knowing that Loukas would love it. Something about that word ""sleepy"" already didn't sit right with me but the nurse had explained that labour was tiring for the baby too and considering I had barely slept it was normal. I hoped the milkshake would give him a little pep and energy to keep being healthy. We got home, ate, and I did my painful pseudo-sleep from around 7-11pm. But this by this time my hips were in so much pain I couldn't stand to lay on either side for more than 30 seconds (we had told the hospital this). I ended up sleeping propped up on a recliner so I was practically sitting. I was awake and dealing with contractions until about 5am, when I managed to get back in the recliner for a few hours and doze between contractions until around 8am. 

It's now 40+1, contractions have been non-stop but the nurse last night had implied that if we came in the next day she'd find a way to keep us in the hospital. I spent the morning walking around the house and around the block to try to progress. At this point I'd been in labour for 50-60 hours and I could barely function from the lack of proper sleep. I couldn't even sit through the contractions because on the pain in my hips and back. I had to stand or lean on something most of the time. We had complete confidence that we would be admitted this time so we took care of the cats and such and I got so hopeful, I was still struggling to breathe through the contractions but I had a kind on second-wind mentally that made them easier to cope with. Around 2pm we excited left for the hospital and knew we'd be coming home with our baby. Fucking hell...

When we got to L&D's reception I saw the same kind nurse we had the previous day and she excitedly brought us to the outpatient area to be checked. I got dressed in the gown for the third time and she said she'd check me before bothering with the monitors so we wouldn't be in suspense. 2.5cms, 100% effaced with ""bulging membranes"". Then she got me to lay down and started hooking up the monitors. Right after she stared moving his monitor around my belly I had a bad contraction so I didn't notice when she started calling in back up. When I finally opened my eyes there was around 5 people surrounding the bed and one was the OB who was handing the plug for the ultrasound to my husband asking him to plug it in. I didn't understand what was going on and I was still in a lot of pain from my back spasming with the contraction. Suddenly multiple nurses were forcibly flipping me to my left side and then my right, I think they had asked me to first but I was in too much pain to move. It was so painful to be on my sides that I was yelling out, and at the time it didn't even cross my mind what was happening, I was just upset that they were hurting me and being impatient. Once they dropped me back to laying on my back, I opened my eyes and saw the on-call OB putting gel on my belly. My husband was already gripping my right hand and that kind nurse suddenly grabbed left hand and held it. I'm not a touchy person but I was still so confused, I didn't think anything was wrong. At first I was uncomfortable but thought ""how nice of her to try to hold my hand through the pain. Then it hit me. Everyone in the curtain was staring at the screen. I turned to the nice nurse and desperately asked ""is he okay?!?!"". She said ""that's what we're trying to find out"". I swear my heart stopped beating, I know I didn't breathe at least. After a second the OB said ""I'm sorry, there's no heartbeat"".

At that point my world collapsed. I wailed and sobbed. I couldn't stop screaming ""NO"" over and over. (Poor girl getting an NST in the bed on the other side of the curtain). I swear I had felt him kick on the drive over, it had been maybe 10 minutes since. I begged the OB to cut him out right there and give him CPR, I desperately looked around the room for something to cut myself open with so I could ""save"" him. They said they needed to confirm with an official ultrasound and suddenly they were wheeling me to the elevator to go to imaging. In the brief seconds I was able to open my eyes between wails and tears, I saw my husband helping guide the end of the end of the bed. I am so grateful for him, he cried but kept himself together enough to help move me around and if I hadn't seen him I think my heart would have stopped from grief right there. The official ultrasound confirmed no heartbeat. While we were there I had another contraction and I remember being so confused. For some reason I thought if something went wrong the labour would stop, I kept asking why I was having them and what was happening but no one answered. I ended up back in the outpatient area and lost every ounce of energy in me. My eyes were shut and I was limp. They took tons of blood from me and started an IV, I barely knew what was happening. At some point they took my bra off with my husband's help, I was so out of it I remember them asking but I couldn't reply or move. I was shattered. We got moved to a delivery room shortly after. 

I must admit everyone on staff was sensitive and so kind. This hospital has a delivery room specifically for losses and we spent our whole stay in there. At first my mind was spinning, I couldn't understand what was happening or that I was still in labour and about to give birth. I had to wait an hour or two until the anesthesiologist could get there and spent the time crying with my husband. So much of the experience is blurry in my mind, likely from the lack of sleep and the trauma. We were asked a lot of questions for medical history, nothing had predicted any kind of risk. I ended up with an epidural and spinal block and spent the night being induced and so numb I could barely move. They got a gurney and put it beside my bed so my husband could get some sleep with me. We took care of each other and he got some sleep. I spent the night awake, one hand holding his and the other wrapped around my belly, cherishing the last time I could hold my son inside me. When I would eventually doze off and my arm would relax and slide off my belly I would get jolted awake and hold him tight again. The 1-on-1 nurse we had throughout the night cried for us when she thought I was asleep. I am so grateful for her and her strength to answer the hard questions that kept popping into my head throughout that long night. 

By sunrise I was 10 cm and after about 20 mins of pushing Loukas was born. 8:54am, Sunday September 26th. 7lbs 2.6 oz, 52cm. Perfect in every way. I planned to keep my eyes closed and only see him once they had cleaned him up but I couldn't help peeking after his dad cut his cord. Full head of dark hair, that heartburn thing is a myth by the way. Another baby cried in another room and I had to cover my ears and beg for it to stop. I ended up with a few internal stitches, at least 4 but I wasn't counting. That uterus massage everyone talks about is really horrible, I couldn't help making noises from the pain. The local organization cleaned him up and took pictures, prints, and 3D castings of his hands and feet. I'm so so grateful for them, those memories are everything to me. We held him for about 4-5 hours but the hospital didn't have a cooling cot so eventually we had to let him go and leave (not at their insistence but our own acknowledgement). I have never loved anything in the world so much. Eventually I decided it was time to tuck him in for the last time in his little bed and I got up before the epidural had completely worn off. The only way I stayed upright was adrenaline and determination that I would not drop my baby. I forgot I didn't have a diaper or anything on, just the gown and a sheet under me, so I bled all over the floor and my poor husband had to call a nurse to deal with the mess and me. We left shortly after, I refused a wheelchair. Walking out of the hospital with a memory box instead of a baby is a horrible experience. By the time we got home I was in such shock that I couldn't stop trembling and no amount of blankets could stop me from being cold. I took a couple bites of bread and passed out.

The past two months since we got home has been surreal. Everything is still set up for him to come home any day. I still can't believe he's not coming back. I have 4 weeks of leave left and I'm still in no state to go back to work. I can barely eat or sleep and every day I feel like I wake up in a nightmare. I'm all 5 stages of grief at once. If it wasn't for my husband I wouldn't be here. I never thought this could happen. We're still waiting for the autopsy results, but my OB got the tests back from the placenta and said there was potentially an infection that was missed. I'm so angry about it all, what happened to modern medicine?!?! An infection? How did they miss that? But hopefully we'll get more information soon. I need answers. 

Thank you for reading this far. I don't want to scare people with our story, I just feel like my son's story needs to be heard. He was here and loved. I hope everyone can spend a minute loving the good boy he was too. Mommy and daddy love you baby boy, you didn't deserve this.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your kind words and support, if I could reply to you all individually I would ❤

Just to clarify: My whole labour process was from Thursday-Sunday and a total of 81 hours non-stop. The first part until I was admitted on Saturday night was latent labour but was likely stalling. I was in active labour for about 16 hours of the 81. I was 1cm at 11am on Thursday and 2.5cms when we got the news on Saturday around 3pm despite walking around a lot and getting some rest from the morphine. Once I was admitted and induced I was 3cm around 6/7pm and 5cm sometime around 3am. They manually broke my waters then (there was meconium but possibly from after he passed I think), and then I was 10cm around 8am. At one point in the night they had the drip so high I ended up in ""uterine asystole"" or something like that. It would have been bad for the baby but I told them if it wouldn't hurt either of us not to worry about it. 

Also to note: I am in counselling and will be investigating once all the info is back. I will post an update once everything is figured out but that might be months from now.",1538,246,2021-11-26,birth experience

BabyBumps,"To the horrified mother-to-be in front of the ER, my apologies...","I went into labor in the middle of the night, beginning with my water breaking. Just like my first baby, the people who tell you about 5-1-1 contractions conveniently leave out that you may never have that because your contractions START at 3 minutes apart.  

It's so hard to know how your pain compares to someone else's, but the contractions were bad enough that by the time I arrived at the hospital that I was not in a good spot. My husband drove me to the emergency room (thanks, COVID, for adding this extra step), let me out, then went to park the car, so I was on my own briefly. 

Due to it being the middle of the night, there was no one outside to help me. I wasn't entirely in my right state of mind and it didn't occur to me to GO INSIDE. So I stood there, yelling, panting, leaking through my pants, and then promptly vomited copiously all over the sidewalk. 

A kind voice says, ""Um, do you need help?"" Without looking up I nod and hear this voice say angrily to her partner, ""Go get someone now! I can't believe there is no one to help you!"" Finally a man appears with a wheelchair to take me in and I look up to thank the woman. I cheerfully say, ""Thank you and sorry about that, I'm in labor!"" The woman blanches white and her mouth opens in horror. That's when I realize she, too, is pregnant albeit probably about 6-7 months along. 

So, sorry for that, mama-to-be. I'm wondering if you pictured a peaceful, serene birth scenario with low lighting, soft music, and your partner by your side. Sometimes we just vomit in front of the ER instead.",1879,257,2020-05-24,birth experience

BabyBumps,"Fainting birth partners - your experiences, how did you manage?","My fiance, the father of my baby, wants to be my birth partner, which is lovely... BUT, he has a phobia of blood, and has a history of gagging/heaving/vomiting or fainting when confronted with blood. 

Have any of you had a birth partner like this and how did you manage it?

I want to brief my midwife that if he starts to gag/heave, take him out before he vomits, because I hate the smell of vomit and don't want to have to smell that while in labour. I've told him directly, if you vomit, clean it up and leave.

If he faints I am concerned he will hit his head and do an injury? He is 6'4"" so it is a fair height to fall from. Or what if a hospital staff trips over his body and hurts themselves? He weighs about 230lbs so they wouldn't be able to move his body from wherever it falls. 

What have been your experiences with fainting birth partners and how did you prepare for or handle it? I have more or less accepted that the practical support will be minimal. I might as well bring a mannequin in for support lol. Emotionally it will be nice that he is present, albeit unconscious. 

Yes I have spoken with him about it and his response is just ""I will hold my shit together, and not vomit or faint"", which is quite uncharacteristically lacking in self-awareness for him. My understanding is that vomiting and fainting is involuntary.",24,35,2021-10-14,birth experience

BabyBumps,Unpopular opinion (?): wanting/talking about an unmedicated vaginal birth is not an insult to those who choose an epidural! It’s not okay to flip the roles and shame or mock those who choose to try and go all natural (and “all natural” is also not an insult!),"Ive never seen anyone here bashing choosing epidurals or c sections, and quite a few comments are encouragements to not to give in to the “pressure” to go unmedicated. 

But any time I see natural being brought up I see people commenting “it’s not a pain competition” “you don’t get a trophy for going natural” or “I would highly suggest getting an epidural anyways!!”

Why is that okay? Imo and in my experience it seems to be projection. Women who have had epidurals laugh and mock sarcastically with “good luck 😂” when someone says they don’t want one as if the person who doesn’t want an epidural thinks they’re better or don’t know it’ll be painful. And the whole “oh, so was my epidural vaginal birth a ✨sUpErnatural✨ birth or something??” reaction, acting as if saying “natural birth” is an insult and not just *an appropriate term for natural unmedicated vaginal birth*. It’s not a personal attack! 

Talking about *not wanting an epidural* is not an insult to YOUR choice to have one! 

The reasons people have to go natural are not stupid, or unreasonable, or insulting, or mean they have a superiority complex, or any of the other ridiculous accusation I’ve seen across social media (not just reddit).",845,441,2021-11-03,birth experience
BabyBumps,I gave birth in my car today and I cannot believe I'm actually typing it,"
Disclaimer: I'm not good at writing my thoughts or experiences, so I will do my best! I'm trying not to make it confusing. That being said, this happened yesterday and I wrote everything after this statement yesterday. Enjoy! 

28F/36 weeks/TTM with a baby boy, no issues leading up to this day. 

Everything was smooth sailing up until I had a hard time sleeping last night with just discomfort. When I woke up this morning things were painful but it felt like round ligament pain so I decided to get dressed, get to work, and assume I'm over thinking it and at work I'll get my mind off it. 

Then the waves start coming of the cramping, intense but irregular. I manage to stay on my feet working as a retail manager throughout this. It's hard though and getting harder.  The day goes on and I'm able to help guests, clean and care for the animals albeit at a very slow slow pace and with a lot of gut wrenching pauses due to the pain. 

By 2:30 I can't take it and I drive home to grab my husband. I'm in 10+ pain/discomfort contractions driving home at this point, STILL hoping they're not real (guys, I'm an absolute imbecile). 

I get home, rush him to leave with me and he's on it. We're in the car and every 30 seconds I felt like I am DYING. I start to need to push with the pain. I hold off while trying to avoid throwing myself out of a moving vehicle with the amount of pain I'm in. 

We're in the car for maybe 4 minutes and I HAVE to push. There I push, terrified and screaming and instantly my water breaks. 

30 seconds after that I really really REALLY have to push. If I held off my body probably would have done it for me, which is a wild feeling. So I push, my body pushes (sounds weird but that is the best way I can say it) and lo and behold a tiny head is emerging in to my pants that I'm simultaneously trying to take off to be able to support that head. My husband is still driving because this all happened in the time it took to wait at a stop light.  

My husband and I are in total shock and having to act so fast. There is a head in my seat between my legs. It can't stay stuck there. 

Am I not suppose to push non stop? Will his shoulders dislocate if he comes out wrong?! Will he not be able to finish coming out? Is he alive? What irreversible damage is happening!! So many questions, so much fear, we have no answers but have to act. Luckily we park seconds after the light turned green. DH gets out after dialing 911 coming around to my side. While talking to them he is managing to also orchestrate how to safely deliver the baby. One more push and he's out. This is at a gas station with my just-birthed vagina spread for all to see in the parking lot. Fortunately the baby cries after DH taps his back and we hear sirens as the paramedics are coming. My poor husband ended up having to go in to the gas station to wash his hands from all the delivery liquids. I couldn't imagine being him at that moment lol. 

There's cop cars blocking off the parking lot and the ambulance blocks our car so I can get on the stretcher with some privacy. I have to get on the stretcher half naked and umbilical cord still attached so thank good for that. 

Then they took us to the hospital and it was all over with. The awful, terrifying, agonizing pain and the fear for the baby's health and safety. 

Turns out it all happened so fast because my placenta erupted/tore at some point before this all happening. I have no tearing and I feel great all things considered. 

Baby is 6lbs 11oz. and healthy and for being early he has cleared all tests and screenings. It all worked out in the end. My DH was our literal life saver and I'm so thankful for him and for how all of this turned out.

BabyBumps,Anyone else dreading birth based on their IUD placement experience?,"Years ago I decided to get an IUD. It ranks in the top 3 most painful experiences of my life, just below an ovarian cyst rupture and breaking my hand. I nearly passed out. The nurse who was assisting the doctor said that's what I could expect a contraction to feel like if I were ever to have a baby. They had even given me cervix-softening meds and ibuprofen to take an hour before the procedure. The removal a few months later (due to terrible mood & skin side effects) was also incredibly painful, but only made it into the top 10 most painful experiences of my life.

&#x200B;

That was about eight years ago and I still remember it vividly. Ever since then I've doubted whether or not I wanted to birth a child. Now I'm 12 weeks pregnant and still am doubtful of my ability to push this baby out of my body. Was the nurse just underestimating my pain? Are having contractions really so painful for some women that they nearly pass out?

&#x200B;

My hospital doesn't do voluntary c-sections so that's only happening in the case of an emergency. I am planning on an epidural, but have read a few recommendations that you should wait as long as possible to get it so that you can stay mobile in the early part of labor to keep things moving along. But I am worried I wouldn't be able to stay mobile if I'm feeling on the verge of passing out every time a contraction comes on. So I'm coming to you all to see if anyone else had an exceptionally painful IUD experience and later went on to birth a human without passing out.",31,39,2021-02-13,birth experience

BabyBumps,"Graduated! 27 Feb at 37w6d, Natural unmedicated birth experience in Japan.","cross posted from my monthly bump subreddit.

Notes: Japan has been really strict with hospital regulations due to covid. No one is allowed to accompany me while I'm labouring in the hospital and only one support person is allowed in at the very end when I'm moved to the delivery table. This person also cannot be from out of the prefecture without self-quarantining for atleast 2 weeks. Hubby and I are living separately at the moment due to his work and I'm at my inlaws so I get help while pregnant and postpartum. He comes visit every 2 weeks and just so happened to be around when baby came.

Got woken up by contractions at 7.30am on 27 Feb. Didn't know they were contractions at first. I just felt an intense pain that felt like I needed to poop. Sat on the toilet for a while riding out the pain but not being able to poop before I realised this was different and saw blood when I wiped so I figured it was go time since my mucus plug came out a couple days before and I'd been feeling all sorts of cramps for a while.

Hobbled my way back to the bedroom and groaned so loud hubby woke up and immediately got to work calling the hospital. Hospital opens at 8.30am so we were told to come in then if we could wait or come now if the pain was unbearable. At this point contractions were 10 minutes apart and I felt that we still had time so we chose to take things slow and even got McBreakfast along the way because PRIORITIES. 😂

Finally arrived at the hospital at 10.30am and as expected, hubby was turned away and told that he would be contacted when I was dilated to 8cm. I was then ushered to a room that would be my home for the next week to change into the hospital gown and underwear. They served me lunch and I then was left alone.

About an hour or 2 later, I was riding out contractions when I heard and felt a pop and a gush of liquid came out. Kinda like how a heavy period would feel coming out when you sneeze. Pushed the call button and a midwife came in to check. I was then moved to another room specifically for labouring and given some kind pill to take to prevent infections before being left alone again.

Around 2.30pm the pains were getting severe and the midwife came in to check and found that I was dilated to 5cm and told me I was progressing really fast for an ftm. They then gave me special permission to call my husband in since at this rate we'd be having a baby within the day. Also, the family home was about 40mins away from the hospital so they wanted to be sure he could make it in time.

Good thing they did because less than an hour later I was fully dilated and moved to the delivery room. Hubby was shown in with a face mask and an additional face shield.

Japan isn't all that big on pain meds and the midwife outright gave me a wry smile and ironic laugh when I asked about an epidural. The hospital doesn't have an anesthesiologist on staff at all so no happy-dural for me. The only ""aid"" I was given was oxygen as baby was stressed out while I was pushing.

For what it's worth, Japan seems to have a ""natural is best"" kind of thinking. Most local hospitals will not offer epidurals or have an NICU equipped. You're better off traveling toa larger university hospital. Elective inductions are also rare and elective c-sections and pretty much unheard of unless deemed a medically  necessary. 

Laboured on the table for about 30mins and honestly the pain was so much I felt like I was going to have the biggest poop of all from all orifices at the same time. (I checked with the nurses and I didnt poop the table at all though).

Baby ripped her way out at around 4.30pm and I was in so much pain that I didn't even feel her come out 😅 hubby had to tell me to open my eyes and see her before they laid her on me. 10 fingers and 10 toes perfect in all her grey raisin-looking glory.

I had to have a couple stitches and I definitely wasn't prepared for the ""massage"" they gave me to help push the placenta out. That honestly felt more painful than contractions 😂

There wasn't anyone else ""queueing"" for the delivery room so hubby got to stay awhile longer with us and they delivered dinner to me while I was still at the table. Couldn't move though so hubby ended up eating most of it.

Hubby was then made to leave once I was deemed recovered enough to move back to my room. I'd only see him a week later when I got discharged.

Hospitalisation postpartum in japan is generally 5-6days for natural birth and 6-7 days for a c-section. They teach you to breastfeed and how to bathe and change baby. How to cosleep (it's common in japan. They even call it the river style sleep because the character for river is 川 and looks like a child sleeping between parents). They also come in to check my blood pressure and temperature every day and make sure I've pee-ed and pooped and how many times. Also countless belly massages and boob massages to make sure my uterus is shrinking and my boobs are producing milk.

A week felt like a long time to be alone but I appreciated the quiet time to recover and bond with baby. I squeezed in time to embroider the little sign while in the hospital too as Japan has a tradition to announce the birth and name of baby at 7 days after birth (Google 命名式 or 命名書). Traditionally it's a calligraphy sign but hubby was doing that and i wanted to make something as well.

The hospital also has esthetic services and I got a nice facial and foot massage too. Also, the [food](https://imgur.com/gallery/5H0BC7W) is really good.

Baby was on the small side (2650g) for being born 2 weeks ahead of schedule and slightly yellow with jaundice but her levels were barely below the benchmark for phototherapy so we were allowed to discharge on schedule with orders to come back in a few days for a checkup again.

It's been slightly over a week since then and I'm recovering fairly well. Baby is also gaining weight and her bilirubin levels are slowly but surely going down too.

Sorry for the long post and weird formatting if any as I'm on mobile. Here's to a new journey as a family. Please feel free to ask me anything with regards to the birth or even about cultural practices in japan.",72,25,2021-03-10,birth experience

PregnancyUK,My rebound baby trapped me,"Hey guys I don’t even know where to start because things are such a mess.

I met a woman not long after my 9 year relationship ended it was all fun at the start we partied and had lots of fun all the time, she knew it was a casual relationship and i was still hurting over my break up. The novelty wore off and it realised I wasn’t really attracted to her once the rose tinted glasses come off although she was a nice person. 
Things started to frazzle out and I was about to end things and try to go back home to my ex.
But the new woman had stopped her contraception on purpose because I think she realised things were fading ( i only know she stopped it on purpose because her friend told my best mate ) by the time I found out it was too late.

So now I’m still with her because I don’t want to upset her by leaving after getting her pregnant because she was adamant from the start she was keeping it ( obviously because she planned it without me knowing ) I don’t even love this woman she’s wanting us to move in together but I don’t want too even though we’re now in a proper relationship. It’s taking me 5 months to actually come to terms with the baby even though I’m still not 100% yet.

I’m trying to make things work for the baby’s sake and maybe one day I’ll love her but it’s so hard because I’m not even attracted to her even though I know it’s not al about looks. I’ll be 100% there for the baby but I don’t know how much longer Incan carry on for acting like things are fine between us, she moans if I ever want to go out with my friends yet she was happily doing it every weekend all weekend when we start got together and now it’s like I’m not allowed a life of my own. 
She’s not the person I want to be with I still haven’t got over my 9 year relationship I just don’t understand woman who want to purposely get pregnant so very early on in a relationship that she knew was only casual and I know I should have used my own protection but I thought the pill would have been enough as my ex never fell once whilst on it but little did I know she actually stopped taking it.

She’s a nice woman and we do argue sometimes but she’s just not a person i want to spend my life with although I’m trying to make it work but I know I can’t force something

Has anyone got any suggestions or maybe been in a similar situation? I feel like I can’t leave her now because I wouldn’t want to cause her any stress during pregnancy and I know she loves me,it’s been 10 months that we’ve been together now and still no love feelings towards her.",2,24,2021-05-20,stress during pregnancy

If I stay in my current job I'm guaranteed 26 weeks full maternity pay + statutory. If I take the new job I won't qualify for maternity pay but could get maternity allowance (I think). 

If I stay in my current job I will be less stressed and can focus on my pregnancy, and apply for promotions in a few years. This feels like a sensible and stable choice. If I take the new job I'll have some awkward timings of starting in a few months but then going off on maternity in the Spring. Also starting a job with more responsibility will be more pressure and is that just too much when you're pregnant? This feels like a much bigger risk and threat to my wellbeing in one way. But perhaps my wellbeing will be more adversely affected by not going for it and reaching my potential.

So difficult, but feel I can't really talk to anyone since it's so early along. Also worry that I could potentially miscarry and reject the job worst case scenario. Interested to hear any and all views. If you've changed jobs during pregnancy I'd love to hear your experiences too. Thanks for reading!",7,20,2021-07-26,stress during pregnancy
PregnancyUK,"Ftm here- anxiety regarding scans, going in alone","Hello, got my first scan coming up in the next few weeks and I’m extremely anxious my husband won’t be allowed in with me. I am very squeamish, I don’t like people touching my body - experience of rape has made me very uncomfortable with unnecessary touch.. I’m stressing out with the thought of having to go in alone for scans and examinations with COVID restrictions 

What’s everyone’s experience with this? Have you been allowed to bring someone with you from the same house hold? Does anyone else suffer with this same fear during pregnancy with people touching you? how do you deal with it?

PregnancyUK,"Birth story - vaginal at 40+1, FTM, induction, no epidural, precipitate labour, 2nd degree tear, SGA","I really enjoyed reading birth stories during pregnancy - particularly UK based ones, to get an idea of how things work under the care of the NHS (Barts Trust for me, in London). 

So, here’s mine - it’s quite late given that I gave birth in early May! It’s long, but I wanted to include details of things I was curious about when I was pregnant. 

# Background

For the most part, my pregnancy was low risk and pretty ordinary. I have PCOS but avoided developing gestational diabetes, and did well physically with the pregnancy until around 39 weeks, when I developed excruciating hip pain. That said, I did end up being induced for medical reasons. 

At the two routine ultrasounds at 12 and 20 weeks, a cyst was spotted on my right ovary. After the 20 week scan, they offered another scan at 28 weeks to check on it to see whether it had grown or not. I was pleased to have the opportunity to see my baby again, and not *too* phased by the cyst as no-one seemed particularly concerned about it. 

28 weeks came (finally! The 20-something weeks dragged for me) and the cyst had shrunk, which was great news. Unfortunately, when the sonographer measured her, she was quite small - on the 10th percentile. My understanding was that this wasn’t necessarily bad: it could be that I just make small babies. But, we scheduled two follow up scans to keep an eye. 

At 32 weeks, she measured 25% percentile which felt great! Then, at 36 weeks she was 50% percentile. At first this seemed like a good thing, but did make my husband and I wonder why her size was so all over the place. Ultrasound measurements are notoriously inaccurate, particularly as the pregnancy gets towards the end, but we were still worried.

I had an OB appointment a couple of days later, and we discussed the situation. The OB was similarly concerned about the trajectory of the percentiles 📈, and the strain that would put on the placenta. He recommended induction at 40 weeks, due to risk of placental insufficiency. I accepted, and we booked it there and then at 36+4. I had been keen to go into labour spontaneously so I felt quite mixed about it, but found that I was more accepting of it than I had expected. I'd done my homework and knew induction might be proposed, and knew what it might mean. Obviously I didn't want to have an induction for no reason, nor have a longer, more painful labour! But I felt like if there was even a slight risk of her not being okay due to going beyond term, I thought that whatever happened during the induction would be worth it. I asked about why her growth may have accelerated so much but he didn't have many ideas: we did a blood test to check again for gestational diabetes (I had done the glucose tolerance test at 28 weeks), but it also came back negative.

Still keen to go into spontaneous labour, I got my midwife to try and give me a sweep at 38 weeks. Unfortunately, my cervix was closed so she couldn’t do it. She told me the baby was quite low though, which felt encouraging. A week later we tried again at 39+6, but my cervix was still disappointingly closed.

At this point, I knew my chances of spontaneous labour were basically none. On the positive side, it meant my husband and I didn’t have to be stressed about timing contractions, when to go into the birth centre, calling an Uber, or making a mess/giving birth in it! We could have our last night at home as just the two of us.

# Induction

At 39+5 we had gone to the hospital for our covid tests, though we didn’t get to find out the results until we turned up for the induction. We had been super careful the whole pandemic and even more so during my pregnancy, so we were reasonably confident they’d be negative. Thankfully they were! We were also very lucky that the covid restrictions at the hospital around induction had changed two weeks before, and my husband was allowed to be there for the whole thing - as well as come and go as needed.

I arrived at the hospital at 9am for my induction, without my husband - we had a leak in our flat (great timing!), and a workman was coming over to see if the wall had dried out. We figured we probably wouldn’t be meeting our daughter for days, so it wouldn’t matter that he wasn't there immediately. 

I was admitted around 9:50am, surprisingly into a private room off to the side of the induction/postnatal wards. I think this was because I had a birth partner coming, and it was safer from a covid perspective to be separate. In any case, I was not complaining! A midwife showed me where to make tea/coffee and get water. I settled in and tested out the wifi, it sucked. My husband asked if he should come now as the workman had gone, but I said to stay home until after he ate lunch because not a lot was happening yet.

Some midwives passed by to take some blood and get things started. It wasn’t a good start - they failed to get blood from either of my inner elbows, so they then tried my hand. It was super uncomfortable - when one of them said they’d try that vein next after messing up the 2nd inner elbow, I was skeptical. In retrospect I wish I’d just asked for them to try elsewhere. My hand was bruised for a really long time afterwards.

I got hooked up by a midwife around noon to a machine to monitor the baby - baby was doing great. Alex did a cervical check and it was still closed and needing to thin, so she inserted a pessary at 12:48pm to get the induction going - it was the worst one by far, very painful and unpleasant. I ate some lunch (somewhat sad mac and cheese) and played some Switch. My husband left home to come around 2pm, and we played some of our Stardew Farm together and generally chilled out. 

I was due to get more baby monitoring around 6:30pm, though with the changing of the midwives it kept getting put off. My husband went home to eat dinner and sleep around 7pm - since we didn’t know what was going to happen, it felt sensible for him to be as well fed and rested as possible. Napping on the floor beside me probably wasn’t going to be fruitful, and the cafe serving food was closed to non-staff members because of covid. At this point, I tidied the room up a bit, as my stuff was everywhere. This wasn’t a room I could stay in to give birth - I would need to be transferred at 4cm to the delivery suite upstairs.

# Labour

I was finally hooked up to the monitor around 8pm. Around this time, things were starting to ramp up pain wise. Baby was still coping well with the contractions, which was a relief. An hour later however, I was not. I had breaks between contractions, but even with that I was starting to find it difficult to cope with - so I buzzed for the midwife and asked for some paracetamol and tried to take a nap. It didn’t manage that nap, and it didn't help with the pain. I buzzed again, and I asked for something stronger.

The midwife, Eva (who was amazing), suggested dihydrocodeine and I accepted. I took it around 11:45pm. The codeine didn’t help either, so I asked for help again and Eva brought gas and air. That didn’t help either, and she suggested we remove the pessary and do a cervical check to see where we were at. I felt like things were really ramping up, so whilst I waited for Eva to come back I called my husband and told him he should come. I needed his support, even though I felt guilty for taking away his sleep! I thought, given the frequency and intensity of the contractions, that I’d be 4cm and moved room soon.

Eva removed the pessary at 0:40 and did a cervical check, and I was 2-3cm and fully effaced. I was pretty deflated - in so much pain, but not yet even in active labour. I tried to remain calm, as I knew that getting stressed or panicked about it would be counterproductive. I messaged my husband to tell him the news, and felt a bit bad he was coming when nothing was really happening. I then accepted a pethidine (& anti-sickness) injection - I felt like I really needed a break from all the pain and intensity. I had originally not really wanted this pain relief option, but I discussed it with Eva - she said the baby was doing well on the monitor, so she wasn't worried about it causing any issues. I had hoped it would help me relax, perhaps sleep a little or at least conserve some energy, and that would allow me to be in a good place for everything to come much later on. I started a message to my husband explaining about the potential side effects and how I felt okay with them, but was in too much pain to ever finish it and hit send - the draft was still there when I next went to message him after giving birth!

What I did not expect was the injection to still not give any pain relief. Contractions were so painful, and it was a lot - I was vocalising (aka shouting) through them. My husband arrived, and I remember thinking he must have been in for a shock seeing the state I was in, given how chill things had been when he left (he said later from my phone call he knew roughly what to expect). My waters then exploded - it felt very weird, but did give me a little relief. Eva re-checked on my progress, and I had gone to 7cm in the last 30 minutes 😲! She then started to try and get me moved upstairs to deliver, but there were no rooms free - she knew I had to go soon, so made it happen somehow. 

I don’t remember a huge amount about the transfer, I was in so much pain and already pushing involuntarily. Someone took the mouthpiece off the gas and air canister I’d been using, and put it in my hands to squeeze during contractions. Someone kept telling me to stop pushing and of course, I couldn’t. Someone kept telling me ‘well done well done’ (though I didn’t know what for 😅). My husband was behind the bed, laden with all our crap - a car seat, wheely bag for me, a couple of backpacks and all our snacks (we packed enough for 4 days 🙈!).

# Delivery

At 1:52am we were upstairs and we were handed over to midwife Alice. As she was setting up for delivery, my husband showed Alice our birth preferences - though really most of it seemed irrelevant now. I remember thinking how pointless it was when he asked me if I should - I had wanted to keep mobile, try different positions and be in water for pain relief etc, but it happened so fast I got none of that! I was glad we showed her them though, she took the time to read everything and did take what she could into consideration. Alice then examined me at 2:15am and found that I was 10 cm. In retrospect, I must have been in transition whilst we moved - 0/10, would not recommend. 

In the brief calm before we started pushing, Alice explained that if anything happening was concerning and she needed to escalate the situation, she would hit the emergency buzzer behind my bed and the room would flood with people. Whilst it was scary to think that was a possibility, it was strangely reassuring to know there was a process in place in case the situation required it.

I started pushing, and at first, the baby was dealing with it well. It was hard going, I was pushing as much and as hard as I could. It was difficult to gauge whether or not it was going well. I kept going, trying to focus on pushing. I was on my back, which wasn’t something I’d wanted, but was in too much pain to really care/try and move too much. After a while, I remember hearing vaguely that the baby was starting to show signs of distress, so Alice hit the emergency buzzer and the room was filled with people just as she said. I heard someone mention an episiotomy. I knew things were really getting serious and slightly scary, so despite feeling like I was already pushing as much as I possibly could, I pushed even more. The amount of pain and pressure was intense, I just tried to focus on getting her out at all costs.

At 2:27am, our daughter was born - 2.76kg (6lbs 1oz)! I had pushed for 11 minutes 😲. The pressure build up on top of all the pain had been so intense, it felt amazing that it was all gone! I asked if she was okay because I couldn’t hear crying and wasn’t sure - thankfully she was fine, with an Apgar score of 9. I then asked if they’d given me an episiotomy, as I had no idea if it had been needed or not! They hadn’t, there hadn’t been time, but I had a second degree tear. I had skin to skin, delayed cord clamping and my husband cut the cord. 

Delivering the placenta was rough, it took seemingly forever, even with the injection. One of the doctors who had come when the emergency buzzer was pressed came back to help, she and Alice were discussing options of what to do if it didn't come - this wasn't something I knew anything about, so I was quite apprehensive. Thankfully it came just in time, so no intervention was needed.

After this, I just needed stitching up and it would be all finished! Unfortunately, this didn't go very smoothly either. Alice was recently qualified (I found out later I was the third person she ever sewed up!) so she wanted some support to do them (very reasonable, I preferred she did it with help). However, it was a very busy night, so she struggled to find help. Meanwhile, I'm lying on my back worrying about what state my tear is in, trying not to fret about what I felt like was a gaping wound. It was so stressful. I tried not to move much, for fear of harming it somehow. While I was waiting, Alice asked me if I wanted to hold my daughter again, but I didn't - it felt too overwhelming, too difficult to do so. So I told her to give her to my husband instead. I felt a bunch of guilt about this, but preferred that to awkwardly holding her whilst not really able to do so. Plus, it gave my husband the opportunity to do some skin to skin with her - which was great.

Two hours passed, and finally Alice found a friend to support her with my stitches. They changed the bed up so my legs were spread in stirrups, and was elevated so they could operate at a convenient height. It was very odd, I felt super exposed. The stitching took a lot longer than I had expected - 40 mins or so. I had thought it would be about 10. Ultimately I had zero complications with the stitches, so they did an excellent job - it was just a shame the circumstances around this, on top of a long placenta delivery, made it horrible.

# Postnatal 

The hours after this were up and down. I vomitted a lot. Dinner from the day before, breakfast from the day. It was gross and annoying, but not the end of the world. Our daughter was safely here, it hasn't been too bad, and we would all get to go home soon! Or so we thought. To go home, we needed to be transferred downstairs to the postnatal ward, and then they could discharge us. 

At 3pm (11.5 hours after giving birth!) we were finally transferred downstairs, and around 5pm, a midwife told me I have to stay for 3 days because the baby came out small and they wanted to monitor her. I felt betrayed. I sobbed, so, so hard. My husband then had to leave because ward hours are 9am-5pm. I'd just been through so much, and yet was alone on a freezing cold ward with a newborn to care for.

Later on, the night shift midwife passed by to introduce herself. She asked how I was doing, and I burst into tears again. She made me a cup of tea, sorted out the temperature, and then sat in the corner of the ward doing her paperwork throughout the whole night - I am forever grateful, I felt so much less alone. Over the night, I did the best I could, trying to get to grips with breastfeeding. I changed my first poopy nappy without getting poop on anything, and felt like a superhero! A couple of hours later I had my first post-labour poop, which was surprisingly fine!

The next day, I asked every midwife I saw as well as the doctor who did my daughter's routine tests if I could go home yet. The midwives said only the doctor could get me discharged early; the doctor said she didn’t have that kind of power. Eventually, one of the midwives checked the guidelines around babies who were born small for their gestational age (SGA) and she found that keeping someone for 3 days was if the percentile was 2nd percentile or below - my baby was 2.2 - so I got her to discharge me, and went the hell home. It was such a relief to be home, and be able to feed and care for her with the support of my husband, rather than alone.

# Reflections

I had a birth experience discussion with a midwife from my hospital last week, to help me piece together some of my experience - it all happened so quickly a lot of it was blurry. Overall, I feel very lucky for my birth experience. It had bad parts for sure, but I didn't come away traumatised (maybe that’s a low bar? 😬). 

Looking back at the postnatal experience, I can understand the midwives wanting to be really certain a smaller baby was doing okay (any baby, really). The situation would have felt 100x less awful if we’d been informed of the situation from the start, not so late in the day. Another option would have been to let us go home, and then come in each day for any extra checks etc. It was totally awful at the time, but in the end it was just an extra day in hospital - it could have been much worse.

I did absolutely loads of research about labour, birth, hypnobirthing etc whilst pregnant, and the thing I took most away from it all is how unpredictable it all is. As someone who likes to be prepared, this is a scary prospect! But I found it to be manageable - in the days before my induction, I was sitting on the sofa reading the NICE guidelines to understand the process, what options might be presented, etc. It definitely helped me feel happier and more in control of the situation. It’s also funny how what you want can and will change. Early on, I really didn’t want an induction. But when it turned out that was on the table for me, it was an easy decision and I’m glad I chose to do it.

I don't have any big regrets - though I do wish I’d asked for my placenta to be sent to pathology to satisfy my curiosity, and find out if it did have issues.

# Now

We’re about 3 months later now. The intensity of the early days was higher than I had expected - the lack of sleep was about what I figured it would be, but that on top of finding breastfeeding very hard… it was a lot. I didn’t expect to be feeding 6+ hours every day for so long (even now we’re usually at least 4.5 hours every day), nor how that would impact my mental health. I had known that breastfeeding might not work out, but I didn’t know it might not work out because it was so challenging (I thought it would be more of a binary “works” or “doesn’t work” I guess?). I had no idea it would be such an emotional rollercoaster either. I remain a little bitter than neither of the breastfeeding courses I took whilst pregnant mentioned this, lol.

I didn’t bond with her from the start - I thought that might be the case, so I gave myself some grace and time to get there. For a long time I never thought I’d have or even want to have kids, but hey here we are. Parenting is relentless so far, but it’s incredible to see her grow, change and learn ✨.",63,4,2021-08-06,stress during pregnancy
PregnancyUK,Really going wrong,"I’m so sorry but this is a rant. So I’m in for my induction today and my partner didn’t come because he has a swollen back. For months I said I should pick a backup person and he said no because he’ll be there. And now I’m just panicking in a hospital crying. To top it all off he’s just messaged to say he had to put one of his pet birds down and went into extreme detail. I’m a sobbing mess, I’m scared, and honestly at this point I don’t know what to do. I do wish he was here but I don’t really want to talk to him any more.

Update: 
I’m not sure if anyone will read this but I wanted to say thank you, you’re encouragement helped a lot. I was moved to the labour ward this morning after a panic attack. I didn’t think I could do it and was going to wait but the midwife told me it would decrease my daughters chances, so I womaned up and went in. I was still freaking out and managed to sort a back up person after the long attempt to get a cannula in my arm (it did take multiple tries and I’m not gonna lie there was a lot of blood). After that my waters were broken and I started having contractions. The machine that registered them was not picking them up but I was in so much pain I was screaming. I was offered an epidural and I did want one however they couldn’t pick up her heart beat anymore and had to put a monitor near her head. Just before this with each contraction I started pretty much screaming “I need a shit”. They went to put the monitor on and realised I could start pushing. From then it was about 20 minutes of pushing. The whole process only took an hour. I didn’t get any drugs in the end because the gas and air didn’t agree with me and the others they had prepped too late. I couldn’t have done it without the amazing team of midwives and I’m kind of thankful for not having a person I knew there, it proved to me that I could do anything. So if anyone reads this and is going through induction, or doing labour alone, you can do it, I believe in you, and I know it will go just as well for you as it did for me ❤️❤️❤️

Extra update:
I even cut the cord and tbh that felt great too ❤️❤️❤️

Ps: 
This isn’t pregnancy related but I wanted to remind you guys because I forgot. after you’ve given birth trust your instincts. My daughter wasn’t feeding and only 2 midwives took my concerns seriously. She went from a freezing screaming but very sleepy baby who couldn’t fill a nappy, to a warm content bubba after some formula. I felt something was wrong and had to talk to over 10 midwives before someone saw my concern and saw she was dehydrated. The second midwife helped even more and now the two of us have even slept a lot more which is making us less stressed. Please trust yourself a before, during, and after birth, and remember midwives are there to help, even if it takes awhile to find one who will fully listen ❤️❤️❤️",5,15,2020-11-09,stress during pregnancy
PregnancyUK,A POSITIVE BIRTH STORY DURING THE PANDEMIC,"Here goes my first reddit post...

I was pregnant and due to give birth in the midst of the global pandemic. Everything was uncertain and highly stressful. Appointments were cancelled and the prospect of giving birth on my own was slowly becoming a potential reality. Despite all of this, I was determined to have a positive birth experience.

I am sharing my story in order to spread positivity around childbirth and hopefully encourage other women who may be feeling nervous about labour and birth. 

It was no doubt an extremely challenging and perplexing experience but also magnificent and transformational. I am definitely not the same woman I was before I gave birth. 

Let me share our story… 

It was a warm sunny day on the 10th June and I had come home after a long walk with my husband; I was one week “overdue”, feeling heavy and keen to get the show on the road. The week that followed my due date were the most bizarre days of my life. It felt like my whole world stopped. Every night I would go to bed anticipating labour but instead I would wake up to even more messages which read “have you popped yet?”, “do we have a baby?”. In the end I sent a blanket message kindly telling everyone to give us some space and that the baby will come when the baby is ready. I needed to tell myself this too as I was becoming impatient - searching ‘how to induce labour naturally’ all day. Strange that one can patiently wait for 9 months but becomes frantic during those last days (I definitely made it to the 20th page on Google!). 

After the walk we got home and flopped ourselves on the sofa and I secretly prayed it wouldn’t happen that evening as I could feel my body aching. 

A few minutes later, I felt a wave go across my stomach. The feeling was unrecognisable. I didn’t have any Braxon Hicks during pregnancy and so had never felt this sensation before. I knew straight away that it was the start of labour. Suddenly, I felt wide awake. This was the moment we had been waiting for. I turned to my husband Tom and said - I’ve just felt something. I think it’s happening. His face beamed and being the practical one he started listing out all of the things we needed to do - check the hospital bag was packed, get the snacks and cold items from the fridge and set up the bedroom for labour. 

We were so giddy and excited. Finally, we were about to meet our baby girl. The feeling is indescribable.

I insisted that we should remain calm and carry on as normal for as long as possible. I knew early labour could last a long time so I didn’t want to peak too early and use all of my energy. We started watching a cooking program to take our minds off it and a few minutes later I felt another wave. It wasn’t painful at all but rather enjoyable, the feeling that would eventually bring our baby into this world. I decided to embrace the sensation and make friends with it as I knew it was going to get stronger as the time passed.

About an hour went by and I could no longer sit down so I leaned over the sofa and started to rock and sway, the movement really helped me go with the sensation rather than sit there helplessly. 

As the time passed and the contractions built in intensity, I decided it was time to go upstairs and get in the zone. I wanted to be in a dark quiet room. 

Tom made a little bowl of sweets for me and put them upstairs. The pain intensified and so I got in the shower and started stomping my feet and watching the water splash against my toes - this really helped distract my mind away from the pain and I loved the warm water on my body. I was also using a lot of sound to help release the tension, lots of deep ‘AAA’ sounds each time the contraction would come in. I felt so in touch with my primal self.

In the moments between contractions I would pause and breathe, collecting myself and preparing myself for the next one. I can’t remember what exactly was going through my mind at that time but all I know is that I was fully focused on the present moment. Looking back I think this really helped me because I was only focused on getting through the next contraction and I wasn't thinking too much about how long my labour was or how far I was. 

Very early on it became clear to me that although I had my husband's support, this was very much my experience on a physical level and nobody apart from myself would be able to do this. I also felt intuitively that having Tom near me counting my breathing was not right, it was too distracting. I needed to focus and find my inner strength. I didn’t even need to explain this to Tom, after 11 years together he knows me well enough to know what I need without words. He quietly made himself comfortable in bed. I took this as a sign of his belief in me.

To manage the pain, I was in the shower for a while stomping and smacking my palms against the side before getting out and leaning over the birth ball whilst rocking back and forth. I had the duvet over my head and body as I leaned over the birth ball. I remained naked so that I could easily hop back into the shower when I needed to, my naked state also helped me be vulnerable, stripped bare - the state I needed to be in to birth my child. 

The most effective tool I found to manage the pain was using sound. I always thought I’d be calm and serene and not make a sound but this honestly felt so counter intuitive. I used sound to manage the sensation and be one decibel higher than the pain. I felt so powerful and primitive. 

For me the sensation was unlike anything I have ever experienced, there is so much power and force behind each contraction and I think seeing the ‘pain’ as powerful really helped me to take charge of my labour. The pain was coming from within me, and so could never be stronger than me. 

It got to around 5 in the morning (labour started at 7pm), and I started to feel as though I wanted to give up. I remember feeling tearful and like I had used every ounce of my energy and had nothing left to give. At this time I was also feeling a powerful urge to bear down but kept resisting it as I didn’t want to have the baby at home!  

Tom then phoned triage and the receptionist asked to speak to me, as he passed the phone a contraction came in and I couldn't speak. I had to vocalise the pain. After hearing me, the midwife then advised that we come in straight away.

Tom called a black cab and I was on all fours “mooing” as we sped down to the Whittington Hospital - I just remember the cabbie saying “don’t worry darlin! We’re nearly there”. I must say at this point I was in a bit of a daze as I hadn’t slept the full night but even in this state I never left the present moment. I think this is why my memory of the day is so vivid. 

We finally got to the hospital and I limped to the reception desk and started giving them my details. The next contraction came in and the powerful urge to push returned. The midwife could hear from the sounds I was making that I was wanting to push. She then said ‘excuse me lady are you pushing?!’, to which I said ‘Yes!! I can’t help it’. She then rushed me into a room to assess me. She propped me up on the bed and after checking my cervix she looked up at the other midwife who was positioned behind my head - I could make out a surprised look in her eyes (she was masked up and so I couldn't see her full expression). “She’s fully dilated, get her to the birth centre now”. At that point I heard Tom burst into tears outside. 

I felt exhilarated as I knew that meant that the next step was pushing the baby out and we were closer to meeting our daughter. The midwife then wheeled me over to the birth centre whilst singing ‘we’re going to have a baby!’. We were so exhausted but the adrenaline and excitement was keeping us both going. 

We got into the room and I said I wanted some gas and air. After taking a few hits I started to feel really spaced out and high and started singing Bob Marley 3 little birds! Tom and the midwife were both laughing at me. At this point I didn’t have a care in the world, I think realising how far I had progressed gave me a real buzz and almost made me feel as though I had done it.

I decided then that the gas and air was more of a distraction than a help so I put it to one side and got back in the zone. I had my birth audio track on in the background and could make out the words ""you are mother, you are creator” with an OOMMM sound in the background. These words were incredibly helpful.

I was pushing for around an hour and half before the midwife asked me to change positions and move to the birth stool. I remember feeling as though I wasn’t letting go of the baby and I thought if I’m going to get this baby out I need to LET GO with my every being. It was as though I needed to open my heart and soul. So with the next contraction I truly let go with every ounce of my being. Juniper was then born. They lifted her up and into my arms. I can’t say I felt the rush of love that everyone talks about but what I did feel was a sense of wonder. I can still see her face now in my mind, with those big inquisitive eyes staring back at me. 

I think about that day time and time again. I felt so powerful, to bring new life into this world. I think the mental prep I did ahead of the due date really helped me. I speak about my birth preparation journey on my podcast which I record in my spare time as a new mum (aka when Juniper is napping) - give them a listen if you have the time! I also share personal experiences throughout my motherhood journey which is in some ways even more challenging than the birth itself.

PregnancyUK,Wake newborn to feed?,"Sorry, I know this is a pregnancy sub but I couldn’t find a UK specific sub for new parents so I’m hoping there are some second+ time parents in this group.

In the BabyBumps sub I’ve seen multiple references to people waking their newborns to feed if they sleep for longer stretches of time. This seems completely counter-intuitive to me, and even though I’m a second time Mum myself I can’t remember ever coming across this advice in the UK. I’m wondering if any UK parents have been given this advice by their NHS doctor? Or if this is perhaps a US viewpoint?

My completely non-medical opinion is that surely if the baby’s body needed food more than sleep they would wake up?! Are there any studies or research that contradict my (completely unfounded) opinion?",12,44,2021-11-24,birth weight
PregnancyUK,False negative? Please advise!,"Hi there. I need help haha. Now I know the first answer is always and should always be ""go to the doctors"", which I appreciate, but for reasons I'll get into, it's not that simple.

Me and my girlfriend had reason to believe she'd fallen pregnant. She presents with textbook symptoms, even her own family members have commented on it and asked her if she's pregnant. Her breasts and stomach are definitely enlarging, she notices it and so do her female family members.

Edit: more about her symptoms. She has back pain, she's sleeping way more than usual, she has that metallic taste in her mouth and she is eating way more than she usually does and even things she hated previously like chocolate.  Cheese in a weird sauce too and also pickles, lots of fuckin pickles. 

We left it a while, it's been about a week and a half/two weeks since we assume the conception happened. It could have been one of three times, within a reasonable time frame of each other. The first time likely being 2-2 and a half weeks ago although I could be wrong. 

We went out and bought a test last night, a Clearblue double pack, ya know those digital and analogue ones? Both negative. Analogue one had a fine control line but it came with a negative line upon opening so that one may have been a dud, fuck knows.

She has hormonal issues, and only really got into puberty proper at the age of 17, doctors thought she'd never menstruate yet she does. She has issues with her thyroid and weight as a result of that. Not downs, but chromosome issues as well. She's beautiful don't get me wrong, it's an internal dna issue not one that presents externally. (not that it'd matter! Love is love) she has irregular periods, so timing it was out of the window. We also used the first morning urine as you're supposed to. Poor girl held it in all morning! 

We've done some reading and it turns out there are many.. Many ways a false negative can happen, right down to how she physically handled the test. I couldn't be in the room at the time, as its a small toilet and my were parents around. We're overage, 20 actually, but we imagine pregnancy would be a shock to them so we're keeping it quiet until we definitely know.

It did cause some worry and stress tbh, she cried to me and i stg it almost set me off too. We really want this baby and tbh we're both still worried a bit so we'd like some advice as to how to proceed. She has severe anxiety issues that prevents her from going to the doctors alone. I will be going with her at some point, however when I don't know as it'll take some convincing. 

Please no judgment on age. I don't want to hear about ""living my life first"", because honestly it'll just stress me out more than I already am, so thank you. Answers relevant to this question only please! :) 

(also relevant: she has a potential internal prolapse also. Not sure where, even she isn't due to her lack of keeping appointments due to anxiety which I understand but is frustrating as I'm worried about her health. TMI but you can definitely feel it in the rectal passage, so I assume it's there and hopefully not womb affecting.)

So sorry for this schizo rambling, I'm just incredibly concerned about the girl I love and our potential child. Thank you for any help!

Trigger warning eating disorder 

Hello. I am currently 9 weeks pregnant and had my first midwife appointment last week. I was advised I would need consultant led care because of my bmi (37). During this conversation the midwife called me clinically obese and a risk to the baby. I explained this is highly triggering for me (past ed 5years ago, and weight focusing was a trigger for depression after last baby). 
I understand the need for extra care, however my last pregnancy had no complications and I gave birth naturally (bmi 35) and nothing was ever mentioned about a consultant. 
I eat healthy and exercise at least 30 mins a day plus see my PT once a week. 
I’m worried this negative focus on my weight which I was quite happy with, is going to trigger depression/ED behaviour.
Does anyone have any experience with consultant led care and how they found it?",3,21,2021-09-12,birth weight
PregnancyUK,How is everyone preparing for labour / delivery?,"Morning all! I’m 30+1 and had my growth scan and follow up appointment yesterday that pretty much confirmed I’ll be booked in for an induction for vaginal birth in about 6 weeks.

We’re having mcda twins (identical boys) so 36 weeks is about the norm it seems, both are head down and no complications, both ever so slightly above average for height but both weights exactly where they should be. 

I’m a FTM so this is all very new, I was for sure expecting to be told I need to have a csection (very aware this could still happen and completely okay with it, but want to be as prepared for both options if I can). I’ve already done a lot of csection research so feel a little more confident about how to prep for that, but a vaginal birth was not something I thought I’d be allowed to do, so now I’m lost. 

I’ve tried to read up a little last night but there’s just all this talk of teas to drink to induce, foods that bring on contractions, perineal massages that sound terrifying, so I figured the advice from other mamas would leave me less disoriented. 

Is there anything I need to really research, anything specific to ask my consultant (I have a mixed bag of professionals involved; obstetrics, midwives, twin specialist consultant, and cardiologist as minor heart condition), or anything about being induced I need to keep in mind? Birth plan is pretty much done but now I feel like I need to amend it!

As always, any and all advice appreciated!",6,21,2021-07-30,birth weight
PregnancyUK,Postpartum exercise question,"I realise this might sound vain or silly but the reason I'm asking is I've always had body image issues, the past year has been the hardest ever mentally, I'm feeling increasingly ""big"" and ungainly and I feel like the only way I can regain some semblance of control is to plan ahead to ""get my body back"" postpartum. So, sincere apologies if this seems flippant - it isn't, I'm just feeling very low on self-esteem atm :(


So, the question: Assuming a fairly straightforward vaginal delivery and a reasonable level of fitness pre-pregnancy (weight training 2-3x/week, pre-Covid cycling, swimming, walking), what's the best way to ""ease in"" some exercise routine postpartum and how best to time it? I know most sources agree on waiting at least 6 weeks until picking up more vigorous exercise such as jogging again. How about walking? Would it be safe to e.g. walk an hour in the morning and again an hour in the evening (after taking care of baby, napping etc.)? I always assumed swimming would be a very good way to get back into exercising postpartum, as it does not place so much stress on the body - but could chlorine present in swimming pool water affect breastfeeding?

If anyone has any books, websites, courses etc. to reccommend, I would be very grateful! I will of course talk to my doctor/midwives about this, but I really wanted to start piecing some kind of rudimentary plan now to fend off my anxiety. 

Sorry again if this all sounds overblown and many thanks in advance!


Edit to clarify: I've never had an eating disorder and I don't intend to push myself too far, I have an average body and just want to get healthy and fit.",11,22,2021-03-10,birth weight
PregnancyUK,Advice needed - 36 weeks pregnant and low BMI.,"Hi there, I’m 36 weeks + 2 days pregnant and I’m not looking for medical advice per se, I’m just looking for advice on whether I should mention this to my midwife?

Has anyone had low BMI and if so did you have anything different with your treatment and stuff from the midwives such as seeing consultants/dieticians or having certain tests etc? I’m a bit concerned that I’m underweight and haven’t been having any extra tests or anything. 

I’ve had the same midwife since the start so she wouldn’t have noticed anything was written wrong in my book at all, but my mums friend noticed it today and has made me panic a bit. Low BMI can lead to low birth weight/premature birth and other complications, and being this far along has scared me since I haven’t even discussed my birth plan yet. Also according to Google I should’ve been instructed to put on 13 - 18 kg by now and obviously that hasn’t happened. 

I was having bad heartburn and headaches this morning so instead of going to my normal midwife my mum called her friend who’s a lead midwife (a lot more higher up than my normal midwife), she came over and took my blood pressure which was fine but she noticed my BMI was written wrong in my green book and was a bit concerned. My midwife has written my BMI as 54 (which should’ve raised flags as that’s not normal) but that was actually my weight in KG. My actual BMI is 16.5 which leaves me very underweight. She was asking about consultants and tests I’ve had but I haven’t had anything outside of the normal blood/urine tests every two weeks. Is this normal? If you were underweight did you have any tests or did you see a consultant/dietician about anything?

I’m asking as I have my bi-weekly check up tomorrow and I want to know if I need to ask my midwife about anything specific. Thanks in advance!",2,12,2021-11-08,birth weight
PregnancyUK,Twin stroller travel system options,"Hey so I posted about this ages ago and got some words of wisdom on how other expecting mamas were prepping, which was really useful, but now I need to actually get stuff done!

We’re expecting our twins in 9 weeks, we’d initially thought we were buying fixed car seats that rotated for ease (i.e joie 360 ispin), and that we’d just get a compact lie flat double stroller (i.e baby jogger double) that was suitable from birth and move the babies around as necessary… 

…That’s all gone completely out the window and we now understand that detachable car seats that are light weight and efficient, and that can just snap on to a double stroller for ease of not waking sleeping babies when moving them between the car and the stroller - is by far the more sensible option. 

Issue is I can’t for the life of me find a side by side double stroller that can have two car seats attached to it at the same time that both face parents and not outward to the world, with car seats that connect to an isofix seat base!

Now of course we could just buy the bugaboo donkey duo or twin but brand new that will cost us £1300/£1500 (plus the car seats), and whilst money isn’t necessarily an issue, it would genuinely grieve me to pay that much. I know we could get a bundle deal second hand for a decent amount less but we’re still looking at £750-£1000 for a second hand one and the car seats, and I don’t know how I feel about buying second hand car seats either?? 

So basically I’m just hoping someone has some magical option I’ve not yet considered that could be an option we explore?

I’d wanted to buy the joie isnug car seats as they’re only about 3kg in weight and only cost about £150 each for the seat and the isofix base for the car of which I think is quite good? Issue was of course that I couldn’t find a double stroller that fit the bill as such with having adapters for those specific seats whilst still being side by side etc. 

If anyone has any recommendations on a side by side that accepts two car seats (and which car seats are actually compatible) we would be eternally in your debt and forever grateful! This is a pain in the butt and I feel like I’ve checked every website in the galaxy but to no avail!",1,14,2021-07-07,birth weight
PregnancyUK,Care and advice,"I was wondering if anyone knows of orgs/charities who can provide general advice and emotional support on concerns related to pregnancy?

I'm having a low risk pregnancy but I've had things come up that have been psychologically kind of challenging to cope with. After having a great booking appointment in one city, I moved and had a booking appointment at 19 weeks within a new trust. The midwife didn't listen to me, took down a lot of my info wrong, was very insensitive about my mental health history, and shamed me about my BMI being ~26 (up from 24 pre-pregnancy). I ended up making a complaint and while I received a letter apologising for her tone and poor communication, they obviously bent over backwards to justify her focus on my weight and claim that it constituted an adequate standard of care. Then a couple of weeks ago I wound up in triage because of light spotting and had a stressful experience of being repeatedly examined (causing more bleeding) and a junior doctor freaking out about a cervical polyp. After an ultrasound that showed everything was fine with baby and placenta, they wanted to do a colposcopy, but I put my foot down and asked to have it after the birth because I didn't see that there was a good reason for further intervention at this stage. The doctor was very understanding and agreed to this. But no one has spoken to me about returning to exercise (I strongly suspect exercising a bit too vigorously caused the spotting) or sex or really given me any aftercare. I have a midwife appointment coming up but it seems ages away at this point.

I understand both these incidents as a consequence of the present crisis in maternity services, but I guess I'm wondering if there is anyone I can speak to (with a more expert background than my friends) who will be able to provide a sympathetic ear. I have had private therapy in the past, but cannot afford it right now, and I know the likelihood with NHS counseling is that I will be on a waiting list for some time. But I don't think I'm looking for anything as in-depth as therapy, in any case - I'm not depressed, just feeling isolated. Any ideas?",1,9,2021-09-17,birth weight
PregnancyUK,Is it possible (safe) to lose my muffin top in my first trimester? (I’m a size 14 now),"A little backstory is I’ve just found out I’m pregnant for the first time! I’m 23, when I was 15 I was diagnosed with a rare muscle disease called dermatomyositis, because of this I had to go straight onto steroids & methotrexate, the steroids made me go from a size 10 to a size 18 within 4 months. I had always been a chubby child and struggled to get rid of puppy fat so I remember being distraught I had to go on them. I came off around a year later and took another year to lose all the weight. I had to go on several times since but unfortunately it left me fatty love handles and a muffin top, stretch marks in most places (which I don’t really mind now) cellulite ect at only age 17, since then I’ve been on and off a few times and luckily managed to keep the weight off. My body had a weird change though last year, I lost my dog from childhood and overate everything it was a horrible traumatic experience with my abusive mother who I was trying to gain custody of my dogs from. In result I gained another 3 dress sizes, I managed to knock off a dress size last month, but this month I’ve found out I’m pregnant! I’m just so upset though I’m so happy, I just can’t help but think of all the things I’ve missed out on and always nearly having the chance to feel good about myself is always met with something that makes me gain weight again, but I always thought I had more time to tone up and change my main worry is that I’ll just look terrible after giving birth because my body had a traumatic stretch in my teens, my developmental years :(

I would love to get some advice from you lovely ladies who have had similar experiences ! Is it possible and safe to tone up my muffin top / belly fat at the first trimester? So I would have a better chance of preserving my skin and preventing distortion? If it’s not safe I will deal with what comes with motherhood, I would never put my baby in harm ! Any advice at all is so welcome! Thankyou in advance! ☀️

PregnancyUK,Midwife Concerns: Update,"Big thanks to everyone who responded to my post a few days ago about my lovely but mistake-prone midwife, it was great to get so much advice and reassurance 😊 Thought I would post an update now things have moved along.

I called the GP practice I had been going to who told me they only had one midwife and they couldn’t advise me on what to do. Not the answer I was hoping for! Decided not to give up though and tried calling the local birth centre instead and they were fab! Really lovely on the phone, completely understanding and have switched me over to their care as of now. Feels like a huge weight has been lifted! I also think it will be great to get to know the midwife team there now as, all being well, I’m probably going to be giving birth there too.

So, thanks to everyone who encouraged me to have the awkward conversation! I think I would have stuck with the midwife I was unhappy with if it weren’t for all the reassurance, but I’m in a much better place now 😊",44,4,2021-04-29,birth weight
PregnancyUK,Incorrect Weight Listing,"Morning all!

Some of you might remember my posts about my mistake prone midwife. Well, despite having left her care now I’ve found another error! I had my first scan yesterday and so was given the birth chart thingy with projected growth on. I didn’t realise at the time but when I got home I noticed that my initial weight had been listed as 51kg. I remember from the early appointment with my midwife that when I stepped on the scales they showed 56kg, as I’d measured 55kg that morning on my scales at home, so she’s taken off nearly 10% of my weight. This makes it look like I’ve put on an extra 5kg between then and now, when actually I’ve not put anything on yet. I’m really concerned this has affected how they worked out projected growth or how things will be monitored moving forwards as I could end up under what I should be and issues could be missed.  

I worrying over nothing? 5 kilos feels like a lot to be over/under to me (I haven’t been that light since I was a teenager!) but is it too small for there to be issues? Or should I speak to someone about getting my chart/record changed?",1,8,2021-05-15,birth weight
PregnancyUK,[Update] - Pram advice needed - disabled mum,"[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PregnancyUK/comments/kwmqct/pram_advice_needed_disabled_mum/)

First let me thank everyone who gave advice on this one! It was all massively useful, and we picked our travel system after lots of research, a Mamas & Papas personal shopping experience and yet more research. I thought I'd post some info here in the hope that it's useful for other disabled mums.

We looked at quite a few systems before we decided on one. The initial must haves for me were:

&#x200B;

* Light enough for me to lift one handed
* Easy to put up and down one handed
* Easy steering
* Travel system

After trying a few we changed our criteria

* Light enough for me to lift one handed
* Easy to put up and down
* Easy steering
* Good height from the ground to minimise bending
* Easy to adjust handle
* Lasts until at least 1 year, preferably until 4 years
* Brake is a lever across the pram instead of a separate one for each wheel (didn't realise how hard this would be on my bad foot until I tried separate ones at M&P!)
* Easy to attach/detach carrycot.

At M&P we were offered to try the Airo and the Strada when we gave this criteria.

The [Strada](https://www.mamasandpapas.com/collections/mamas-papas-strada) was a nice looking travel set, but it was way too heavy for me (Pushchair: 10.4kg, Carrycot: 4.9kg), and the travel set was really beyond our budget (the set they tried to sell us was over £1200) so that was out straight away.

We then tried the [Airo](https://www.mamasandpapas.com/collections/mamas-papas-pushchairs?_=pf&pf_t_model=FILTER%7CModel%7CAiro). This was lighter (7.6kg) but the chair/carrycot section was really low to the ground! The height wasn't something I'd thought of before, as a FTM I assumed that it would be a standard height for most prams/buggies, but this was only 23"" off the ground, and would be impossible for me to lift baby in and out of during a flareup, let alone after birth if I need a c-section or my PGP is aggravated, so while light and fairly stylish with decent steering, that was out instantly. I also found the adjustable handle really difficult to use (twist the handle to unlock, then lift/lower to adjust). As my husband is so much taller than me, and I have arthritis in my hand, I realised this would be a deal breaker for me as I'd always need his help to adjust it. The other prams that M&P had in store were a lot heavier, so we left it at that. It came with a carry strap, which sounds useful, but that's a lot of weight to have across your shoulder and not great for balance.

We did go to John Lewis, to try a few of their prams, but nothing really caught our eye, and they were all either really heavy or prohibitively expensive. I can't remember all the brands we looked at, but the Bugaboo Fox2, Egg2 and an iCandy, but they were all too heavy for me.

We had a look at a few more online. The Cosatto didn't have enough information on the website about the weight of the chassis/carrycot and was again quite expensive once you added the bundle on, it's a shame, I loved their fabrics (Mr Fox!).

/u/hurricjayne recommended the Ickle Bubba Stomp V4 in the original thread, so I spent some time comparing their different models on the website.

The Aston Rose looks great but was a whopping 11kg - way outside my limit. The stomp range is all 7.1kg and the lightest sturdy system I was able to find. We eventually found a [Stomp V3](https://www.icklebubba.com/travel-systems/stomp-v3-travel-system-with-isofix-base) on offer at Smyths for £444.49 and went to check it out. Out of all the prams my husband and I tried, this is the one we both agreed on.

What I like:

* Lightweight
* Easy to put up and down two handed (I realised that being able to do it one handed wasn't a deal breaker, due to the ease)
* Sturdy but easy to steer
* Lockable wheels for rougher terrain - easy to lock
* Brake bar rather than separate ones
* Decent size basket (a lot of the ""lightweight"" prams sacrifice on the basket area)
* Aesthetically, I love the leather effect handle covers, it looks really smart. They are removable for washing.
* Doesn't take up too much room -  we opted for a pram with a carrycot instead of a moses basket so I can easily wheel my boy to different rooms when I'm having a flare.
* Good height - I can easily see in the carrycot from the sofa
* Carrycot can tilt - great for nappy changing when I can't get on the floor or stand at a changing table, and I know he's safe and isn't in danger of rolling off anything
* Carrycot frame converts to seat later on, so all we have to do is keep the cushions safe instead of having an entire seat sitting around
* Carseat and carrycot are easily interchangable for quick visits to the shop etc.
* Handle easy to adjust with a good range of heights - plus it folds right down to save space in the car

What I didn't like

* Instructions could have been a bit clearer. It comes with a huge manual but 90% of that is foreign language. There was a bit of trial and error in putting it together, but I've had harder ikea builds to be honest. I was able to put the majority of it together on my own at 34 weeks pregnant, my husband had to help with the unpacking due to the bulky/heavy packages.
* Isofix carseat was a bit of a bugger to install, but I think that's partly due to the way my car is. My dad ended up helping me with it, and it took a bit of faffing to get it in, but now it's secure I'm quite happy.
* Canopy feels a bit flimsy, and trying to put the raincover over it is an exercise in frustration as it falls down, but I think that's something that will come with practice for me.

Another thing I didn't like is that I tweeted the company for the carrycot mattress dimenisons so I could buy some sheets (the cover is washable but I'd rather have a soft sheet for easy changing) and they never got back to me.

Overall, I'm really pleased with it though! Now all that's left is for my little boy to arrive so I can actually use it!",15,4,2021-05-21,birth weight
PregnancyUK,Baby measuring small (3rd centile) at 26w5d,"I went in to triage on Tuesday because I hadn’t felt baby move as much for a couple of days. Baby’s heartbeat measured fine but when they measured my bump they said my fundal height is much smaller than it should be. I was measuring 21cm at 26w5d when I should be between 24cm-28cm (from what I’ve read online this puts him at around 5 weeks behind where he should be). My measurement was so low they couldn’t plot it on the grow chart because it only starts at 23cm. They took me for a growth scan straight away where they confirmed baby is measuring small but the fluid around the baby and the bloodflow to his brain look fine.
These were the measurements:

Abdominal circumference - 204mm

Head circumference - 247mm

Femur length - 46mm (she initially measured this at 43mm but on the 3rd reading said it was 46mm)

Estimated fetal weight - 789g

They confirmed baby is only just over the 3rd centile. I’ve read online that anything under the 10th centile is a concern but other than that I don’t really know what any of this means.

I’ve got another growth scan on 9th February and they’re trying to book me a consultant appointment for afterwards. I don’t really know what to expect going forwards but it’s hard to imagine his growth could catch up that much in the space of 2 weeks. Anyone else had a similar experience or know of anyone who has? Even if the outcome isn’t looking great we want to at least be a bit prepared with questions for the consultant.",10,8,2021-01-29,birth weight

PregnancyUK,"Polyhydramnios, Gestational Diabetes and big baby at 95th centile at 33 weeks.","Hi everyone,

Just finished my growth scan today and I was told I have Polyhydramnios, I was already diagnosed with GD at 28 weeks and now this. My GD is not really the issue according to the consultant/doctor as I'm still on a controlled diet, I think it's because my husband (Caucasian) side always have big babies on their end.

To give some context I'm Asian and very petite. Before pregnancy I was 7.5 stone and my height is 4'11 1/2 not even 5'0 lol. I didn't gain a lot of weight during this pregnancy and the reason why I'm tested for GD is because my dad and grandad both have diabetes. It came a shocked but I've learn how to deal with it and control my sugar in take. 

Today was really a shocked for me and hubby as my bump is round but not that big, it looks normal to be fair. But after the scan omg this boy is chunky.

Here's the fetal measurements:

Amniotic fluid index: 27.2 cm, normal is 5 to 24 cm

EST fetal weight 5 lbs 7ozs (97th centile)

Abdominal circumference 391.1mm (95th centile)

I just need some tips if anyone had experience this. I've read that growth scan can be way off but still this is making me anxious.

I have a very bad heartburn and indigestion and now it all makes sense why. I'm also always tired and breathless that's some of the symptoms of Polyhydramnios. Today I'm 33 weeks to be exact and I'll be monitored closely but still have no idea about their birth plan for me. They just said your baby is big. I have an appointment with midwife next week and another growth scan at 35 weeks. 

If any mums out there have this experience and have any tips on how not to worry please let me know. 

This is my first time having a baby and this quite overwhelming. xxx",6,5,2021-05-13,birth weight
PregnancyUK,FTM Graduated 18 Jan (37+5) | IUGR planned induction to emergency caesarean,"Crosspost from my bumper group.

Overall positive birth but difficult hospital stay due to COVID restrictions.

I've been getting regular ultrasounds since the discovery of a fibroid near my cervix at the 12 week appointment so they wanted extra monitoring of the baby's growth and whether vaginal delivery is a possibility. Since the first scan I've mentally prepared myself for a caesarean and anything other than that will be a bonus. We found the fibroid has moved at the 21 week scan and they continued to monitor me every 4 weeks just to make sure it is clear of the birth canal. At the 36 week appointment the sonographer measured baby girl at 2% growth weight and the obstetrician scheduled CTG and blood flow scans to make sure everything is okay. All the tests came back normal and he is positive we won't have to do an induction at 37 weeks and reassured me that ultrasounds are not 100% accurate and since all the other factors are normal, he isn't worried and we can re-evaluate at 38 weeks. They will bring me in again next week for another round of CTG and blood flow scans to monitor me. However at the 37 week appointment, even though the tests came back normal, midwife consulted with a doctor in the delivery suite, she said due to small birth weight we should schedule an induction as soon as possible and they booked me in for an induction in two days time. I was definitely shocked by how soon it all was, I had planned to ask if we can delay the induction until 38 weeks. The hospital's policy in cases like mine is for a 37 week induction, so we decided to go ahead and we want the best possible outcome for our baby girl.

Went in on 37+3 to get started on the pessary at 11pm and I was already 1cm dilated during the cervical check (super uncomfortable) which gave me high hopes that we should be able to kick start labor in 24 hours. 24 hours came and went, still 1cm but cervix had moved forward, then at 2am I noticed a small gush of liquid, didn't feel like my waters, turned out I was bleeding. Midwife said it could be my bloody show and nothing to worry about unless the bleeding continues but she monitored the baby's heartbeat just in case and baby was fine. At 5am, I noticed bleeding again, cervix is now at 2cm and I can be transferred to the delivery suite, have my waters broken and call my husband to come in.

Initially, I wanted an unmedicated birth with laboring in water with gas and air but due to the bleeding, water isn't an option and I also wasn't allowed to eat because of the possibility of a caesarean. I mean my whole birth plan went out the window the minute they said induction so what's another wrench into the plans? Husband came shortly after they broke my water at 625am and it was so comforting to see him after the 30 hours ordeal in the induction ward. I opted for an epidural after two hours of contracting, I just couldn't mentally and physically handle it, especially when the midwife said they expect 2 cm dilation every 4 hours and we could potentially be there until next morning. I noped the hell out of that, hoping I can at least catch some sleep with the epidural (spoiler: I didn't) I barely slept a wink since the night of the induction. Epidural was pure bliss, it took some time for it to run through my body but it made everything just wonderful, I even love the catheter, not peeing every hour had been so great. By 1.50pm I was 6cm dilated, making more progress than expected but around this time baby's heartbeat's base level had increased and there were concerns. Doctors came in and extracted a small amount of blood from baby's head for testing at 230pm, it came back normal. By 4pm, baby's heartbeat is still all over the shop so the midwife checked my progression, I was still at 6cm. Around 5pm, I started to feel a bit rough but I wrote it off as lack of sleep. The midwife wanted to test my temperature again because she thought something felt off, we cannot thank her enough for her due diligence, my temperature was at 38.1c and they now suspect an infection which could explain why baby's heart rate had been so irregular. Sepsis was confirmed and now I need an emergency caesarean. I was nervous and worried but because I had been preparing myself for a worst case scenario, I was surprisingly calm and just let the team get on with it. The whole surgery team was so chill and was chit chatting about the news, it kept me from freaking out. Can't speak for my husband though, this was his worst fear but he stayed calm for me. Big shout-out to the anesthetist for making small talk with us as they were cutting me open, we almost missed the doctor saying the baby was born. All three of us thought she said the baby is a boy. I looked bewildered at my husband going ""Oh no, all that pink stuff!"" It felt like eternity waiting to hear our daughter cry but the anesthetist reassured us she's fine, moving around and has a lovely color. Because there's an increased risk of infection for her, they gotta do all the checks before they bring her to us. When the neonatal nurse brought her over, I went ""Oh my god, she looks huge!"" IUGR my arse! She was 6lb 8oz at 37+5. We were able to see her for 5 minutes before they whisked her away to the neonatal unit for a course of antibiotics. 

Husband went with them as the surgery team sewed me up. We weren't able to do skin to skin like I wanted but that's okay. When husband came back with her to the transitional ward, she had a little cannula in her arm for antibiotics, it's so heartbreaking to see but again, whatever they need to make sure she's okay. He was able to stay with us for 4 hours until we were transferred to the postnatal ward. We stayed at the hospital for 2 nights and was finally discharged on Wednesday night after all the blood checks came back negative for infection, we were almost kept for another night due to low blood sugar from lack of feeding. We ended up doing formula intervention because if I have to stay another night, I will have a break down. Those two nights by ourselves in the hospital were the most difficult and isolating thing I've ever done. The midwives and staff were all absolutely lovely and does what they can for us but it isn't the same as having my husband there especially after I've just had a caesarean. I cannot thank the hospital staff enough and God bless the NHS but giving birth during covid times can suck a big one. Also she didn't need to come out early at all, kind of salty about it but we made the best decision based on the information we had at the time. She is lovely and smiley, we are happy and healthy, that's all that matters.",12,5,2021-01-28,birth weight
PregnancyUK,"Pregnancy insecurities: FTM 25y/o, 15W6D","Hi all! I’ve been a lurker here for a little while (and the /pregnant sub). I’ve just come here to vent a little and to seek moral support from fellow mothers/mother-to-be’s with the same or similar insecurities. So, up until around week 12 into 13 I was still feeling pretty nauseous and extremely exhausted, albeit those symptoms had improved in comparison to earlier weeks. I was throwing up, sleeping like a cat and had serious food aversions and could barely eat. I lost a little weight due to that which concerned me a little, but before becoming pregnant I’d lost weight somehow unintentionally and I was at a point where I liked my body, how it looked and how my clothes felt.

Now, I feel like I have totally ballooned... I am eating a lot better however, I must admit; I’ve had a couple Maccy Ds here and there... I think my body was making up for missed meals and some lost calories??? But I feel terribly swollen, like I’m possibly holding a lot of water? And I feel WIDE! It all seems to have happened fairly suddenly. My husband is great, he is always trying to reassure me and put my racing mind at ease. I have a few triggers from a previous eating disorder — my relationship with food and my body have gotten a lot better over the years but whenever I gain weight it is still bothersome for me. I’m incredibly hard on myself, but I have to keep telling myself that I am growing a human being and my body will change. 

Can anyone tell me their experiences with water weight? Or their weight climbing a little during 2nd tri? From your experiences have you found it to plateau at a certain stage, have you lost it after birth and breastfeeding? I apologise if I sound so shallow, it’s eating me up inside. I really struggle with this — and I am living away from home studying just myself and my husband so I’m not around a group of women as a regular support network, or the women in my family for those pick-me-ups that are soothing for the mind because only a female can get it and understand it (although my husband really tries). I don’t have many friends, never mind friends that understand — so here’s hoping any of you can give me some advice, a shoulder to cry on, some reassurance... or share your experiences. I’d love to hear from you!

If you got to the end of this then thank you for your time and thank you for reading. 

Love & light 🤍

PregnancyUK,"Birth story - vaginal at 40+1, FTM, induction, no epidural, precipitate labour, 2nd degree tear, SGA","I really enjoyed reading birth stories during pregnancy - particularly UK based ones, to get an idea of how things work under the care of the NHS (Barts Trust for me, in London). 

So, here’s mine - it’s quite late given that I gave birth in early May! It’s long, but I wanted to include details of things I was curious about when I was pregnant. 

# Background

For the most part, my pregnancy was low risk and pretty ordinary. I have PCOS but avoided developing gestational diabetes, and did well physically with the pregnancy until around 39 weeks, when I developed excruciating hip pain. That said, I did end up being induced for medical reasons. 

At the two routine ultrasounds at 12 and 20 weeks, a cyst was spotted on my right ovary. After the 20 week scan, they offered another scan at 28 weeks to check on it to see whether it had grown or not. I was pleased to have the opportunity to see my baby again, and not *too* phased by the cyst as no-one seemed particularly concerned about it. 

28 weeks came (finally! The 20-something weeks dragged for me) and the cyst had shrunk, which was great news. Unfortunately, when the sonographer measured her, she was quite small - on the 10th percentile. My understanding was that this wasn’t necessarily bad: it could be that I just make small babies. But, we scheduled two follow up scans to keep an eye. 

At 32 weeks, she measured 25% percentile which felt great! Then, at 36 weeks she was 50% percentile. At first this seemed like a good thing, but did make my husband and I wonder why her size was so all over the place. Ultrasound measurements are notoriously inaccurate, particularly as the pregnancy gets towards the end, but we were still worried.

I had an OB appointment a couple of days later, and we discussed the situation. The OB was similarly concerned about the trajectory of the percentiles 📈, and the strain that would put on the placenta. He recommended induction at 40 weeks, due to risk of placental insufficiency. I accepted, and we booked it there and then at 36+4. I had been keen to go into labour spontaneously so I felt quite mixed about it, but found that I was more accepting of it than I had expected. I'd done my homework and knew induction might be proposed, and knew what it might mean. Obviously I didn't want to have an induction for no reason, nor have a longer, more painful labour! But I felt like if there was even a slight risk of her not being okay due to going beyond term, I thought that whatever happened during the induction would be worth it. I asked about why her growth may have accelerated so much but he didn't have many ideas: we did a blood test to check again for gestational diabetes (I had done the glucose tolerance test at 28 weeks), but it also came back negative.

Still keen to go into spontaneous labour, I got my midwife to try and give me a sweep at 38 weeks. Unfortunately, my cervix was closed so she couldn’t do it. She told me the baby was quite low though, which felt encouraging. A week later we tried again at 39+6, but my cervix was still disappointingly closed.

At this point, I knew my chances of spontaneous labour were basically none. On the positive side, it meant my husband and I didn’t have to be stressed about timing contractions, when to go into the birth centre, calling an Uber, or making a mess/giving birth in it! We could have our last night at home as just the two of us.

# Induction

At 39+5 we had gone to the hospital for our covid tests, though we didn’t get to find out the results until we turned up for the induction. We had been super careful the whole pandemic and even more so during my pregnancy, so we were reasonably confident they’d be negative. Thankfully they were! We were also very lucky that the covid restrictions at the hospital around induction had changed two weeks before, and my husband was allowed to be there for the whole thing - as well as come and go as needed.

I arrived at the hospital at 9am for my induction, without my husband - we had a leak in our flat (great timing!), and a workman was coming over to see if the wall had dried out. We figured we probably wouldn’t be meeting our daughter for days, so it wouldn’t matter that he wasn't there immediately. 

I was admitted around 9:50am, surprisingly into a private room off to the side of the induction/postnatal wards. I think this was because I had a birth partner coming, and it was safer from a covid perspective to be separate. In any case, I was not complaining! A midwife showed me where to make tea/coffee and get water. I settled in and tested out the wifi, it sucked. My husband asked if he should come now as the workman had gone, but I said to stay home until after he ate lunch because not a lot was happening yet.

Some midwives passed by to take some blood and get things started. It wasn’t a good start - they failed to get blood from either of my inner elbows, so they then tried my hand. It was super uncomfortable - when one of them said they’d try that vein next after messing up the 2nd inner elbow, I was skeptical. In retrospect I wish I’d just asked for them to try elsewhere. My hand was bruised for a really long time afterwards.

I got hooked up by a midwife around noon to a machine to monitor the baby - baby was doing great. Alex did a cervical check and it was still closed and needing to thin, so she inserted a pessary at 12:48pm to get the induction going - it was the worst one by far, very painful and unpleasant. I ate some lunch (somewhat sad mac and cheese) and played some Switch. My husband left home to come around 2pm, and we played some of our Stardew Farm together and generally chilled out. 

I was due to get more baby monitoring around 6:30pm, though with the changing of the midwives it kept getting put off. My husband went home to eat dinner and sleep around 7pm - since we didn’t know what was going to happen, it felt sensible for him to be as well fed and rested as possible. Napping on the floor beside me probably wasn’t going to be fruitful, and the cafe serving food was closed to non-staff members because of covid. At this point, I tidied the room up a bit, as my stuff was everywhere. This wasn’t a room I could stay in to give birth - I would need to be transferred at 4cm to the delivery suite upstairs.

# Labour

I was finally hooked up to the monitor around 8pm. Around this time, things were starting to ramp up pain wise. Baby was still coping well with the contractions, which was a relief. An hour later however, I was not. I had breaks between contractions, but even with that I was starting to find it difficult to cope with - so I buzzed for the midwife and asked for some paracetamol and tried to take a nap. It didn’t manage that nap, and it didn't help with the pain. I buzzed again, and I asked for something stronger.

The midwife, Eva (who was amazing), suggested dihydrocodeine and I accepted. I took it around 11:45pm. The codeine didn’t help either, so I asked for help again and Eva brought gas and air. That didn’t help either, and she suggested we remove the pessary and do a cervical check to see where we were at. I felt like things were really ramping up, so whilst I waited for Eva to come back I called my husband and told him he should come. I needed his support, even though I felt guilty for taking away his sleep! I thought, given the frequency and intensity of the contractions, that I’d be 4cm and moved room soon.

Eva removed the pessary at 0:40 and did a cervical check, and I was 2-3cm and fully effaced. I was pretty deflated - in so much pain, but not yet even in active labour. I tried to remain calm, as I knew that getting stressed or panicked about it would be counterproductive. I messaged my husband to tell him the news, and felt a bit bad he was coming when nothing was really happening. I then accepted a pethidine (& anti-sickness) injection - I felt like I really needed a break from all the pain and intensity. I had originally not really wanted this pain relief option, but I discussed it with Eva - she said the baby was doing well on the monitor, so she wasn't worried about it causing any issues. I had hoped it would help me relax, perhaps sleep a little or at least conserve some energy, and that would allow me to be in a good place for everything to come much later on. I started a message to my husband explaining about the potential side effects and how I felt okay with them, but was in too much pain to ever finish it and hit send - the draft was still there when I next went to message him after giving birth!

What I did not expect was the injection to still not give any pain relief. Contractions were so painful, and it was a lot - I was vocalising (aka shouting) through them. My husband arrived, and I remember thinking he must have been in for a shock seeing the state I was in, given how chill things had been when he left (he said later from my phone call he knew roughly what to expect). My waters then exploded - it felt very weird, but did give me a little relief. Eva re-checked on my progress, and I had gone to 7cm in the last 30 minutes 😲! She then started to try and get me moved upstairs to deliver, but there were no rooms free - she knew I had to go soon, so made it happen somehow. 

I don’t remember a huge amount about the transfer, I was in so much pain and already pushing involuntarily. Someone took the mouthpiece off the gas and air canister I’d been using, and put it in my hands to squeeze during contractions. Someone kept telling me to stop pushing and of course, I couldn’t. Someone kept telling me ‘well done well done’ (though I didn’t know what for 😅). My husband was behind the bed, laden with all our crap - a car seat, wheely bag for me, a couple of backpacks and all our snacks (we packed enough for 4 days 🙈!).

# Delivery

At 1:52am we were upstairs and we were handed over to midwife Alice. As she was setting up for delivery, my husband showed Alice our birth preferences - though really most of it seemed irrelevant now. I remember thinking how pointless it was when he asked me if I should - I had wanted to keep mobile, try different positions and be in water for pain relief etc, but it happened so fast I got none of that! I was glad we showed her them though, she took the time to read everything and did take what she could into consideration. Alice then examined me at 2:15am and found that I was 10 cm. In retrospect, I must have been in transition whilst we moved - 0/10, would not recommend. 

In the brief calm before we started pushing, Alice explained that if anything happening was concerning and she needed to escalate the situation, she would hit the emergency buzzer behind my bed and the room would flood with people. Whilst it was scary to think that was a possibility, it was strangely reassuring to know there was a process in place in case the situation required it.

I started pushing, and at first, the baby was dealing with it well. It was hard going, I was pushing as much and as hard as I could. It was difficult to gauge whether or not it was going well. I kept going, trying to focus on pushing. I was on my back, which wasn’t something I’d wanted, but was in too much pain to really care/try and move too much. After a while, I remember hearing vaguely that the baby was starting to show signs of distress, so Alice hit the emergency buzzer and the room was filled with people just as she said. I heard someone mention an episiotomy. I knew things were really getting serious and slightly scary, so despite feeling like I was already pushing as much as I possibly could, I pushed even more. The amount of pain and pressure was intense, I just tried to focus on getting her out at all costs.

At 2:27am, our daughter was born - 2.76kg (6lbs 1oz)! I had pushed for 11 minutes 😲. The pressure build up on top of all the pain had been so intense, it felt amazing that it was all gone! I asked if she was okay because I couldn’t hear crying and wasn’t sure - thankfully she was fine, with an Apgar score of 9. I then asked if they’d given me an episiotomy, as I had no idea if it had been needed or not! They hadn’t, there hadn’t been time, but I had a second degree tear. I had skin to skin, delayed cord clamping and my husband cut the cord. 

Delivering the placenta was rough, it took seemingly forever, even with the injection. One of the doctors who had come when the emergency buzzer was pressed came back to help, she and Alice were discussing options of what to do if it didn't come - this wasn't something I knew anything about, so I was quite apprehensive. Thankfully it came just in time, so no intervention was needed.

After this, I just needed stitching up and it would be all finished! Unfortunately, this didn't go very smoothly either. Alice was recently qualified (I found out later I was the third person she ever sewed up!) so she wanted some support to do them (very reasonable, I preferred she did it with help). However, it was a very busy night, so she struggled to find help. Meanwhile, I'm lying on my back worrying about what state my tear is in, trying not to fret about what I felt like was a gaping wound. It was so stressful. I tried not to move much, for fear of harming it somehow. While I was waiting, Alice asked me if I wanted to hold my daughter again, but I didn't - it felt too overwhelming, too difficult to do so. So I told her to give her to my husband instead. I felt a bunch of guilt about this, but preferred that to awkwardly holding her whilst not really able to do so. Plus, it gave my husband the opportunity to do some skin to skin with her - which was great.

Two hours passed, and finally Alice found a friend to support her with my stitches. They changed the bed up so my legs were spread in stirrups, and was elevated so they could operate at a convenient height. It was very odd, I felt super exposed. The stitching took a lot longer than I had expected - 40 mins or so. I had thought it would be about 10. Ultimately I had zero complications with the stitches, so they did an excellent job - it was just a shame the circumstances around this, on top of a long placenta delivery, made it horrible.

# Postnatal 

The hours after this were up and down. I vomitted a lot. Dinner from the day before, breakfast from the day. It was gross and annoying, but not the end of the world. Our daughter was safely here, it hasn't been too bad, and we would all get to go home soon! Or so we thought. To go home, we needed to be transferred downstairs to the postnatal ward, and then they could discharge us. 

At 3pm (11.5 hours after giving birth!) we were finally transferred downstairs, and around 5pm, a midwife told me I have to stay for 3 days because the baby came out small and they wanted to monitor her. I felt betrayed. I sobbed, so, so hard. My husband then had to leave because ward hours are 9am-5pm. I'd just been through so much, and yet was alone on a freezing cold ward with a newborn to care for.

Later on, the night shift midwife passed by to introduce herself. She asked how I was doing, and I burst into tears again. She made me a cup of tea, sorted out the temperature, and then sat in the corner of the ward doing her paperwork throughout the whole night - I am forever grateful, I felt so much less alone. Over the night, I did the best I could, trying to get to grips with breastfeeding. I changed my first poopy nappy without getting poop on anything, and felt like a superhero! A couple of hours later I had my first post-labour poop, which was surprisingly fine!

The next day, I asked every midwife I saw as well as the doctor who did my daughter's routine tests if I could go home yet. The midwives said only the doctor could get me discharged early; the doctor said she didn’t have that kind of power. Eventually, one of the midwives checked the guidelines around babies who were born small for their gestational age (SGA) and she found that keeping someone for 3 days was if the percentile was 2nd percentile or below - my baby was 2.2 - so I got her to discharge me, and went the hell home. It was such a relief to be home, and be able to feed and care for her with the support of my husband, rather than alone.

# Reflections

I had a birth experience discussion with a midwife from my hospital last week, to help me piece together some of my experience - it all happened so quickly a lot of it was blurry. Overall, I feel very lucky for my birth experience. It had bad parts for sure, but I didn't come away traumatised (maybe that’s a low bar? 😬). 

Looking back at the postnatal experience, I can understand the midwives wanting to be really certain a smaller baby was doing okay (any baby, really). The situation would have felt 100x less awful if we’d been informed of the situation from the start, not so late in the day. Another option would have been to let us go home, and then come in each day for any extra checks etc. It was totally awful at the time, but in the end it was just an extra day in hospital - it could have been much worse.

I did absolutely loads of research about labour, birth, hypnobirthing etc whilst pregnant, and the thing I took most away from it all is how unpredictable it all is. As someone who likes to be prepared, this is a scary prospect! But I found it to be manageable - in the days before my induction, I was sitting on the sofa reading the NICE guidelines to understand the process, what options might be presented, etc. It definitely helped me feel happier and more in control of the situation. It’s also funny how what you want can and will change. Early on, I really didn’t want an induction. But when it turned out that was on the table for me, it was an easy decision and I’m glad I chose to do it.

I don't have any big regrets - though I do wish I’d asked for my placenta to be sent to pathology to satisfy my curiosity, and find out if it did have issues.

# Now

We’re about 3 months later now. The intensity of the early days was higher than I had expected - the lack of sleep was about what I figured it would be, but that on top of finding breastfeeding very hard… it was a lot. I didn’t expect to be feeding 6+ hours every day for so long (even now we’re usually at least 4.5 hours every day), nor how that would impact my mental health. I had known that breastfeeding might not work out, but I didn’t know it might not work out because it was so challenging (I thought it would be more of a binary “works” or “doesn’t work” I guess?). I had no idea it would be such an emotional rollercoaster either. I remain a little bitter than neither of the breastfeeding courses I took whilst pregnant mentioned this, lol.

I didn’t bond with her from the start - I thought that might be the case, so I gave myself some grace and time to get there. For a long time I never thought I’d have or even want to have kids, but hey here we are. Parenting is relentless so far, but it’s incredible to see her grow, change and learn ✨.",62,4,2021-08-06,gestational age

In May of 2019, I started having symptoms of a sinus infection, and they just never went away. The nasal congestion mostly stopped, but the severe chest congestion, trouble breathing, and frequent, heavy, productive cough is still going. I was referred to a pulmonologist, and did lung function testing and a sleep study. I had normal spirometry and moderately reduced diffusing capacity. My FVC was 2.38 liters, and FEV1 was 1.85. The FEV1/FVC ratio was 77.6%. My API was 6. While I have no idea what any of that means, he said I had very mild sleep apnea, and was otherwise unconcerned. He ordered a chest and sinus CT, and both were normal. I still have the severe cough, trouble breathing and chest/sinus congestion, continuously, and occasional nasal congestion/irritation. I've had it for 29 months, and have only seen temporary improvement when on short courses of steroids. My GP ran a bunch of labs in June, including a CBC with differential. Other than slightly elevated WBC, there was nothing concerning. In August, the pulmonologist ran another, and my WBC had gone up to 12.8, and my neutrophils (?) were high, but he remained seemingly unconcerned.

I also started having bilateral pitting edema. I saw a cardiologist, and he couldn't find anything wrong, but that comes and goes still, as well.

In June of 2019, I started experiencing pretty severe muscle and joint pain of two types. One, while it isn't static in severity, seems to stay within a certain range, pain-wise. Mostly in my shoulders, knees, back, and groin area. It's a dull, flu-like ache, and never goes away. It's at its worst when I wake up. The other type is this random, sudden, terribly intense stabbing pain that can occur anywhere on my body, from between my toes, to my joints and muscles, to my ear, or my genitals, and basically everywhere in between. It usually happens repeatedly, not in a regular rhythm, between 30 seconds and 10 minutes duration. It may be a bit more likely at night, but not very distinguishably so. 

I saw an orthopedic specialist, and he confirmed the arthritis, and told me there was nothing else wrong with me.

In August of 2019, sudden onset of extreme pressure in my right ear. The pressure initially lasted about a week, during which I started having tinnitus in that ear. The pressure sometimes comes back, but the ringing in my ear hasn't ceased since it began. I'm pretty sure I'm losing hearing in that ear. Sometimes I have heavy TMJ pain with the pressure, when it happens.

I saw an ENT, had an exam and a hearing test, and nothing else, other than him reviewing the CT. He said it would all probably go away on its own. When I called and told him it had not, he told me to quit smoking and go to a tinnitus clinic. 

Still not getting any help, miserable and frustrated, I went to a rheumatologist at my GP's referral. He literally didn't do a single test, and basically said it was all in my head. 

I saw a total of 6 doctors, over maybe fifteen visits. 

Every doctor told me to lose weight and quit smoking, as if that would solve everything. They offered no other solutions or more in depth diagnostic procedures.

I was in the process of losing weight when all this started. I've struggled with that since I was a small child. The orthopedist told me that losing 5% of my body weight would significantly reduce my pain. I had already lost over fifty pounds, WELL over 5%, and managed to maintain that loss for several months. It didn't help. Not even a little. He ignored any possible diagnostic implications of that, saying only that ""We should always celebrate these little victories."" My pain continued to worsen, and physical activity/exercise became more and more difficult and painful. I've since gained back about half of what I lost. 

Every doctor told me to quit smoking. I tried so hard, and managed for maybe six months before I caved to the immense stress and started back. Not once during that six months did my sinus or chest congestion, cough, or trouble breathing improve, without the aid of steroids. 

I felt completely dismissed and minimized, humiliated by the doctors' constant harping on the possibly obvious causes that don't seem to affect my symptoms, while refusing to even consider any other possibilities. It felt both useless and traumatizing to even think about trying to find another doctor.

Early this year, I started occasionally experiencing fluid leaking from my ear. It's usually clear, but sometimes has a very faint yellowish or pinkish tint. 

About four months ago, I started having diarrhea, almost every time I eat anything, usually within less than an hour of starting to eat. My gut has been kind of sensitive and temperamental for years, but this is way beyond anything I've ever experienced for this long. I'm not dehydrated. I have very little appetite. I'm down to about one meal a day, and maybe one snack 2-3 days a week. I stopped drinking coffee, I've never been a drinker, as far as alcohol is concerned, and I have tried the BRAT diet several times. Unless I take at least 2 Imodium every day, this problem continues. 

I started having some sort of heartburn/acid reflux thing, which I started taking Prilosec for, but I still have breakthrough episodes that seem completely unrelated to what or whether I eat. Even with the Prilosec, I take several Tums, probably 3-4 days a week. 

My vision suddenly worsened early this year, and I got glasses for the first time in my life, and my eyes are almost always dry, but somehow also watery. They seem to be producing more eye gunk than they ever have, too, and not just when I'm asleep. 

As far as medications are concerned, I am only taking three prescribed medications, Zoloft and valium. 100 & 5 mg, respectively, once a day, and an Albuterol rescue inhaler. The rest is vitamins and over the counter stuff for everything. I drink generic Theraflu for the congestion/cough as needed, and take a Zyrtec once a day. It's the only thing I've found that helps. I take the highest concentration of Charlotte's Web CBD oil for the seizures, once a day. Prilosec, once a day. Imodium, two tablets per day, but I usually skip a couple of days every couple of weeks. Tums as needed. OTC pain meds as needed. 

I feel like I'm dying slowly, and no one can or will help me. I'd kind of rather just get it over with, than suffering like this much longer. 

Please, if ANY doctor has any ideas on what might be wrong with me, or how to get doctors to actually listen to me, or what *kind* of doctor I should see, please help me. I'm at the end of my rope. 

Thank you.

### Edited to add: 

Huge thanks to the peanut gallery, but I DON'T actually have COPD. Sorry I didn't include in the OP, but the pulmonologist said there was no obstruction, and that this was unequivocally NOT that. If he'd said it was, I probably wouldn't be asking in here for answers. But go off. 🙄

I didn't deny that my weight is problematic. I'm fully aware. But it is NOT the source of the symptoms I'm currently having. I've always struggled with my weight, since I was maybe 6 or 7 years old, but it's never been this bad, before I started having seizures, when I weighed around 170 lbs. The medication roller coaster I was on for several years before they deemed my seizures intractable left me with about 60 extra pounds. The condition the seizures left my body in, afterwards, made it impossible to lose weight for a long time. When I was able to lose weight, I did. Fifty pounds. Then I got extremely ill, and now I can barely get out of bed, let alone cook or exercise. But I guess if it makes you feel better to harp on me about the ***results*** of my health issues, rather than helping me figure out what is *causing* them, that says something about you. I'm basically shitting my brains out, and only eating one moderately sized meal a day, but yeah. The weight that I'm not losing while having no appetite and being sick as soon as I eat anything is **totally** what we need to focus on, first. 

I did quit smoking for a while. The fact that my life had become basically endless misery and I felt like I was dying, added to the fact that quitting produced a host of other issues (including weight gain - imagine that!) and I basically had no pleasure in anything and wanted to die, kind of made it seem like maybe smoking wouldn't be so bad. At that point, I figured if I was dying and nobody would help me, may as well hurry it along. It helps me deal with... everything. Sue me. 

But yeah, sure. To hell with me unless I admit I'm a horrible lazy slob who needs to basically change the demonstrably unsurmountable ***effect*** of my illnesses, or give up one of the few pleasures I have left, right? If I debase myself and admit I'm a stupid idiot, could we maybe move on to talking about, oh, I don't know, ***my. Actual. SYMPTOMS???***

Seriously. If you're going to be a jerk, and you're not a doctor, why? You don't know as much as you think you do, and you're not helping anyone. If you **are** a doctor, please understand that I'm already doing the absolute best I am capable of, and I'm desperate. But ignoring 90% of my symptoms to focus in on the smoking and obesity is not going to help me. That's the problem that led me here in the first place. I'm not sick because I'm fat. I'm fat because I'm sick. And smoking, while it may be contributing to a couple of the things that are happening to me, is completely unrelated to most. I'd be really grateful if, instead of ignoring everything else, those who can't look past the one portion of symptoms that may be related to smoking just pretended that *those* symptoms don't exist, and focus on the ones they can make themselves care about.",3,47,2021-10-22,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Can anyone figure out what's wrong with my heart? Because my doctors can't.,"40f, 167cm, 53kg, non smoker, non drinker, UK.

Since I was 22 I've been having occasional violent palpitations - it's not uncommon for me to have tachycardia of 200bpm for a whole hour.

In my 20s my lifestyle was very different - I lived off beer and coffee and cigarettes and adrenaline basically - but in my 30s I quit alcohol and smoking, reduced caffeine intake, and now I only have one weak mug of matcha green tea a day.

I've had several 24-hour ECGs: nothing. I had an echocardiogram about 3 years ago: nothing. Thyroid levels are fine.

I'm currently a little anemic, so taking iron for that, but this is a new thing (possibly caused by heavy periods, which have only happened since covid).

The palpitations have been happening every few weeks / months for almost 20 years and nobody can tell me why.

I was diagnosed with WPW in my 20s in a different country, but after returning to the UK I was told that this was a misdiagnosis: all UK cardiologists have confirmed I don't have WPW.

No UK cardiologist has been able to explain why I get these palpitations.

Vagal maneuvers sometimes help end these palpitation events, but mostly I just take 10mg of propanolol and lie on my bed for up to an hour, maybe taking another 10mg, until they pass. I've been told 200bpm is crazy dangerous and I should call for an ambulance, but I have small kids and nobody to babysit so it's not happened yet.

I have photographic evidence of my heartrate during these events from pulse oximeters and BP devices, but no actual ECGs of the palpitations themselves, not since my 20s (and these were in a different country and I've been unable to acquire my medical records).

My BP averages 100/65, my resting heart rate is 50-60bpm (another thing I've asked my doctors about, as I'm not an athlete, but they say it's nothing to worry about as my O2 levels are 99-100% and I'm not dizzy).

Can anyone suggest what's wrong with me? I have small kids and I don't want to just randomly die from one of these tachycardia events. They're exhausting and scary.

Edited to clarify: these tachycardia events happen completely randomly. Not triggered by stress or exertion, for example. Have been unable to link them to any time of day, psychological state, food, hormones, nothing. Sometimes I can go a whole year with nothing happening. This month I've had 3 events. I've had two pregnancies with no tachycardia and one pregnancy with two tachycardia events (which was thoroughly investigated and nothing was found).",10,25,2021-11-03,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Bleeding for a month - 22F,"

Hey..I’m 22F, 110 lbs, 5 ft 2, i take the mini pill and 150 mg of lamotrigine daily (bipolar disorder). I’d really like to know what could be wrong with me? I have been bleeding for a month straight now. The bleeding started as lighter than usual, it was pinkish, then it turned bright red, then brown, then back to bright red, brown again, and now it’s brighter red again. It’s been 31 days that this has been going on. I saw a doctor through my university a couple weeks ago and they tested me for STDs, those tests were negative. Took a home pregnancy test and also got tested during that appointment, both negative. She told me to wait it out and said she thinks it’s probably not anything serious. She told me to contact her in early January if I’m still bleeding and she might have to refer me to a specialist. I decided to set up an appointment with a gynecologist on my own, but there were no appointments until the second week of January. I don’t have big clots or anything, but the bleeding just doesn’t seem to be getting lighter, sometimes it feels like it’s getting slightly heavier (compared to my regular period the flow seems light-regular, it’s not the amount of blood that’s scaring me, it’s how long it’s been going on). What could be wrong with me?

I’m not having any extreme pains. Maybe light-mild cramping every now and then, but it isn’t constant. Had a migraine the other day which I sometimes get before the start of my period. This all started around the time I was supposed to get my period, and according to my period tracking app..right now is around the time I’d be getting my period again. But there was no break in the bleeding in between. 

I take the mini pill!!! Progesterone only! I started this pill THREE years ago and have been taking it daily ever since.

Hello, I had an extreme fight with my spouse this morning. I ended up screaming top of my lungs and hyperventilating. I knew I had to remove myself from the situation so I left. The duration of me freaking out was probably 20 minutes. 

To explain why the fight happened is a long story but my spouse has become verbally abusive during my pregnancy. I know I have to address it. 

Will this cause a miscarriage or harm my baby? I can feel baby moving here and there after I removed myself from the situation. I am really scared I harmed my baby.

AskDocs,"Niece, (Female, 4) suddenly started soiling herself again, all tests came back fine.","My sister got some imagery test on her urinary tracks it all reads that everything is normal sized and well developed. She used to tell when she needed to pee or poo but then out of nowhere she started peeing in her clothes, she doesn't seem to be aware of it. Her mom had to go back to using diapers. 

Some info about my niece that might be relevant:

- She was born at 8 months (not full term pregnancy)

- She has an eye problem, her pupils don't align and she sees deformed images (according to her ophthalmologist). She has glasses that correct that.

- It nearly took her 2 years to walk and to this day her pronunciation is all over the place. Her sentences are deconstructed and not cohesive.

- She has a 1 year old sister and used to do stuff like pinch her, pull her hair, pour water on her during the first months.

- My sister (Her mom) used to wet her bed until ninth grade. Yes, she was 15 and still peed in her sleep.

- Said sister isn't very patient with my niece and yells at her when she poops herself with the occasional clap when niece is really acting up.

Is this a stress thing that could pass or could it be incontinence like very old people. Where should her parents consult. All tests say she physically fine. What could be the issue?",3,3,2021-12-19,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Intense pain while on period/sometimes pooping,"I'm a 34F and having incredibly intense cramps while on my period and occasionally while pooping. 

Background: I've been married for 9 years and we have been trying to get pregnant for about 10 months. I've never used any kind of hormonal birth control or implants (for two reasons: I believe life begins at conception, so I don't want to use anything that could potentially cause harm to a fertilized egg, and I had a blood clot). 

I have extremely regular periods, lasting 7 days, every 26-30 days. I track it using Flo, and have for several years. A few years ago, I skipped a cycle or two, pregnancy tests were negative, and my gyno did a bunch of blood work, and everything was normal. My cycles went back to normal without any changes and have been regular since. Cycle day 1 is usually fairly light to moderate, Days 2 & 3 are the heaviest, Days 4 & 5 are light, and Days 6 & 7 are basically just heavier than spotting. I pretty regularly have an achy lower back a few days before and during my whole period, although sometimes it just feels like a band of pressure around my midsection. I used to rarely get cramps. For the last year or two, I'd get a day of pretty bad cramping, but it was manageable, but it would only be a few times a year. For the last 6-8 months, nearly every cycle, around day 5 or 6, I've been getting extremely debilitating cramps. They will start suddenly and last 1/2-1 hour. They are incredibly painful--I can't stand, I feel like I'll throw up from the pain, I cry. It feels like one intense, long cramp with no relief. I try to take 1,000 mg Tylenol as soon as I realize what's happening, but the last time it happened, I couldn't get up to get any. My husband came home 20-30 minutes into it, and he got me some (it might have been Pamprin instead of Tylenol), and just sat with me and rubbed my back until it finally got better. That one lasted a full hour. The cramping is worse on the left.

The last 3-4 months, I started having loose stools a few days before my period, and they are similarly painful. I thought it was a one-off at first, because the second time it happened it wasn't painful, but the last cycles the pain has come back. I basically get that intestinal cramp feeling, like you've got to go NOW, but without the actual urge to go, then it just cramps and cramps. Eventually I poop, and it's normal, and the cramping stops briefly, but then it starts again. Eventually I'll poop more, and it gets progressively softer until it's very watery. It will take an hour or so of the intense cramping before that happens.

I was talking to a close friend, and she mentioned Endometriosis. Could that explain this? Is there something else that could be causing these symptoms?

I want to go to the doctor, but we've had some financial struggles, and I can't afford to go in just yet. We are trying to get it sorted out so that I can go.",2,4,2021-10-02,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Secondary Amenorrhea,"History: I’m 26, have had no children/pregnancies, prior to BC periods have always been 38ish days apart lasting 8 days usually, have been on birth control(Nuvaring) for 3 years and in February I stopped using my BC because I had no cycle. I took a ton of pregnancy tests(had “classic” pregnancy symptoms), all negative. I decided to wait til my period came back to start my nuvaring so it would be more of a natural transition, well my period never returned. I went to the MD for an unrelated problem(bloating and stomach pain) in April and she had an abdominal and pelvic ultrasound done, results were normal, no gallbladder issues or pregnancy, but she said there was a follicle present. So, I’m thinking awesome that means I should have a period soon and everything will return to normal. I finally had a “cycle” in June, but it only lasted a few days and was very light, not my normal period before or during BC. Now it’s November and I still haven’t had a cycle, nothing. My husband and I are wanting to have a child at some point and this is starting make me worry that I’m going into early menopause and that the periods I was having on BC were just withdrawal bleeding. Everything I’ve seen online says weight gain, stress, lifestyle changes can cause this, but none of this pertains to me my thyroid levels have remained stable for years and I have been on the same dose of Synthroid since I was 19.

AskDocs,Possible Endometriosis? How do I know?,"Hi all. I made a separate account for this which I hope is allowed.

I'm pretty sure I might have endometriosis but im not sure and i don't know when to finally go into the doctor and ask. I dont have a lot of money and i wanted ti wait until my yearly appointment (next one is February 22) as its covered by insurance if i wait for then, but my gf keeps telling me to go in asap.

Im f19 BTW. gf is f18 if it matters. on mobile sorry for formatting. kind of in a rush so sorry for typos as well.

around when i was 14 i started having really intense period pain to the point where it was hard ti stand or move. the pain would begin about a week before the period started and would end a week or so after my period ended. I also always had very short (maybe 4 days or so) prior to around this time but when it started my periods would last upwards of a couple weeks and be very painful, but i would only really ""spot"" during the periods as well. 

Then when i was around 16 i just straight up missee my period for about 3 months straight, even thiugh i would still have ""period pain"". i brushed it off due to stress because i remember it started around exams week but even after exams i remember i didnt have it again for a few months. 

when i was 17 i started feeling ""period"" cramps in my inner thigh/croth area (think the thigh area directly below the vagina) as well as in my hip area (both hips). i would only feel these cramps during my periods (which were still just spotting and less of periods). 

when i turned 18 i told my mom about my painful periods and how i was spotting and she recommended that i go in birth control, and i did, and my periods returned back ti normal flow (no longer spotting) but i still feel the really intense cramps before and after (and during) each period despite reading that birth control lessens period cramps (im on the combination pill BTW) 

around the same time (maybe a month or two after) i started BC, i started having incredibly intense and nonstop lower back pain(kind of on the tail bone;pain feels like a deep pressure, like something is pushing down on my tail bone), for which i was prescribed a heavy dosage of naproxen (and instructed to take every day, or at least when my back pain felt hefty). The pills did not help my back pain. and i never bothered to get a refill when i finished the bottle. 

Within the last few months as well, ive stopped taking my birth control as much too since it hasnt helped with my periods at all except for making them heavier. Not worried about pregnancy as I am a lesbian. Sexually active with my girlfriend if it helps at all, but i doubt it. we have both been STD tested and it had come back negative. Neither of us were sexually active before dating. 

Any thoughts? I only suspect Endometriosis as it sounds the most like what I experience, though I know that online research isnt enough to diagnose something like endo. hoping a doctor might know what's up. 

quick list of issues for those who dont want to read all that:

-intense cramping before and after periods

-periods are never more than just spotting, and sometimes i will go months without a period anyway. 

-intense lower back pain that hasnt gone away in a little over a year now. feels like something is constantly pushing down on my tail bone 

-inner thigh and hip pain during period (like a cramp in my those area) (was prescribed naproxen for these but it did not work so i stopped taking them)

-started taking the combination pill to help with period pain, only made the periods heavier and did not actually help with pain (stopped taking it a few months ago, was on it for about a year)

-i am a lesbian so i am not worried about pregnancy

-my gf and i have both been STD tested, both tests came back negative

-i am F19, was never sexually active before my gf

-this all started when i was around 14 and has only gotten worse since then

-never brought it up with a doctor as i never thought it really mattered, but my gf is encouraging me to go now

-i smoke if it matters also, and have been smoking for a little under a year now. but its been happening since before i even thought of touching a cigarette so i dont know if that matters. also afraid to go to a doctor for this reason (as i am technically underage now, as the legal smoking age has been raised to 21 in my country)",1,2,2021-12-10,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,What Do I Do? Possible Endometriosis,"Hello everyone. I’m having a bit of trouble on what to do here and I feel like I’m at my wits ends with this. I feel so helpless and tired and worn. I guess I’m asking for a second maybe even third opinion. I apologize for this being long. I have tried Facebook groups, a couple endo Reddit groups, I just don’t know anymore. I just am concerned and want pointers..

For some context I’m F21, live in the US, am 5’8” 1/2, Caucasian, 165 lbs, I’ve had this issue with suspected endometriosis I suppose since I was 12 but it’s only amped up more within the past 3ish years since I was 19. Current medications I take: Loryna 3 MG-0.02 MG, Zolpidem Tartrate 5 MG, Buspirone HCL 15 MG, Topiramate 25 MG, Naproxen 500 MG, and Albuterol HFA (Proventil) INH HFA inhaler. I do not drink or smoke, no recreational drug use. Medical conditions I have been diagnosed with: GERD, Psoriasis, Asthma, PTSD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Bipolar Disorder (II). 

Now for the issue: I’ve had some issues regarding endometriosis I suspect although haven’t been formally diagnosed if you will. I’ve always had very heavy, painful, abnormal periods as a start and only started them when I was 12. Sometimes my periods lasted 5 + days or more, would skip very often, super heavy, excruciating pain entire time more than what felt like “just cramps”. But everyone told me that was normal. So I didn’t think to press the issue and no one explained OBGYN stuff to me so I didn’t think I could bring this up as a concern since everyone would tell me it’s normal. Nothing felt like relief to me from heating pads or a Tylenol. The pain and periods kept getting worse and worse as well as the other symptoms I’ve faced.

Now fast forwarding I started on birth control when I was on my own at 19 before turning 20 in 2020- so last November to try and get an ease for my periods I at least thought. I started depovera (don’t know specific dosage or anything) for 5 months then I would bleed for 3 weeks straight. Then I switched to the Mili pill at planned parenthood (0.25-0.035 MG) but they didn’t tell me the pill they gave me was the highest dose (according to my 2nd gyno). Still had the pain, weird periods, heavy bleeding, etc then bleeding for 3 weeks again. 

Eventually planned parenthood told me the pill should not be giving me this issue and they don’t know what to do (this was this August), cause of my issue despite my bleeding they told me on the phone they’d do a pelvic exam on me before I came to my appointment, pregnancy test, the whole ordeal even though I had a feeling I was not pregnant. Even though sex is painful for me I use protection outside of birth control. They did a pregnancy test and I’m not pregnant, then refused to do a pelvic exam on me  cause of the bleeding so they said they don’t know what to do and to go to the hospital. So I sat in the hospital for 8 hours. They did a urinalysis on me, gave me pain meds and something for nausea, internal and external ultrasound and found no cysts, no polyps, nothing abnormal, no growths no nothing- urinalysis was fine, so they sent me home. Eventually I found a Gyno weeks later and tried explaining my issue and history, pain, you name it, even though me and my partner were each others firsts and are still together she thought I had an STD/STI and wanted to test me.. I understand ruling things out but she tested me, called me days later and I’m clean. She did a pelvic exam there and found nothing abnormal and said she doesn’t know what the issue is and that my pain is “weird”. She said from the ultrasound from the hospital however my endometrium is “abnormally thick” but didn’t say anything else about it. 

So I went to a completely different doctor in a different city down the line who I feel as if understands my concerns. So he tested me as well and I’m clean, feels nothing weird with the pelvic exam, also said my endometrium is abnormally thick and with my other wide array of symptoms and way I’ve explained my pain in general and pain during sex to him he suspects I have endometriosis but didn’t say it was a sure fire diagnosis since it is tricky to diagnose; He said he wanted to get me off the Mili pill and switch me to a low dose of Loryna. He said he will keep me on it for a couple months and if I don’t see improvement or evening out with the bleeding skip the “bleed week” and just do the normal BC pills. Still have excruciating pain, pain during sex, more often than not I am bloated, feel like vomiting, have bowel issues, I feel pain in other extremities other than the pelvic or “groin/ovarian/uterine” region for lack of a better term, I am constantly fatigued, just pain pain pain and awful periods; I have stressed this to him as well numerous times and he still wants me on these pills and doesn’t wanna see me back till March. He said if by then I see no improvement he will put me on a pill FDA recently improved for endo and that’s a way to diagnose me without the laparoscopic surgery. He said I’m young but that’s on the back burner for now. Whenever I want to try for children, however, if I don’t get pregnant within 6-12 months like couples usually do he will do the surgery then also because that raises fertility apparently. I’m not trying currently but if I’m able would like to have children in the future.

But he said as well if the endo pill doesn’t give me any improvement whatsoever that surgery would be on the back burner still too. I don’t want to hop on surgery right away or get a hysterectomy or the like if I’m able to have children since I don’t know what’s exactly going on, or if I have other options to consider first, but I’m just..tired and don’t know what to do. I feel like this is endo but I’m so tired of the pain and frustrated. I’ve called him numerous times asking what to do or where to go because I feel as if these pills from late august to now haven’t done much. I’m in so much pain and have all these symptoms I feel like I’m going crazy. I just want relief. He told me he still wants me to stick to the plan and although he is a great doctor I guess maybe a part of me doesn’t feel taken seriously too too much.. I’ve cried on the phone to him a couple times cause of the pain and more and he said if I feel it’s a genuine concern and to rule out “other possible things” out to go to the hospital, but deep down in my heart I know or I guess I’m afraid it’ll be like it was the first time I went and I don’t want to waste resources or time especially since the endo is hard to find on certain tests and scans from my understanding. He’s given me naproxen but it doesn’t help for my pain, nor does Tylenol or moltrin or ibuprofen or you name it. Least I do is lie down or am bedridden with a heating pad. I feel maybe I should get another opinion but the hassle of switching paperwork and getting more examinations and everything that comes with that I’m afraid of being disappointed or being told “that’s weird” and having no answer. I know things take time and I’m not trying to sound childish or whiny but I just want answers and some relief.. what do I do? Where do I go? What do I say or try? Could someone give me some advice or point me in the right direction? I’d greatly appreciate anything. Thank you and I’m sorry for this being long.",1,2,2021-11-27,stress during pregnancy

I apologize for formatting and length. I’m on mobile. 

For as long as I can remember I’ve been dealing with horrible fatigue. I stress going to sleep every night dreading having to deal with the next day. 

I have two children. A two year old and a four month old. My hemoglobin was low during both those pregnancies. They had me take supplemental iron and then had me discontinue after delivery in favor of a multivitamin with iron. My iron levels never improved with my first after starting the iron and they actually worsened with my second and my hemoglobin was around 8 a couple weeks before I delivered despite me avoiding caffeine/dairy and taking it with vitamin c. 

I went to my PCP yesterday for my yearly physical and to discuss my more frequent headaches. She did a few blood tests (CBC, ESR, CRP, CMP, Iron) and I was wondering if I could get some help with these results as I don’t expect to hear from her within the next couple of days.

AskDocs,Antidepressants and injuries in an athlete,"Best antidepressant for an athlete

I’m a 44 y/o female who was diagnosed with MDD when I was 19.  I went to intensive therapy and was “graduated” after a year, but it ate up my college fund (US).  I had a relapse a couple of years later and was put on Paxil, because it has worked for family members in the past.  With the exception of my pregnancy and then breastfeeding at 32 years old, when I was switched to safer medications (I tried several, with varying degrees of success- the only one that absolutely did not work was Lexapro, I believe, which made me incredibly irritable).  Nothing seemed to work quite as well as Paxil, so I eventually started using it again.  

I started running at 34 years old, and became very good- I was an athlete when I was younger- but every time I tried to ramp up training past 30 miles a week, which really isn’t a lot, I got stress fractures.  Something like 5 in a few year period.  I missed several races, including Boston.  I had a bone scan at the age of 40 and was found to have osteopenia, even though I have always been at a healthy weight and eat well.  At this time I also started developing terrible constipation and bloating, and none of my doctors could figure out why.  This went on for a year and a half and I was miserable, I tried everything, with no luck.  

I went on vacation when I was 41 and accidentally didn’t have enough Paxil to last me, due to poor planning, and I tried to taper my remaining doses and then, as we so often stupidly do, decided to try to go off of it altogether and see what happens.  The withdrawals were to be expected and lasted a few weeks, but to my amazement, I had daily bowel movements again.  I didn’t learn until recently from a pharmacist that Paxil has anticholinergic properties as well as can cause increased bone loss, something that was never addressed by any of my doctors.  I eventually had a breakdown and started on another medication, Celexa, which worked well enough until my insurance decided to no longer cover it, at which point I was forced to go on Venlafaxine (generic for Effexor) 75mg, which has worked fairly well, and I have been using it for about 2 years.

For a while I was running amazingly well, with no stress fractures (until recently), able to sustain 40 miles a week for months in a row, with down weeks, obviously, EXCEPT I have had a pattern of new injuries, specifically to my tendons, which had never happened before.  I had posterior tibial tendinitis which sidelined me, then chronic hamstring tendinopathy, which has not gone away for the past 6 months even with 4 months rest while dealing with a grade 2 tendon strain accompanied by a stress fracture to my opposite lower leg (verified by MRI). I realize I’m getting older and that some in the medical profession think running is harmful to your body, but it is essential for my mental health and otherwise keeps me very healthy.  I do not want to swim or bike.  I did buy a bike to satisfy my need to sweat and maintain cardio during this last rehab period, but it’s not the same.    

I have found reference to the fact that others have had rare tendon-related issues due to Venlafaxine.  I made an appointment with my GP, put off for too long since it’s $275 per visit, and he didn’t believe that my issues with fractures or tendons were caused by my medication.  I recovered from the aforementioned tendon strain and stress fracture, ran for a few months (ramped up slowly, lower mileage, fewer days a week and cross-trained), and now I have yet another stress fracture in the same leg, different location.  This has not been verified by MRI as I cannot spend another $900, but at this point I know exactly what they feel like since I’ve had probably 8 or 9 in the past 10 years.  I’m crying, at my wit’s end. I was wondering if any of you think that these medications could be causing my issues this time around and if you have any suggestions for a different drug to try, provided my insurance covers it, of course.  TCA?  Counseling would be nice but as you may have gathered, with my high deductible insurance plan it would be well over $100 a visit.  Physical therapy is over $100 a visit so I try to do strength and pre-hab at home using what I’ve learned from PT over the years.

My only other medical issue is asthma, I take QVAR daily and albuterol rarely.  I supplement with Cal-Mag-D, zinc, DIM (estrogen metabolizer, off and on for a few years), and sometimes iron and a B-complex.  I’ve had a copper IUD for 12 years (replaced once) and my menstrual cycles are always regular. I’m 5’9” and 142 lbs.  I’ve never had an eating disorder.   I drink a few alcoholic beverages a week but don’t go overboard, and use a small amount of marijuana at night only to help me sleep (I’m in a legalized state).

This is seriously impacting my mental health as well as my physical body.  I should also mention that I’ve never really been fully “recovered” from the depression, although I’ve managed glimpses of happiness while on the venlafaxine, so it’s better than most, I guess.

I posted this quite a while back in psychiatry, since I thought they might be more familiar with the meds, but go no response.

AskDocs,Worried about advice given my DIL,"I am an NP, but honestly don’t usually question anything said by MDs. No question that I just don’t have the education and training you all do, so I depend a lot on feedback and advice from doctors. I find myself concerned about advice given my DIL (we are very close) by her GYN. She is a 32 year old 62 inch, 120 pound para 2 gravida 3 having had a missed spontaneous AB at 20 weeks. Reason unknown. Previous to that pregnancy, she developed a clot in her cecum and was hospitalized on a heparin drip for a week. It resolved without other intervention but her GI felt that her oral contraceptives were the reason and told her to never again use hormonal birth control of any kind. I know him, have worked with him, and I respect and admire his practice. Now her GYN has refused her request for a tubal because she says her periods will be horrendous after. She has told my DIL that she thinks her clot was caused by stress (?!) and that she should use hormonal BC. First of all, I tend to not believe in stress as the sole cause of major health issues. But second, if she was stressed by the one child she had at the time of the clot, how much more stressed is she with two?  Plus my son is being deployed for 6 months. I guess she could go off BC during that time but her stress level will really be high then. Now, my son has been trying to arrange a vasectomy for over 4 months, but in my region it is very difficult to find a provider of any kind that accepts Tricare. We finally have the procedure scheduled for him but it’s a month off, and then there’s the waiting period after and times a’wastin’ for them. I am sure they want to enjoy the time before he ships out as much as possible and since they both hate condoms, she heard advice she was happy to hear and is going to use OC. Please tell me my fears are unfounded and that I have nothing to worry about as far as my darling DIL’s health is concerned.",1,4,2021-07-28,stress during pregnancy

My question is:  I had a lot of bloodwork 3 months ago when I had my c-section.  All blood counts were well within the middle of the range.  Could this change be due to not drinking enough water (even though my bloodwork shows no deficiencies or issues with kidney function).

AskDocs,What are the chances it’s still heart related? Or something else very serious? Please take the time to read,"I am a 22 year old pregnant female. 27 weeks pregnant. I’ve been dealing with chest pains at night when I lay down for bed, the pain is pretty bad id rate it a 7 out of 10. Sometimes it comes all the way from my back around to my chest, sometimes it’s just my chest or just one side of my chest. It goes away in about an hour. Worse when laying down so I usually have to sit up. It’s not every night maybe like once or twice a week but lately it’s been happening during the day too when I’m up and moving and it honestly scares me. I did end up going to the ER one night about two weeks or so ago and they did blood work, an EKG, and a chest X-ray and found nothing abnormal so the doctor just told me it was probably pregnancy/ uterus and baby growing related. My OB said it’s possibly GERD and I have also heard it could be gas. I have been getting acid reflux/heartburn way more often lately too. I had pains similar to this before this pregnancy but it happened maybe two or three times and it was never this bad. 


Some more random backstory info to add;? 
About a year ago after having my first daughter I was getting pains in the heart area and I’m a hypochondriac so I insisted my doctor do a bunch of tests and he did echocardiogram stress test X-ray and they were all normal. 

So how likely is it to still be heart related after the recent tests and the other tests I had done in the past? What does it sound like it could be? I’ve heard gallbladder could cause it but I obviously don’t know. I have an appointment this Thursday with a new doctor and plan to bring it up then but curious to see what you guys think.

PCP ordered an MRI and apparently the radiologist found white lesions. Now she can’t stop talking to me about Multiple Sclerosis. How concerned should I be?,"Age: 32
Sex: Female
Height: 5’ 5”
Weight: 180 lbs

Primary Complaint: On July 4th, I woke up with what felt like the world’s worst UTI after attending a concert in the rain the night before. I pushed water and AZO hoping I could clear it on my own. Three days later I was still experiencing pain, so my BIL wrote me a prescription for a 10-day Antibiotic. I took it all and it still didn’t clear it, so I went to an urgent care. They said it was BV, not a UTI, so they gave me an anti-fungal and yeast medication. I mention this because I haven’t felt fully well since that point. My migraines started back in the beginning of August. We were in the middle of a cross country military move and I figured that infection, coupled with the stress set them off. I hadn’t taken migraine medication for years. I had a migraine every day for a month and by the afternoon, I was nauseas and dizzy. I thought my righty eye wasn’t tracking very well either, but that’s not abnormal when my migraines are out of control. I finally went to our new doctor. I told my new doctor about my history with migraines and explained that I last had one in 2020 during my last pregnancy. She ordered an MRI since I hadn’t had one in years. When she called me with the results she said they found evidence of sinusitis which was consistent with my seasonal allergies or a cold. They also found white lesions. She said they could be consistent with someone who has a history of migraines, but they could also be consistent with someone who has a neurological disease like MS. No one has ever mentioned this to me before. She ordered a repeat MRI for December and referred me to a neurologist. I thought it was out of an abundance of caution. She has had her nurse call me three times to see why I haven’t scheduled my neuro appt. She herself called me today to explain how dangerous MS is and how I need to be treated ASAP if I have it. When I asked her if she was saying I had it, she said, “of course not, I’m just concerned about the lesions, but they could just be because of the migraines.” 

I googled MS and everything under the sun is a symptom. Now I’m freaking out. How concerned should I be?

Now I’m thinking that the tiny bit of bladder leakage my previous doc said was because of vaginal delivery AND the fact that my migraines were worse in the heat and afternoon are consistent with her pushing the Ms diagnosis. I’m freaking out.

In September 2015 I had a baby. The pregnancy was rough with severe hyperemesis. about 2 months later I knew I had a tumor, I could literally feel it growing inside me but ob/gyn refused to ultrasound based on symptoms. After another month passed I got pregnant on DEPO, suffered horrible bleeding whether from DEPO, the pregnancy or the tumor, I don't know. The tumor was removed in Jan 2016 at 12cm. Lost the pregnancy 2 weeks later at 12 weeks. Symptoms of stomach pain and nausea persisted. Had massive Tylenol overdose not long after and spent 4 days in ICU on some kind of medication that was supposed to neutralize it. Had bouts of migraine like symptoms with visual  disturbances and sever stomach pain to the point where I couldn't stand. Curled up on the floor crying in pain, unable to walk or see clearly. ER doc said cyclical vomiting syndrome. Then came the stab wound, during follow up after surgery was told my colon had looked wrong, like inflamed and just not right to the surgeon(was also noted by surgeon during the ovarian surgery.) I had bouts like this triggered by stress, red meat and headaches for years. I had a baby April this year, during my pregnancy I craved red meat, and even though I was afraid to eat it, I tried it and realized it didn't make me sick. Stress didn't make me sick anymore either. Still had migraines but not as severe. During the years of having this problem I got a bunch of different answers, none solid. From gastritis to cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Im not sure if I should expect the problem to return or just be happy that it's not bothering me now. I just feel disturbed that I suffered so much for so long and never got a single solid answer.

I would love some insight on helping me get correctly diagnosed and building a good plan of care with my new PCP (haven't had a PCP in years so now I'm finally trying to find one) on Thursday.

&#x200B;

**Background History**\- clinically diagnosed mild scoliosis, clinically diagnosed SI joint dysfunction due to hip impingement, clinically diagnosed cuboid syndrome. 

No use of drugs or alcohol other than an occasional social drink. Been on nicotine patches lowest dose for several months now. Don't drink because it gives me bad headaches the next day.

**Height/Weight-** 5'6"", 135 lbs

**Usual vitals** \- BP tends to be in the 100-110s/70s or 80s. HR often will go up to 100 at rest. Easily jumps up to 120s with walking (I do walk fast).

**Last menstrual Cycle** \- April, its always been irregularly regular and light. Over the past year it's become more regular but not always on the same date. But usually comes 1x per month. Decreased libido not sure why.

Contact wearer, saw Eye doctor in April of this year. Did not change any of my contact prescriptions. Stated the pressure in my eyes was a little high but imaging showed my eyes were healthy. Eye doctor told me to take my contacts out more regularly because I sleep in them for months even though the brand I use I can sleep in for 1 month.

Drink tons of water, and large coffee every morning, usually eat breakfast around 9am consisting of fruit. Eat mix of meat, carbs, fruits, veggies.

When I was about 23 I  saw a cardiologist and had an EKG and assessment due to chest pains that were chalked up to intercostal inflammation due to nursing school stress.

**Symptoms that I have always noticed but I never seen a physician for**\- Fatigue, every day I feel exhausted this has been going on for the past 3-5 years. Cold intolerance. Toes and Hands usually cold to the touch. Severe headaches that started in childhood to the point I had to fall asleep for them to go away. Increase in headaches over the past 3 years. I get mild headaches several times a week take ibuprofen 800 OTC PRN. Headaches tend to make me feel dizzy and decrease my depth perception when severe and give me nausea. It is not abnormal for me to wake up with a headache if any light comes in through the bedroom. Severe headaches happen once a week to every 2-3 weeks to the point I just want to lay down and put pressure on my forehead. Pain is directly above my eyebrows in the center of face and temples. I use a blue light filter on my computer and blue light glasses because starring at the screen gives me headaches. Bruise easily, very slow healer. Postural dizziness sometimes usually when I haven't eaten. I have had a very decreased libido for the past 6-7 years.

* 5/5 - flew on 2 planes - felt fine
* 5/8 - drove a boat, had sea legs after that went away
* 5/9 - woke up with a hangover from drinking too many drinks, had a headache and nausea and decreased depth perception (woozy feeling after drinking too much), rode on 2 planes to return home. On 1st planes landing I got motion sickness (I never get motion sickness). Took dramamine and it made me sleepy so I slept on the second flight home. Felt refreshed after 2nd plane ride and rest. I was exhausted when I got home, went to bed early.
* 5/10 - Stayed home from work due to being so tired still. Woke up feeling groggy.
* 5/11 - Went to work, at 2pm I started feeling ""dizzy"" and foggy, depth perception was off, felt clumsy due to decreased depth perception, and then got a headache. Went home and couldn't eat much, stayed on couch all day, got nauseated.
* 5/12 - Woke up with a mild headache, felt groggy and mentally foggy all day, decreased depth perception. I started feeling like I was rocking/swaying at work at 11am. Left work early at 1pm. Rocking feeling felt like I was on a docked boat. Did not subside all night. Nauseous in the evening.
* 5/13 - Felt fine while lying down in bed upon first awakening. Upon getting up and doing morning ADLs started feeling rocking, mental fogginess, Pressure in my head while driving. Went and got a rapid and PCR Covid test both resulted negative. Took an at home pregnancy test which was negative.
* 5/14 - Rocking after getting out of bed all day, pressure in head while driving causing some anxiety, nausea, and headache that started later in the day after rocking. Mental fogginess all day that feels like a heaviness over my eyes. Delayed though process. This was the start of the worst day. Felt like I was rocking back and forth and visually saw rocking.
   * Finally took my Blood Pressures throughout the evening, all were in the 90/60s after rest, sitting, standing, lying
   * Took meclizine 1 tab before bedtime
* 5/15 - did not wake up until 1130am which is abnormal but I figured the meclizine made me drowsy since I am sensitive to drugs that make me drowsy. No rocking upon first waking up while lying in bed. Slowly got up. BP 90s/60s. Felt groggy, drowsy, and floating like I was walking on a trampoline. Floating feeling. Took a shower and everything got much worse. Had to get back in bed. Loud noises from a phone call with my sister gave me a headache and make me feel like I was rocking more.  Mental fogginess all day and periodic nausea. Took an hour to change my bed sheets by self. Noticed patterns made rocking worse and looking in mirror. Took meclizine before bedtime again 1 tab. Rocking all day. Stayed in bed all day. Decreased appetite.

ENT appointment at 10AM, very ""dizzy"" felt lots of swaying while getting from the car through the lobby back to the room where I was being seen by the ENT.
   * ENT took blood pressure - 80/58 sitting, right arm after walking from lobby back to office.
   * ENT states ears are clear and everything in regards to my ear function is normal. Audiologist reports my hearing is above normal.
   * ENT reports I have a papilloma on my uvula that is likely benign and recommends I have it removed at another office visit since it could increase in size
   * ENT reports my symptoms are consistent with Mal de debarquement syndrome but wants me to get lab work done with PCP on Thursday to rule out anything else that could be causing it especially since my blood pressure was so low and has been low recently (just a note when I was in my early 20s because my stepmom said my skin looked like it was green and was concerned I had my thyroid and iron checked at a patient first and they stated the lab results were all normal). Provided me a lab slip to take to my PCP and further discuss my symptoms. She stated she could prescribe valium but I declined because it wont fix the problem just help me cope and I can't take medications that make me drowsy during the day.
   * Rechecked BP at 1130 with own monitor - 117/70 HR 78 RA sitting
   * Ate lunch at 1215
   * Rechcked BP at 1252 98/68 HR 77 LA sitting
   * Swaying continued, pressure in head/mild headache around 1240pm

Things that increase the swaying/rocking feeling

* Overhead lighting
* Patterns
* Adls
* Walking
* Small spaces
* Showering
* Loud noises
* Working at a computer
* Contrasting heights
* Things close to my face
* High speed driving for the first 10 minutes or so

&#x200B;

Things that decrease the swaying/rocking feeling

* Sleep
* lying down and watching tv and zoning out
* Movement

**So before I see my PCP and explain all of this to him/her is there any testing or lab work I should advocate to have while I am in the office. And should I see a neurologist and cardiologist if my PCP can’t pinpoint this? I’m also wondering if there has been any success with use of SSRIs to treat debarquement syndrome because I have been depressed but am seeing a counselor. My history of ongoing fatigue for the past several years and low blood pressure makes me think there could be more than just mal de debarquement syndrome going on or maybe in addition to it.**

AskDocs,Any OB-Gyns? hCG pregnancy test keeps fluctuating and I'm afraid of an ectopic!!,"I (20F) recently ended up in ER due to severe abdominal pain (mainly in stomach) and eventually started vomiting all the medications they gave me (ondansetron, panadiene forte - not sure why the nurse would make me try that the first time, gaviscon and some chewy antacid - I think mylanta). 

I have had recurring episodes of what I thought was gastritis or indigestion (vomiting up meals from 3-4 hours ago, and eventually vomiting bile). It has made significant impacts on my ability to work and study and has happened on and off for the past 18 months. Nurses here are confused as to why this wasn't investigated earlier. These episodes happen perhaps every month or so, and seem to be worse during stressful periods in my life.

I previously visited ER with abdominal pain in August, and it was 5 hours after my first Pfizer vaccine dose. I had fainted with cold chills and severe sharp sudden pain, but by the time I was seen in ER I was just anorexic and struggling to keep food down. Lost a lot of fluids vomiting. Lower right abdominal was tender to touch. They checked my hCG and that was low, so I was not pregnant two months ago. But my CRP was high - did another blood test a week after and CRP was back to normal. They told me it may be an ovarian cyst that ruptured. Had an ultrasound 5 days after and there was no cysts. GP suggested I may have endometriosis, but I have always had regular periods and not bled heavily (recently developed more pain during periods/sex though).

Yesterday evening, 17th October, I was able to walk into ER and pain wasn't too severe. I just wanted answers as to why this has been recurring (as per advice of an online nurse). My symptoms were: severe nausea whenever I am hungry, I dont feel normal pangs of hunger anymore, just nausea (since starting the pill). Also super picky about food and the smell of food, which made me anxious about being pregnant. It usually goes away after eating, which is why I feel like it may be gastritis. But this time, eating did not help. I went to ER and shortly started feeling worse after being given panadiene forte, which I heard is not uncommon. I vomited twice, about 800mL total, and I was moved to another quieter room for the night. I vomited another three times, and struggled to keep water and medications down. I was COVID swabbed (which stung so bad after vomiting) and a urine sample was sent off to test for pregnancy/STI. I was super anxious about being pregnant recently, just never got around to testing myself. I started micronelle ed (combination contraceptive) the first day of my period which was about 3-4 weeks ago, and my period was prolonged after starting the pill. I read about it and I thought I could have unprotected sex immediately after starting on my 1st period day, and so I started sex 5 days after starting the pill.

My urine results came out positive for pregnancy. I was shocked. I told my partner and he was too. I have been taking my pills daily, but I DID change from morning to night at one point to reduce morning nausea. I took my previous pill 7am, then my next pill 6pm or later the next day, as advised by a pharmacist. But she told me when starting a pill I should wait *7 days*, and I stupidly didn't listen because I had read that if you start on your period you should be safe (not ovulating). I don't know if/when I fell pregnant, either right before the pill or during the first week of it I may have ovulated. 

A Dr came in and palpated my abdomen, by now, the nausea had subsided a bit and pain was now In my lower left abdominal region. They took a blood test for pregnancy and it has come out negative. The number specifically is going to be sent to my GP - will update. Then they requested another urine test and it came out positive.. What's going on? Could something else be happening that is skewing the results? I am most afraid of an ectopic pregnancy - what can I do to prevent that from happening?

Medications: Micronelle ed, stopped low dose isotretinoin 20mg/day (not every day) about two weeks into the contraceptive pill. 

History: Anxiety, and potentially ADHD (not confirmed). Had an ultrasound twice for PCOS and diagnosis is still not definite. They couldnt find cysts or anything. No nutritional def/anaemia from my most recent blood test about a 1.5 months ago. 

I am still waiting on what the doctor has to say about my blood hCG.",1,1,2021-10-18,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,"Neutrapenic 2yo but ""Nothing to worry about.""","Hello! 

&#x200B;

This is about my son, I just need some advice. 

&#x200B;

 First off, I want to say I have experience working as an MA in peds neuro and ID, so my knowledge of medical information is not just from googling but also from working in the field for years. 

&#x200B;

I have SLE, Fibromyalgia, Asthma, narcolepsy type 1, and all the comorbidities that come with it. I was on medication for most of these ailments during my pregnancy. 

I was followed by a perinatologist, who had me on baby asprin during the pregnancy.  I was induced due to low fetal heart tones during my weekly stress test.  There were no complications aside from IUGR, and my son was term at 38 weeks, vaginal birth, weighed 5.4oz.  I have had 2 pregnancies with no miscarriage, first pregnancy had high complications during delivery.

&#x200B;

My son's current diagnoses: Autism level 1, gross motor & speech delay, severe neutropenia. 

He is currently 27 months, 22lbs, 2'8"", and Filipino/Caucasian. 

&#x200B;

Hopefully, this isn't too long, but I have a feeling it all ties together.

&#x200B;

When my son was born I noticed some small twitches, I ignored it since he passed all of his tests and I knew newborns have to just ""get it out of their systems."" 

Starting the first night in the hospital, he slept through the night.

&#x200B;

When we went home I still noticed the twitching. It was rare though. 

&#x200B;

Around 2 weeks, the twitches increased. Always while sleeping, usually just his arms though sometimes his feet would shoot up in the same way as infantile spasms. I showed a recording to the neurologist I worked with, who ordered a vEEG. I was told he was having benign neonate movements, which he would grow out of. 

&#x200B;

I still see them occasionally, though it's more like a quick shiver. My 7yo daughter and I have this too.

&#x200B;

When I was at work (right before covid,) my Mom called to say he felt HOT, he was screaming, and had large swelling behind his ear.

 When I arrived, he was no longer crying, but lethargic. His temp was 101.9f, but I didn't see any swelling. Five minutes later, the swelling was back, but behind the opposite ear....then both...then gone. 

&#x200B;

 In the car to the pediatrician's office, I could hear stridor breaths the whole way there. Once we got to the office, he was fine. The MA took his vitals, not even a fever. When the pediatrician came in, his fever was back and he had a rash on his chest and was dx with roseola. 

&#x200B;

He has had a double eye infection requiring axb twice. 

&#x200B;

With covid hitting, he had (has) spent most of his life at home, not being around other children or illnesses. As I'm on immunosuppressants and high-dose steroids, we took quarantine seriously, not even visits from family. 

&#x200B;

We moved from our apartment that was found to have Chaetomium, Aspergillus, and Cladosporium, into a house out in the suburbs. TONS of plants (think self-sustaining food forest,) with a backyard full of soil. 

&#x200B;

Suddenly my perfect sleeper was constantly waking screaming. I figured it was the new environment. 

&#x200B;

Diaper changes were and still are, a nightmare. He does NOT like them. He will grab his bum and penis so hard, his nails will dig in, causing bleeding. 

I thought it looked like his scrotum was swollen and as if there was a band around the base of his penis (uncircumsized,) as I don't have those parts, I asked my husband who said everything looked normal. 

&#x200B;

On multiple occasions, I had pulled out a very thin, light, no idea how I saw it, long hair. Not off of. OUT of. Which would cause screaming, then he would urinate the second it came out.

 I wrote the ID doctor I worked with as I thought maybe a parasite, she refused to even talk to me about it because there was no way he'd have parasites, there would be no way I'd be able to see it with the naked eye.... So I wrote his pediatrician. Same thing. Plus ""we don't get parasites in the US"" YES SHE SAID THAT. They then got together and ended up labeling me a hypochondriac and putting it in his chart. 

&#x200B;

 This lost me my job and my credibility. 

&#x200B;

Due to covid, his pediatrician didn't want to do his anemia screening until later in life, stating it wasn't that important. I switched pediatricians. 

&#x200B;

I took him in for his 2 year WC (almost a year later) with his new pediatrician, I took a chance and told her the same things. She asked why I thought he could have had it. I let her know we have family who frequently visits from the Philipines, and that we play in rivers and soil a lot ( At this time our town had a huge increase in hookworm infections, enough to be newsworthy.) She took a look and dx him with pinworms. It took two treatments.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to his CBC results which showed an ANC of 120. It had been at least 6 months since his last illness. His repeat ANC was in the 500's. A month later we did a final repeat and it was back down at 160.

&#x200B;

Last week we saw heme/onc who kept going back and forth saying ""he's very severe, almost as bad as my chemo patients,"" to, ""I'm not worried since he isn't frequently sick/ had a lot of hospitalizations."" Then went on to tell me that he most likely WILL have a lot of hospitalizations. 

No follow-up. No labs. Not even a UA. He doesn't even feel it needs to be monitored. 

&#x200B;

Normally if something isn't right, I  can feel it, this time I didn't. So I accepted it.

&#x200B;

The longer I sit on it, the more uneasy I feel. He is the only specialist in town, so a second opinion would require travel. As it's hard for me to travel due to my illnesses, I wanted to just get some opinions first. Would seeing another specialist even be a good idea, or is the first one pretty accurate? 

&#x200B;

My son tires easily, he can barely handle 30 min of PT. He has randomly thrown up, and his BMs are FOUL. He will get a temp of 99.9 when he is tired ( I know not a fever, but he acts like it is.)

AskDocs,"30F purple toes, tingling, confused and nervous","I’m a 30yo F with two kids, 195lbs, 5’8. No real medical history or conditions I’m aware of. I had an iud put in in November and removed in March. Just before the holidays my realized when sitting rhat my toes on my left foot would turn purple but upon standing up or elevating my leg, they went back to normal. I called my doctor and asked to remove the IUD bc I was convinced that was part of it. Told her about my issue and she sent me to a cardiologist to have an ultrasound on my legs to check for venous and arterial issues and to rule out a DVT. Ultrasound came back clear, pending an co silt with the cardiologist to discuss April 7th. Since then though, it affects both my feet. No real pain and not really numbness.. but a heavy feeling and sore to a degree. Definitely worse in the shower and I don’t think it’s Raynauds. 

I was vaping for a while and have quit that thinking maybe that contributed. Movement is helpful, elevation basically makes it go away. Thought it was related to a shin injury I had on the left side 3 years ago, but now that it’s both feet I’m assuming not. 

Other things I’ve noticed: scalp is super itchy and dry - could be dry weather? 
- some tingling in my fingers but contributing to muscle tightness in my shoulders 
- sometimes my feet feel burning hot and are red, I’ll try to attach some pictures 
- brittle peeling nails
- tired, but I have two kids, who isn’t tired 

Someone’s comment was deleted but I saw the beginning of it about low iron. During my pregnancy I had low iron and low ferritin, but I’m pretty sure blood work after supplements (not taking them anymore) showed it was back to normal. Thought it was pregnancy related?

Prazosin 2 mg 
Tramadal for pelvic pain 

On January 17, 2020 I went to see a doctor with complaints of breast fullness. My breasts felt heavy sometimes, they were really itchy, and the veins on my chest were very dark. This had been going on for a few months. Also experiencing really bad heartburn on a regular basis, and constant fatigue and headaches. I had also gained about 50 lbs in 3 years. My husband and I had been trying to conceive unsuccessfully for 3 years. Abnormal menses (really light and short) for about 2 years. 

Initial labs - January 17, 2020

ESR - 71 H  (ref range  0-20 mm/hr) 
Prolactin - 31 H (ref range 4.8 - 23.3 ng/mL) 
Estradiol - 667.7 H (ref range &gt;498 pg/mL)

Neut - 72.5 H (ref range 45-70) 
Pregnancy test -  negative 
Not taking any medication at the time. 
Weight in January about 215lbs

My doctor put me on antibiotics for elevated ESR and scheduled a mammogram. 

Mammogram findings- 2 benign cyst in upper right breast &amp; dense breast tissue - benign findings and unrelated to symptoms.

January 31, 2020 I had labs rechecked 

Prolactin back within normal range 17.2 
ESR lowered but still elevated at 45. 

February 14, 2020 

ESR rechecked - lower but still elevated at 32 - No more antibiotic; this was not checked again. 

I was referred to a general surgeon because my doctor wanted to rule out breast cancer. Surgeon ruled out breast cancer but ordered a brain MRI. 

MRI results - 4X3 mm adenoma on anterior pituitary gland.  

May 22, 2020 

Prolactin checked - 39 ng/mL  elevated again 

I was referred to an endocrinologist. Endocrinologist did not believe the pituitary adenoma contributed to  slightly elevated prolactin, she suspected PCOS or thyroid problems. Started 0.5 Cabergoline.

More labs - June 3, 2020

Cortisol - normal 
Thyroid profile - normal 
Globulin elevated at 3.7 g/dl 
Prolactin - <1.0 
A few other tests all normal 
Weight at the time about 220 

Endocrinologist determined no thyroid problems present and no evidence of PCOS, continued with Cabergoline. If I forget to take Cabergoline for 2 weeks or so the breast fullness comes back. 

By September my weight was about 228 lbs

Toward the end of November I was experiencing lower abdominal cramps unrelated to my period. The dull cramp began under my belly button and then spread to both sides of pelvis and my lower back. I had been experiencing discomfort during intercourse for a few months that I ignored but was getting worse as well. 

December 2, 2020 
Endocrinologist lab check 

Tsh3 - BMP - Lipid panel - prolactin - cpeptide- b12 were only labs checked. Everything within normal range except b12 noted as very low. Instructed to take 1000 mg b12 vitamins. 
Weight - 200 lbs

Discussed with endocrinologist my lower abdominal pain and she brushed it off saying it was probably nothing to worry about. 

I made an appointment to see a gynecologist anyway. 

December 9, 2020 

Initial gynecologist appointment discussed my pain and a regular pap and exam was done. Nothing abnormal noted, pap came back clear. A transvaginal ultrasound was scheduled because of my pain on 12/15/2020. 

December 12, 2020 

The pain had gotten worse and more persistent, I went to the ER. 
CT - 4X4cm partially calcified, primarily fat density mass on left ovary - possible functional cyst on right ovary - multiple enlarged non specific lymph nodes in bowel

Monocytes absolute - 0.80(10^3 uL) H (ref range 0.11-0.59 (10^3 uL)) 
RBC - 4.09(10^6uL) (ref range 4.20-5.40(10^6uL))
Anion gap - 5 mmol/L (ref range 7-16 mmol/L)
BUN - 6 mg/dL (ref range 8-20 mg/dL) 
Globulin total - 3.7 g/dL (ref range 2.8-3.3g/dL) 
Hemoglobin & Hematocrit & MPV borderline Low 

Sent home from ER - nothing emergent needed to be done. 

December 15, 2020 

Transvaginal ultrasound confirmed left ovarian mass. consult with MD scheduled for 12/21/20 to discuss OpLap for ovarian mass. 

*UPDATE* 
December 20, 2020 

Saw MD to discuss OpLap. She doesn’t believe my pelvic and hip pain are associated with ovarian mass, surgery scheduled for January. Bright red blood present in rectal exam, very painful. Likely due to enlarged lymph nodes in bowel previously found. Referred to gastroenterologist. Told to follow up with PCP about testing for autoimmune disorders. Encouraged genetic testing because of family history. 

I am now 195 lbs, I have lost 33 lbs since October. I am constantly tired, I could sleep all day everyday. I have little to no interest in any activities. Recently I’ve noticed bruises all over my legs but they don’t hurt and I don’t recall getting hurt? I have prominent dark blue veins across my chest and face. I’ve had excessive vaginal discharge. I am constantly agitated. Little to no appetite. Frequent urination. Regular headaches. I don’t know how to explain this, I just overall don’t feel well. Is it common to find 2 different tumors in your body in 1 year? Is it genetic? Could I have cancer? It’s been a rough year and I’m exhausted, I just want to feel like myself again. 

Family history: 
Maternal grandfather - Died at 29 from Lymphoma
Maternal aunt - ovarian cancer 
Maternal cousin - cervical cancer 
Maternal aunt - breast cancer 
Paternal grandfather - died of pancreatic cancer 
Paternal aunt - ovarian cancer 
Paternal grandmother - uterine cancer 
Paternal GG - breast cancer & skin cancer 
More distant relative from both sides with cancer diagnosis, these are just the closest to me.

AskDocs,19F with breathing problems,"Hi. I’m 19F, 5’4”, 135 lbs (currently pregnant I’d normally be around 105 lbs), Caucasian. I’m experiencing a lot of what I think are concerning symptoms. They’ve been happening since before I was pregnant but especially in the last month (I’m 33 weeks in) they’ve gone insane. I occasionally have chest pain on my left side although it does not spread to my arm or up my neck it does spread down my ribs in almost a straight line. I also experience burning pain taking a full breath as though I’ve been out running in the cold or held my breath too long underwater (unless normal people don’t get that). The main concern I have is randomly while standing up or sitting down I will feel as though I’m not getting enough oxygen. I can take a full breath just fine but it doesn’t feel like breathing is doing anything to help me gain oxygen. I feel light headed when this happens and often end up breathing faster but not more heavily if that makes sense. My friend had one of those devices you put onto your finger to measure oxygen levels and during an attack she offered it to me and my oxygen level was 99% but my heart rate was over 130 BPM. It calmed down after about five minutes but never went below 100 BPM. Every time I’ve tried measuring during an attack my heart rate has been at least 130 BPM and my oxygen absorption has been fine. Every time I’ve had my blood pressure taken at a doctor appointment (which is frequent lately given my pregnancy) it’s been exactly 100/60. I do want to stress that these symptoms have happened before the pregnancy they’ve just worsened as the pregnancy continued. Every doctor I’ve brought this up with has waved it away as normal for pregnancy which I can’t believe seeing as it’s only gotten worse with being pregnant. The symptoms already existed before. I’m not currently diagnosed with anything (excepting some mental stuff consisting of high functioning autism, depression and anxiety but I know what all of those feel like and this is not them) although I have another medical issue I could talk about that has been ignored as well. I don’t think it’s related. I am not currently on any medication barring prenatals and Tagamet. I do not drink, smoke or do drugs. I used to smoke but only four or so cigarettes a day and the symptoms did exist before smoking and were not worsened. Please just someone tell me if I’m in trouble. It’s worsening to the point I can’t take a shower without having to get out to sit down and try to breathe. (Just in case I do want to clarify I don’t know if this is really bad or not so I don’t mean to violate any rule if this is an emergency. It would be News to me if it is as no doctor has taken me seriously. I’m hoping to gain some sort of information about what might be going on so I can talk to a doctor about it and maybe they’ll actually take me seriously instead of just brushing aside my concerns as usual)",1,3,2021-04-10,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Lots of symptoms and no diagnoses...anxiety or just atypical?,"Brace yourself for a long one.

36F, BMI\~31, never smoker, recently cut back on drinking (moderate prior to that), no recreational drugs, c-section last May (first-time mom) for breech presentation, Hashimoto's, anxiety/depression (has been under control for 10+ years with buproprion), stopped prog-only birth control \~2 weeks ago, recently started amoxicillin for acne.

I am looking for any insights anyone might have on what's going on...what's the most likely diagnos(es) for someone my age and relative health? Aside: my regular physician left my network before all of this started so I ended up seeing a random nurse practitioner who seemed to have no clue and just made a bunch of referrals to specialists. The order in which I saw these specialists was based solely on availability. I have no idea which things might be related or cause for concern and which things are simply concurrent signs of age/lifestyle/recent pregnancy/stress so just going to list everything I can think of knowing it's probably not all relevant.

Sx: 

The big things: for at least 2 months, experiencing shortness of breath with chest/abdominal heaviness, fatigue, and lightheadedness. It is worse with activity but the lightheadedness is always there to some degree (from the time I wake up until I go to bed). At first I only felt it while on the treadmill, but now it's basically any activity, even just standing washing the dishes. I've also had vertigo (feeling of movement) with nausea from time to time.  I am still able to do things, but I really have to push myself and it is unpleasant and tiring and frankly kind of scary, so most of the time I limit activity to work and taking care of the baby. 

The other things: for about a month I have noticed upper abdominal bloating/early satiety (maybe 50% of the time) which sometimes feels like it is directly causing the SOB--or at least makes it worse. I've had gas, nausea, and abdominal cramping but it is not severe and occurs in multiple places (unaffected by pressing on the painful areas). No constipation, diarrhea occasionally but short-lived, no blood that I've noticed. I do often find it difficult to empty bladder completely though. I've started keeping a food diary to see if anything correlates to symptoms but it's been difficult to be diligent about it, especially with the brain fog.

I've also had worsening back pain that I often wake up with. I do have a disc herniation c5/c6, but in Oct when I had last cervical MRI it was not impinging on the spinal cord (just moderate left-side foraminal stenosis). The cervical pain I feel now is very familiar and causes headaches. However, the lower back pain that I've experienced since pregnancy has gotten worse over the last few months, and the completely new pain is mid-back. All three areas of pain feel qualitatively different and bother me at different times. The pain is strong enough to be distracting and somewhat limiting but not excruciating...because of possible digestive issues I have stayed away from ibuprofen/aspirin/etc., but heat helps a little. A weird sensation I've assumed is related to the pain is in my left foot I often feel a combination of tingling/numbness or tightness like I'm wearing a sock. Sometimes it's just my toes, sometimes my whole foot, and sometimes the feeling goes up my ankle and lower calf. It has never progressed beyond that and does not feel alarming or like it's getting worse, but it is new in the last 2 months. (Perhaps now I should add that last summer I experienced dysesthesia in my hands and feet that whenever I touched anything produced that nails on chalkboard feeling...it resolved itself after about 2 months, neurologist suspected transverse myelitis and did the MRI mentioned above but there were no abnormalities). 

Finally, last month I had 3 full menstrual periods (basically about 2 weeks apart each). Some cramping but otherwise seemed normal. After the third one I decided I'd had enough of the birth control, assuming the extra bleeding is due to stress and the prog-only pill. I did consult my OB and she was not concerned but we did do a pelvic ultrasound to make sure nothing weird was going on there (observed a presumed follicular cyst < 2mm on one ovary but nothing else).

What we've tested/tried so far:

Upon examination, no one has noted oddities with heartbeat, breathing, or abdominal palpation. My blood pressure in general has been reading high some days but not all days, generally between 120-140/80-100, heart rate and pulse ox normal. 

Negative home pregnancy tests in February/early March, no sex since then so pretty sure that's not it.

No current or recent coronavirus infection...both viral and antibody tests negative.

Fasting glucose 79, normal CBC and metabolic panel. TSH was 2.94 on 3/4 and then endocrinologist bumped up levothyroxine dose slightly to 88mcg because I'm considering another baby in the future. 

First I tried famotidine for the heavy chest feeling--didn't necessarily feel like reflux but we thought we'd try it. Didn't seem to help though. Recently tried a 14-day course of omeprazole but that has also not resolved any of the main symptoms. H. pylori stool test was negative.

Normal chest x-ray and ECG. Treadmill stress test showed no arrhythmias or other oddities, except that I was symptomatic and blood pressure was a little weird. Comments on report were: early tachycardic response to low-level exercise and hypotensive BP response to exercise w/normal resting BP. Of course I considered deconditioning, but seems unlikely given that I started working out in December and had actually made a lot of progress on getting back into shape by the time symptoms began). Echo was normal also. Cardiologist had low suspicion for heart problem given the normal tests but because my last cholesterol reading was high and there's family history of CAD I am going to do CT angio coronary/calcium scoring next week.

D-dimer negative with low suspicion for PE. No cough, wheezing, or typical chest pain. Lung function tests were normal. I tried albuterol inhaler for a while but that did not help. I saw a wonderful pulmonologist who had low suspicion that this is lung-related but we're doing a CT angio chest/PE study next week as well. (I'm not sure why this is being done separately--can anyone tell me how this is different from the CT coronary angio?) ...Related? - I do have pain near my armpits and near breast...feels like muscle pain, is tender and bilateral. I have very little breast tissue (little fat but also deficiency of mammary gland, no change during pregnancy and never was able to make more than 1 oz breastmilk at a time despite herculean efforts) so it's difficult for me to tell whether internal sensations there are actually in the breast or muscle or what. I've not felt any lumps or other weirdness though. 

Lastly, I saw a neurologist and it was unfortunately the worst appointment I've ever had. Maybe we didn't have great rapport or maybe he just needs improvement as a doctor I don't know, but it felt dismissive and rushed. He asked few specific questions and actually wrote more in his notes (I can access online) than he actually communicated to me in person. The impression I was left with was, ""there's nothing I can do for your nonspecific symptoms, but you can have this brain MRI if it'll make you feel better."" >\_< Because he offered nothing else, I scheduled that for next week too. 

Yes, I have considered the possibility that this is anxiety. In fact, I know that at the very least anxiety is exacerbating whatever is going on. I believe I have legitimately had panic attacks since this started and I do have a history of anxiety. I've started therapy to address that possibility and to cope. I don't feel like that's all that's going on, but I do HOPE that's the case. I really just want to feel better and get back to my life.

AskDocs,A bunch of symptoms & 2 ER visits… they still say nothing is wrong.,"I’m 24F, a month ago was at 190lb and am down now to about 180. Pre-existing conditions include BPD, asthma, allergies. I take lamictal, Zyrtec, vit D, magnesium, collagen, and a multivitamin daily. As of 1 week ago I’ve also been taking Prilosec. No chance of pregnancy. 

Background: I love food. I’m a snack all day kind of person. I love going out to eat and getting takeout. Not wanting food is not in my character. Also, since late fall I have had on and off issues with my stomach. More often then not, I’d be making multiple semi-soft BMs a day and have terrible gas all of the time. I saw my doctor about this and blood sugar concerns and everything came up fine. 

For just about the past month, I have been experiencing constant nausea, with intermittent vomiting and low appetite. At that point I had chalked it up to stress. Since the 30th, I have felt exceedingly nauseous. On that day I felt like I could not swallow without thinking about it. Dramamine got me through the day, but symptoms persisted. The next week I was vomiting fairly consistently. Food was completely repulsive and I could only get myself to eat one small meal or nurse a bowl of pasta or rice for hours. I was trying everything to get through the week and go to work. Emetrol seemed to help the most,
But I was also taking bonine and ginger gum. I was constantly drinking ginger ale and pedialyte. Through the weekend I had slowed down on vomiting and actively started dry heaving fairly often. All sorts of things would trigger me to start dry heaving from having a conversation, coughing, brushing my teeth and once I started dry heaving I could not stop except it wasn’t a normal kind of dry heaving it felt like my body was going through all of the motions of puking right down to how my throat was contracting but nothing was coming up. I had a stressful weekend following that week so when it got worse on the weekend I had chalked it up to anxiety again. Ultimately it got even worse during the tail end of the weekend into the next morning so my partner got me to agree to urgent care. 

At urgent care appointed to the top part of my stomach right over the base of my ribs where I was feeling some centralized pain and described other symptoms including tarry stool movements at this point and away decreased bowel pattern versus my normal. The PA was concerned that it might have something to do with my gallbladder so urged me to go to the emergency department as soon as possible. At the emergency room they did blood tests ultrasounds and CT scans and everything came back within normal limits except for some small something in my kidney however that would’ve been unrelated to the symptoms according to them. They prescribed me Prilosec and sent me on my way.Upon reviewing the tests results during the week I saw I had high neutro absolute, low mpv, and 111 glucose. 

Ultimately symptoms persisted for the next week up until yesterday when I woke up extremely nauseous and then could not stop sleeping all day. I wake up for about 15 minutes out of time every couple of hours and hardly had enough energy to get myself to the kitchen for water or food. I ultimately was able to get myself up around 430 to eat some soup and go to my teletherapy appointment. When that ended at 6 o’clock I immediately fell back asleep and then my partner had to wake me up for a joint zoom call For 7 o’clock. After that ended at eight we talked for about an hour and ordered food. While waiting for the food I fell back asleep however when it arrived I could barely wake myself up or keep my eyes open. I could feel my heart racing and my hands and legs started spasming randomly. It’s sort of felt like that feeling when you’re falling asleep and feel like you’re falling. When I got up to go to the bathroom I felt like I was going to faint and my head was spinning. To note: I am on my period however it only lasted lightly for one day and typically it’s very regular coming the same time each month lasting five days. 

I could feel very much that something was not right in my body I am not the kind of person to want to go to the emergency room but felt that I needed to. I was not overtired and had no reason to be sleeping all day let alone not being able to keep my eyes open at all or finish a sentence without falling asleep in the middle of it. The best way I can describe how I was feeling was like a computer moving in and out of sleep mode. At the emergency room I hardly had enough energy to explain to admissions what was going on and know that I did not explain it completely upfront. I noticed in the waiting room that my hands were very swollen and none of my rings could even move on my fingers. Once we were seen I had my partner explain all of what was going on better to the nurse and to the doctor. The doctor ran more blood tests including some thing on my thyroid but everything to my knowledge came back normal. They did no tests other than bloodwork. They gave me at least one bag of Celine I was sleeping so I don’t remember if they put the second bag that they mentioned up or not. They gave me a Zofran prescription and discharged me.

Today I am still feeling incredibly sluggish and tired. I am feeling a little bit more hungry than I have but still can’t eat much at one time. I think that is due to the Zofran. 

What my question is is that is there anything here symptom wise that they may be missing? I find it hard to believe that this is all just nothing.",1,1,2021-06-18,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Just a heart question.,"Hey you wonderful medical personal/interested individuals. I (43F) 5’8, 165 lbs, 4 months post partum, preexisting mild POTS (managed with 25 mg metoprolol), mild mitral valve leak, ADHD (30 mg Vyvanse), G8 P6 developed heart failure in my last and final pregnancy. My PCP missed it and it was quite stressful figuring it out after the complicated delivery  (failed induction 3x at 38 weeks, and CS at 39+2. Discovered placenta acreta in my cervix during the surgery, spinal wore off and needed a general to finish the surgery. In pregnancy, had issues with relentless palpitations, tachycardia (which was controlled with 50 mg bid metoprolol) short of breath all the time, chest discomfort laying on my back and left side, audible crackling in chest inhaling and exhaling, and pitting edema up legs. Understandably, symptoms were chalked up to advanced maternal age, pregnancy, and low iron (had 4 iron infusions.) 

Was given an X-ray upon discharge, was diagnosed with enlarged left ventricle and fluid in lungs, and was prescribed furosemide in decreasing amounts over a month, and was to maintain metoprolol. Had an echo 2 weeks postpartum which showed a significant mitral valve leak, but left ventricle had reduced to normal size. Cardiologist recommended maintaining medication until TEE at 8 weeks postpartum.

At TEE, heart showed full recovery from pregnancy (🎉) and was back to mild mitral valve leak that was preexisting and only needed to be monitored every 2-3 years. 

So -my question... I have chest discomfort when laying on my back. It’s been a couple weeks, but my colour is good, blood pressure, pulse ox normal, no edema in legs or lung issues - just discomfort (pressure in chest) and just laying down, so definitely not emergent. 

Since I was just told 6weeks ago everything was fine, I don’t know what this would be or if it’s even worth phoning my cardiologist on Monday about.

AskDocs,Period is late and I’m having unusual pelvic pain.,"
27 Female. 275lbs. 5 foot 6 inches. White Have ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. I don’t smoke or drink. Period is late and I’m having weird pelvic pain that started this weekend. I am not currently sexually active, so pregnancy is not a possibility. I was recently hospitalized for depression and anxiety at the beginning of January. Medications:
Vyvanse 50mg
Prestiq 50mg(new)
Buspirone 10mg twice a day (new)
Quetiapine 100 mg (new)
Trazodone 200mg

started amoxicillin today due to a test showing my white blood cells being a little high. 

My story is that my last period was over 7 weeks ago, (December 14th). Was recently hospitalized for my depression and anxiety at the beginning of January. That’s when I started all of the medication marked new.  Started having weird cramps this past weekend. But period hasn’t started. I then realized that my period is really late. Normally I have a 28 day cycle. 

I get into my PCP on Monday.  She figures my period is late due to my recent stress levels from my hospital stay but takes some blood to test just to be sure. Results come back Wednesday and everything looks fine except my white blood cells were a little high and so she’s started me on amoxicillin. 

Since Monday, my cramps I’m have gotten worse and they just seem off. Still the normal pain level I experience during my period, but it feels weird, like there’s added pressure? 

Then this morning, I get a very sharp intense pain that is very localized in like a golf ball size area in my right pelvic area. This really concerned me, because I’ve never felt this type of pain before. Like... I’ve I had kidney stone pain that was similar but this was worse and didn’t move. It only lasted for a few minutes but I was really concerned so I called the doctor. 

She prescribed me Provera to help with my period, but I haven’t started it yet because I wasn’t able to get to the pharmacy yet. But since my phone call this morning, the stabbing pain has happened twice more and my cramping has gotten worse and it just feels wrong!? 

 I just don’t feel like how I normally feel before a period! And this new pain has got me really worried! And I feel really bloated i think, it just feels like there’s a lot of pressure in my lower abdomen.But my moods have been all over the place the past month so I can’t tell if I actually have reason to be worried and I need to press the issue further with my PCP or if I am overreacting and just need to let my body sort itself out.

 (Beside some seafood reaction and mild come and go eczema, never have any other allergy or problems)

So it started out in early June (second trimester), I noticed some rash going on underneath my breast and few days later some pustules formed around the area (I found myself more sweaty there) . Then the next few days it spreads to around the belly. It's not itchy nor burning, just very gross looking. [1](http://imgur.com/a/WtZTbwJ) [2](http://imgur.com/a/yFHwarx)

My ob gave me some anti fungal cream which kind of stopped it from spreading, however a 2 weeks later it came back again and spreading slowing to thighs and arms, especially underneath the breast. It's a bit itchy but I can manage myself not to scratch it.

The same time some little red bumps showed up on my arms that's super itchy. But after I tried my best not to scratch it, it just became normal except leaving a rough surface. [3](http://imgur.com/a/n1qaaLv)

I went to the dermatologist and she did a skin biopsy on my thigh (which was at first itchy and then suddenly lot of pustules formed within a day or two) [4](http://imgur.com/a/YZ1U1bm) It is "" mixes infiltrate with papillary dermal edema, spongiosis, and subcorneal pustule formation"" And she told me to stop using the anti fungal cream just keep the area clean and dry since not sure what it is.

But after that it got a lot worse, it's spread to everywhere (except my face , hands and feet) and became bigger area with dark red rash underneath. My thigh was the worst, it feels like burning and tingling, so it's hard to walk too. [today, same biopsy site](http://imgur.com/a/lSH2fKi)

She gave me Keflex antibiotics and now I'm on 6th day, it's not improving and most area are still spreading. I had the worse night ever last night because most places just have burning tingly sensation, plus it's all over my belly and thigh, so it hurts a lot when trying to move around.

Called my dermatologist this morning, she said bacterial culture came back negative, still waiting for DIF biosy result. But both her and my OB advised me to go to a university dermatology since it seems pretty rare.

AskDocs,Next step - failed weight loss surgery,"Hello, please know I am an open book and whiling to answer questions but the answer to my question isn’t “higher output then input” if this is your answer please respect I won’t reply. 

I am a 29y female 120kg(260lb), 5’ tall, PCOS with infertility, asthma when playing sports or in cold conditions, currently coming off Escitalopram with a history of steroid use for body building. Caucasian.

In 2015 I had weight loss surgery (gastric sleeve) to loss weight after gaining 50kg(110lb) in the space of 12 months (broken ankle requiring multiple surgeries and months of bed rest) and not being able to loose it at the advise of my then GP/PCP. Pre surgery I had to do a VLCD aka shake diet for 2 weeks in which I lost 3kg (which I believe was water weight as it was the first couple of days) then 2kg post surgery. 

It is coming up to 5 years and my weight has not moved, not a single kg/lb, I had a baby 6 months ago and walked out from having the baby at exactly (I cannot stress this enough) the same weight only gaining 4kg the day before having the baby(weekly weigh ins). I have spoken to a new go/pcp who simply advised I was over eating and not exercising enough. I have seen an endocrinologist who has tested me for many things, tried me on injections for weight loss which also did nothing, had me on excessively high calorie diet to see if I could gain weight which I didn’t and then excessively low calorie diet to loose weight again which I didn’t. I have been advised my next step would be to have gastric bypass surgery which I personally don’t feel like would work as I am not an over eater. 

A brief history, I have always been short I am 5’ (151cm) extremely fit and weighing in around 50kg (110lb) for most of my life, as well as an ex body builder in the bikini division where I did take an illegal substance Clenbuterol during my last competition I am not sure if this is a factor. I have also had PCOS since I was 14 with a period every 6 months for 2 days but fell pregnant with my son at 19. But with this baby was 2 years of trying with fertility medication. My blood pressure has always been reasonably low (even during pregnancy) 100/50?, do not have fatty liver, hba1 4.2, low cholesterol.  Not sure if it is relevant but my pregnancy ended in waters breaking at 31 weeks.  

An example of my diet is coffee for breakfast, either a sausage or chicken sandwich for lunch, dinner, and a snack size packet of chips for dessert. I cannot consume more then a fist sized amount of food. 

So basically I am unsure how to proceed. I understand I will not return to the small person I was but physically my body is suffering and I would like to loose a reasonable amount.",3,7,2020-05-20,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Is it possible for me to be 29 weeks pregnant and not know it?,"22F, 5’7, 193 lbs, Caucasian, no current medications, vape frequently, drink socially (but very occasionally) 

On August 18th, 2020, I had unprotected sex but used the pullout method. I was ovulating during this time. About a month afterwards I started feeling nauseous and moody along with a few other typical pregnancy symptoms. I also had some light spotting that lasted about 3.5 days, which is very unlike my normal heavy-flow period that lasts 7-8 days. I took an at-home test and it came back negative, so I chalked it up to intense emotional stress, as the person I had sex with on the 18th was an ex boyfriend of mine whom had just suddenly decided to remove himself from my life. 

For the next few months after that, my “periods” continued to be the same, light spotting for a few days, which I have never experienced prior to the first time I mentioned. My periods have been on and off irregular over the years but have never been that short nor light. 

I have not thought about this at all since the negative test, but it came to mind again being I have not gotten my period yet. My last period was a little heavier than past months but still not the usual for me. I haven’t been keeping track of my periods either, but I have to be at least 2-3 weeks late now. 

I have had a lot of schedule changes in the past month and have also gained about 10-12 pounds, which I know are significant factors that can affect the menstrual cycle-so perhaps it is invalid for me to even question this, I’m not sure. I think the reason why I am concerned is because of the light periods I have had for months along with the initial symptoms. 

Obviously, a test or doctors visit would be the only way to know, but if my HCG levels weren’t high enough when I tested at what would have been 6 weeks pregnant, could it still not show up now? 

I don’t have a PCP so it would be difficult for me to set up an ultrasound, and frankly, I would feel uncomfortable as I do feel this could be out of pocket. 

It could be, but nonetheless I am having a lot of anxiety over this, especially as I’ve noticed today that my stomach is protruding a lot more than it was just a few days ago. I have noticed it becoming larger due to the weight gain but it seriously feels big now, and also like it’s kind of forcing itself to stick out.

I guess the question is-Doctors-how common are situations like these in your experience? Is it possible that I could be?",0,3,2021-02-10,stress during pregnancy

- Increase in appetite; no food aversions or cravings, just a general increase in appetite.

- Pimples; I'm not sure if this should count as a symptom, but I'm not usually the type to get pimples, and 3 pimples have appeared on my face in the past week.

\- DVT / Mother

\- Breast Cancer / Maternal Grandmother

**Current Meds:**

\-Cymbalta 20mg

\-Trazodone 50mg

\-Aspirin 325mg

**Background/Story:**

I went to see an OB in April because my spouse and I have been wanting to get pregnant. We had been trying for a few months with no success. Granted, our sex life isn't great.

The OB did a lot of tests and also an ultrasound - found no issues with my hormones, ovaries, or uterus. I know I am morbidly obese and this affects my chances of pregnancy, but having a medical background I know obese women can get pregnant w/o issues. I do not have PCOS. He also tested spouse's sperm count/motility, with no issues.

Anyway, since he found no issues on either end, he decided to put me on Clomid. I asked him if this would make me susceptible to developing blood clots due to my Factor V Leiden deficiency, because I know sometimes fertility/hormonal affecting meds can cause increased coaguability and he straight out said ""No, there should be no issue.""

So, I took two rounds of Clomid. The 2nd round was done by mid-May. Did not get pregnant.

Instead, I got a blood clot in my lower right leg. Basically the side of my calf started turning really red and getting swollen over a few days, and this was about a week after the 2nd round had finished. I went to Urgent Care and they referred me to the ER so that I could have an Ultrasound done. They found a Superficial Blood Clot in my Great Sapphenous Vein. They also did a Chest CT, but didn't find any evidence of a Pulmonary Embolism. The ER Physician decided he did not want to prescribe me blood thinners and just advised me to take 325mg Aspirin daily.

Doing this, taking Ibuprofen, using IcyHot for pain management, and keeping it elevated when at home - the symptoms gradually got better, and then got worse. Mind you, between then I had seen my PCP and she did not decide to put me on blood thinners but did refer me to an Interventional Cardiologist and ordered a repeat Ultrasound, which I sat on for a bit because like I said the clot seemed to had gotten better and I didn't want to spend another $400 on an Ultrasound.

In early July the symptoms had gotten so bad again during one of my shifts and I was feeling short of breath, so my coworkers made me go to the ER. After a 3 hour wait, the ER doc pressed around on my foot, said he thought it was cellulitis, prescribed some steroids and antibiotics and discharged me. I felt like he didn't take any of my past history or the concerns I had voiced to him seriously.

As for the repeat Ultrasound, I ended up biting the bullet and got it done last week, which basically just showed the clot is still there, and has grown in size, extending down across my foot, which I pretty much already knew because this is where the pain was.

I can actually feel the vein where the clot is - it is very hard and feels like it has sclerosed.

As of right now, it is super painful to bear weight on it. It is swollen again and hot to the touch - a very angry foot. :(

**My questions/concerns:**

Would it be worthwhile to go on a Blood Thinner? Obviously Aspirin and supportive care aren't doing anything for the clot. I can't see the point in just letting it be because otherwise it is just going to impair my quality of life and potentially affect the perfusion to my leg, and also risk going deeper into my venous system and then going to my lung.

Also, do they even do surgical intervention for a superficial blood clot? At this point, I wouldn't mind going this route if it is even a thing.

**TL/DR:** I have spent over $1,000 on a blood clot that I got because my OB didn't take into consideration that the Clomid he prescribed me can indeed cause blood clots, especially in people with predisposition (e.g. Factor V Leiden). I just want it to be gone and need advice on how to proceed/what even can be done.

Also FTR, I will be changing OB's. :)

AskDocs,Eye Twitching for Seven Months Straight,"29F, 5’2, 160lb

My upper right eyelid has been twitching every few minutes while awake for over seven months now (it lets up at night). I had a full physical and eye exam last Feb, when the twitching had been happening for about a month. Clean bill of health minus slightly high cholesterol. I was told it’s multi-factorial caused by all the following:
Sleep deprivation from new baby
Stress/anxiety (I have GAD)
I work in advertising and can spend easily 10+ hours a day in front of a computer. 
And the cherry on top, I have very stubborn eczema on my eyelids that flared up during pregnancy (treating and mostly cleared up, but chronically irritated eyelids). 

My doctor recommended trying to relax and sleep more and stare at the computer less. I’ve managed to accomplish 2 of the 3 - taking breaks from my work is a challenge. I’ve since moved states and the twitching has kept on keeping on. I have no other concerning vision/neurological symptoms. The twitching has stayed consistently the same. 

The twitching has become a source of anxiety in itself and Dr Google is not good company. Is it possibly something more sinister that I should be worrying about at this point? Haven’t setup with a new physician yet.",3,5,2020-08-14,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,"Postpartum Preeclampsia, Granuloma(s), and Other Conditions - What do I do?","34 yr old Female; I have several issues that developed after delivering my baby in November of last year and they’re being treated separately. I feel stupid asking if there is something else going on but could there be some other issue?

The pregnancy was perfectly on time and up until a few hours before delivery my blood pressure had been fine. We went to the hospital after contractions reached the appropriate interval (though water hadn’t broken) and BP spiked enough that they decided not to send me home because of minimal dilation. Then I was induced. BP remained high during labor and 2 days of recovery but was written off as stress and lack of sleep (26 hour labor).

3 days after release my baby was admitted to ER for hypothermia and my BP was hitting ~170/125. I was admitted later the same day to a different ward (husband hung with kiddo in the PICU). I was on the floor for a week trying to get the BP down - they said it was Postpartum Preeclampsia. Finally got a cocktail of drugs that’s keeping it low enough but I’m still above average, even now, on Labadelol and Nifedipine.

I also had a lot of pain from tearing / stitches that I initially thought was just inflammation from the catheter. The OB said it would go away but after 6 weeks it was still painful to pee (like pissing barbed wire) and hard to walk. She said it was totally normal and I felt a little dismissed but she finally looked and found a granuloma had formed where the stitches had been. She used silver nitrate and ‘burned’ it off but it came back or a new one developed? This happened two more times, the third silver nitrate treatment at the 3 month postpartum mark seemed like it had worked.

But just today my husband and I tried to have sex and it was so painful. We took a look and there is a bright red line of tissue, like the granuloma(s) came back?!

On top of that my finger and toe nails all have a raised horizontal ridge; I assumed it was just because of a swift change in nutrients now that baby is out but my husband said he heard that could be serious.

I don’t know. I just feel like I’m losing my mind because there are so many disparate things - I know my body is very different now but I feel like I’m being dismissed when my experience actually far outside of normal. Any ideas what could be going on and how to treat?",3,1,2021-04-09,stress during pregnancy

As I mentioned my issues are majorly hormone related. Since the age of 16 I have been on birth control, started with the depo shot(16-20). At age 20 I had my first child.mirena IUD, that caused a tubal pregnancy resulting I surgical removal of pregnancy and iud (20-22) implanon in arm (25-28). Had 2nd child at 28 and had tubes tied during c-section. Remained birth control free until 31 due to constant depressive episodes anxiety breakdowns panic attacks in addition with irregular menstrual cycles weight loss and gain so the dr suggested hormone therapy so im on implanon with tied tubes currently.
In the last 4 years I have experienced the following symptoms regularly.
Heavy blood clotted periods lasting approx 10 days, period would stop for 3-5 days then start again with heavy flow and clotting for 7-10 days. Cramping.

Diagnosed medical conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, GERD, depression, hemochromatosis 


Some medical history: Was 315 pounds in January 2019. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy 6/3/19 at 282 pounds. Sleeve surgery caused GERD but otherwise no complications. Keyhole cholecystectomy done 6/12/20. 30-40 gallstones removed with gallbladder. 3 pregnancies with two live births via c section in 2010 and 2016 and a miscarriage in 2015

Supplements: Solimo multivitamin, Caltrate calcium chews, Nature's Bounty hair skin and nails.

When I was obese my blood pressure was borderline for hypertension when not pregnant. When pregnant with my first child I developed pre-eclampsia and my second child gestational hypertension as a result of my weight while pregnant.

Since I started losing weight my blood pressure gradually dropped at every appointment which would be expected as I reached a healthier weight. Since late summer/early fall it's been running in the low end of normal like 95/63. My doctor comments on it being low but hasn't been concerned.

During December I began having issues with the reflux where I was on omeprazole but it wasn't working anymore. Constant sore throat, abdominal pain and heartburn. 12/29 my PCP put me on pantoprazole and famitodine. Blood pressure was 87/59 but doctor didn't say much beyond saying it might be because I was struggling to eat and drink. I have been referred to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy. Last one was done by my bariatric surgery hospital in 2019. PCP is concerned about an ulcer or barrett's esophagus.

Within a few days of starting the new medication i was eating and drinking fairly normally or at least normal for me. As a bariatric patient my intake for calories is around 1100-1200 a day when I am feeling well.

I saw my rheumatologist yesterday 1/8 for a routine visit for my arthritis. My blood pressure was 84/56. I mentioned my fatigue hasn't gotten better although my arthritis pain is fairly well managed between voltaren and cbd. I was taking  naproxen once a day which is  the max my bariatric surgeon  said I could have but stopped at the direction of my pcp because of the reflux.

I have been chalking up my fatigue to stress from both my kids having special needs and the older child having numerous mental health crisis situations in the last few months. My rheumatologist thinks it is possible I could  just be tired from my job and  kids but wants me to have my pcp refer me for a sleep apnea study.

I don't know if everything is related or not. But why would my blood pressure be this low and when is it so low I should be concerned? What could be causing it?",3,2,2021-01-09,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Thoracic Aoritc Aneurysm: How terrified should I actually be?,"So last month I almost died from diabetic ketoacidosis. Before that I didn't even know I was diabetic. Still waiting on test results to rule out T2 vs LADA.  In the process of doing a CT scan during that whole thing they accidentally found a 4.5cm aneurism on my ascending aorta. I'm not sure if it's relevant or not but I had a stress test and echocardiogram almost exactly a year prior with no note of any such thing (I'm not sure if that's something you'd actually detect with an echocardiogram though?) 

The notes from the hospital say there is no significant stenosis and my arteries are parent. But I did have severe pre-eclampsia and HELLP with my daughter 5 years ago. My blood pressure never really went back to normal after that and I've been on meds since (although for a period at first I was not very good about them). 

One thing I noticed when I was in the ICU was that my BP was actually quite low. I kept asking them if they had given me my BP meds because it was sort of alarming to me. Usually if I don't take my meds it will shoot up. They hadn't and they just kept shrugging it off like it was irrelevant (maybe it was but it bothered me and no one ever gave me an explanation for it)

I also had what I thought per my now former family doctor was asthma or a type of reactive airway disease. I get these bouts where my chest or lungs kind of squeeze and then I cough and it squeezes more, round we go. Sometines it down we come with an obvious URI but other times it's been mid summer and I don't have any other symptoms of a chest cold. This happened actually right before I ended up in the hospital and I was given a 10 day course of prednisone (something that I've had many times before) which is probably what really took my blood sugar over the edge. The attending in the hospital (who was a pulmonologist apparently) was very clear I don't have and he said my symptoms were caused by postnasal drip and GERD. I do have a postnasal drip but I've never really had heartburn in my life before the ketoacidosis outside of pregnancy. 

I have an appointment with a cardiologist coming up in November. That's a pretty fast turnaround for a specialist around here but it's an eternity for me. I'm really stressed out about it (which doesn't help I'm sure) I'm a single mom of the most amazing 5 year old girl in the universe and I don't want to drop dead. Dr. Google only makes me more anxious. 

I'm almost 43. I'm 5'4"" and now about 190lbs. I dropped about 50 lbs in the maybe 2-3 months right before I wound up in the hospital (probably should have been a clue something was wrong). My blood sugar is now perfect and well controlled with insulin and diet. Besides the preeclampsia the only other thing I can think of that could be relevant is a history of anxiety disorders (which is probably obvious lol). 

Please tell me I'm not going to drop dead.",4,3,2020-10-14,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Health anxiety causing this?,"I had stomach issues for about a month, made lifestyle changes, took Pepcid for 2 weeks, probiotics, no juices/wine/spicy foods etc. For the last three days, I realized I felt better. Now my allergies/cold has started and I have become aware that it seems like when I swallow food, it seems to go down slowly and I can feel it. I can't seem to tell if it's been like this for a while and I just didn't realize it  or if it's the phlegmy gunk and inflamed throat. It's at the base of my neck, I feel like a lump (not painful) and then under that, like behind the breastbone it seems like food is stuck or going down down slowly. I have no trouble swallowing but it seems like I might, like I'm on the verge of not being able to swallow. Now, of course, I'm nervous about eating. 

What I'm worried about-that it's something ominous with my esophagus. My gastroenterologist says for me to come in. Said this food issue could be GERD, from my allergies or anxiety. I am worried because I used to smoke in high school/college and I guess it's always in the back of my mind. I am 49, female, fit, healthy diet, exercise regularly. I was having a couple glasses of wine with dinner most days but I cut that out.  I am worried it could be Barrett's esophagus or worse.

I have had bouts of health anxiety, to be perfectly honest.  I also grew up with a doctor father so I have a more enhanced knowledge of disease that ""regular"" people. I do remember the throat thing when I was about 21 and I looked at my online medical charts and I had seen my ENT in 2019 complaining about something similar and he noted ""globus"", possible GERD.  

I have never had symptoms of reflux except during pregnancy. Could GERD be silent and do something to my esophagus causing food to appear to go down slowly? Am I just paying attention to my eating and focusing on swallowing so it seems abnormal? My primary care said my stomach thing could also be anxiety/stress. Can anxiety/stress actually cause all my symptoms?! I don't want to dismiss something as ""in my head"" if it's actually real and something serious.",1,1,2021-02-25,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,"Chronic exhaustion, multiple illnesses in short amt of time.","I'm a 41F, married w/ 4 children. Medications include Vyvanse, Pristiq (for premenstrual dysphoric disorder) multivitamins, & magnesium.

My question requires some back story, & you'll soon see why it's relevant. 
The amount of stress I've been under in the last 10 years has been astronomical:

-getting out of poverty 
-moving every 2 years w/husband's jobs
-bed rests for multiple pregnancies (7 pregnancies in 9 yrs, 4 living children, 3.5 years *total accumulated* time spent vomiting uncontrollably, or on bed rest, during that time) 
-I've had little continuity of care, except for OB issues, because of moving across multiple counties or states. 
-All six family members have ADHD + other issues. My two youngest kids have sleep disorders. My husband has OCD & ASD. This means that, since my 3rd daughter was born, I've likely only slept in 2 hour intervals, for abt 9 years. 
-My oldest daughter has a rare combination of illnesses that I basically had to research & develop a treatment for. ADHD, OCD, SPD, ASD, & a pediatric eating disorder. She didn't eat the day she was born. She's been through 3 sessions of Maudsley Refeeding, 1 hospitalization, & finally stabilized once we got the ADHD + OCD treated properly.

This is just necessary background info incase someone says, ""You're just stressed out! Sleep! Go on vacation!"" I can't do that. The kids are 6-15 yrs old.

Since last year, I've started catching up on over a decade of missed sleep. I've slept in as long as I've needed to, since August of 2019, & my husband has done the lions share of, ""getting kids ready for school,"" so I could begin the road to recovery from all this. 
However, I've been getting ""sick,"" w/cold or flu symptoms, once or twice a month since then. There's never anything wrong---no fever, nothing on a chest X-ray, no mononucleosis, no strep---no identifiable *reason* why I should be so vulnerable as my body is FINALLY getting the sleep it needs. 
During the Pandemic, I've developed a severe migraine issue that I now take Nortryptaline, 25 MG for. I've also had more extended periods of this random ""illness"" striking---it's lasting 2-3 days, and it's every 2-4 weeks. Right now, I have it again---body aches, headaches, cough, utter exhaustion. I've been asleep for 12 hours & need MORE. 

Quite honestly, I'm angry. I want my life back. What could be causing this? How do I fix it? What does ""exhaustion"" look like, medically? And now that I've finally beaten back so many of the demons that have plagued my family, how can I do the self-care necessary so I can enjoy it?

AskDocs,What’s wrong with me!? Mental health and gynaecological issues.,"
I am a F, 28, 58kg, 175cm, on no meds but take some supplements (vitamin d, magnesium, charcoal, cranberry, vitamin c, collagen, ashwagandha) Currently in a long distant relationship with a man, not using condoms as I am allergic. I have no children but I would like them in the future. I don’t want to get pregnancy right now as it’s not convenient (about to start my masters) so would like to go on birth control. I do have some issues that I am worried about it being made worse or in general. 

Gynaecological issues:

My menstruation varies month to month; some months I have painful cramps and little bleeding, other months I have heavier bleeding and little cramping, other months I have extremely painful cramps, fever, shivers, nausea, can’t get out of bed and heavier bleeding. PMS varies month to month also. I have had my hormones checked and have had multiple ultrasounds done. In the past my ovaries have been described as “polycystic looking” and the more recently the ultrasound technician said she thinks I could possibly have endometriosis, but if I do the growth is very mild as it’s not showing up on the ultrasound. 

My vaginal pH is unbalanced really easily. My boyfriend can’t come inside me because I will get BV. I get recurrent thrush infections which I treat with boric acid or clotrimazole if they get really bad. I also feel like my pelvic floor is very weak as my boyfriend can’t feel me when I kegel on him. (I’ve just started doing kegels to combat this) 

On top of this, I feel as if my vagina is quite dry and I have trouble orgasming. Sex can be painful as lubrication can be an issue (posterior fourchette sometimes has little tears) and my cervix stays very low (not sure why this is happening as never used to be a problem in the past, could be due to recent anxiety around sex? Sometimes even my mouth gets dry during sex). 

Mental health issues:

I am worried about my mental health being affected. I have bad anxiety and depression. Both are (sort of) stable for the first time in years and I don’t want to go into another deep psychotic depression and not be able to come out of it. As I’m currently unemployed due to corona and am living at home with people that I have very little daily contact with. 

I would like to go on the pill as I do not want to get pregnant right now and I was thinking that these issues could be hormonal and that going in birth control would help but at the same time I am worried about going on it if my mental health becoming unstable or exacerbating my gynaecological issues if I go on birth control. 

This is causing me so much stress. I don’t even know why my boyfriend is choosing to stay with me through all of this. I feel like such a burden! I would really appreciate any advice.",1,3,2020-09-10,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,Aches in legs and arms that seem to go around and proteinuria,"I’m a 36 year old female who suffered from high blood pressure during my last pregnancy 2 years ago which was thought to be preeclampsia. At my post natal check up my blood pressure was still high, and high levels of proteinuria and some blood was found in urine showing kidney disease. I am taking Enalapril since then (and currently Methyldopa). 
Nephrologist doesn’t want to do a kidney biopsy and strongly suggested IGA Nephropathy but we have to ‘wait and see’ how it goes with the proteinuria. It did seem to reduce to an acceptable level after taking Enalapril. 

In parallel, and since over a year I feel pain in my legs (shins mainly) and arms which seems to flare up every few weeks and just go around. The pain is not very strong but bothers me a lot to the point I wake up at night. There is no connection with movement, diet, etc. I haven’t exercised for years. I have some days where I feel these aches a lot and they seem to go around in my legs and arms, one second I have pain in my shin, then in my right arm, then left... this is mainly on the right side of my body which also starts to feel weak and where I have some problems with my hand, grabbing things, and feel overall weakness on that side of the body. It also happens on the left side but much less noticeable. I also feel a burning sensation around my knees and upper legs and have needle like pains in different parts of my body and muscle cramps. I have abdominal pain in RUQ in a very specific place but haven’t done a CT scan. An endoscopy came back clear. 

I did a bunch of tests: lupus (ana) negative, anca negative, Lyme disease, no Bence Jones protein, celiac disease and endoscopy for abdominal pain, MRI of upper spine, neck and brain all clear, lumbar puncture, no paraneoplastic antibodies. EMG was good. Neurologist suggested benign fasciculation syndrome. 
I made a genetic test for familial amyloidosis which was negative. Vitamins B6 and B12 within range, vitamin D low but taking supplements. Thyroid ok. I don’t normally suffer from anxiety or stress even though this is now causing some anxiety. 

My nephrologist is certain the kidney situation is not related to the other complains. I was also told there is no need to see a rheumatologist as the body aches aren’t in the joints. My family doctor mentioned fibromyalgia and in this case ‘I just need to live with it’. The pain I have doesn’t seem to be as described in fibromyalgia (in terms of pain when applying pressure or tender points). It is a little hard for me to accept the idea that every other day I have random pains going around in my body and a non identified kidney disease. 

Any ideas? Thank you!",1,1,2021-01-10,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,"Hi, I'm 32F, and I have unintentional weight loss, and docs can't figure out what's wrong.","I went to my pcp back in June when I first noticed this because I dropped down to 118lb from 125 in maybe a year — I'm not actually sure when it happened as I wasn't weighing myself. Anyway, he ran a whole bunch of tests — CBC, inflammatory markers, A1c, metabolic panel, thyroid, celiac, abdominal ultrasound, lung x-ray — all came back normal. He said it was probably stress, and to keep an eye on it and see if it happens again. And if so, he would send me to an endocrinologist because he didn't know. I do have anxiety and a lot of stress, but I've been stressed my whole life (diagnosed with OCD) and I've never lost weight before. I was also struggling with infertility and in the process of doing an IUI at the time, and was advised to go ahead and keep doing that.

So anyway, I kept an eye on it, started exercising more to help with stress. My weight actually went up a couple of pounds, so I thought the problem was done with. The IUIs didn't work, so insurance finally approved a round of IVF. I did an egg retrieval — weight still good. Then I started prepping for a transfer cycle. Around a week before my transfer, my weight suddenly started dropping again. I was on Estrace, and had just started Crinone and Progesterone in Oil, and was on several other supplements, and I thought they were responsible. Fast forward 2 weeks — I've done my transfer, and it stuck! Which is amazing after four years of infertility. However, my weight is still dropping, and I don't know what the hell is wrong. In 2-3 weeks, I've lost about 5 pounds. And this is obviously causing an insane level of stress, especially now that I'm hopefully actually pregnant.

The fertility clinic did another thyroid test and said my tsh was a bit low (.02) and they sent me to an endocrinologist, who did a full panel of thyroid tests (still waiting for those) but said that level of tsh is perfectly acceptable in pregnancy. And that if my thyroid isn't the problem, she can't help me. I'm at a complete loss at this point, as my PCP also told me to see the endo if this keeps happening (and my thyroid was all in range at the time!), and she doesn't seem to think it's my thyroid and she can't help with anything else? I literally have no idea what's wrong. I mean I'm going to wait for the results, obviously, but she doesn't seem to think my thyroid is the problem. And if it isn't, what doctor I should see then?? Should I go back to my PCP and have him send me somewhere else? I don't have any other symptoms of anything that I can think of — except according to my apple watch history, my resting heart rate has increased slightly for the same time frame as this weight loss, and I'm wondering if it's related. I did mention this to the endo, and she had no comment.

I will also note that I had a previous molar pregnancy and 8 months of chemo treatment with  methotrexate and then act-d, though I'm hoping this is not in any way related. I did not lose any weight during that time.

Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions? Anything?

History of anxiety and POTS
Non smoker 
Regular prenatal care 

OB sent me to cardiology for some follow up after I had a bad dizzy spell I attributed to POTS. Cardiology did an echo which came back completely normal. Put me on a 2 week heart monitor to be sure expecting it to come back normal. I was in sinus rhythm as expected and some sinus tach (expected—my resting heart rate during my second trimester was often between 110-130). But I had several runs of SVT and one brief run of v tach. I also had some PACs and PVCs.

As a former L&D nurse I understand just enough of this to make me stress. He thinks it is pregnancy induced and said my heart is healthy, just my body is going through a lot (I also had HG and stayed dehydrated a lot of my pregnancy—even ended up on fluids). I will repeat the tests after I deliver and he expects the problems to be resolved. 

I will follow up with OB of course, but my appointment is over a week away and I’m starting to stress. What could this do to my pregnancy? Increased risk for IUGR, pre e?! Will I need to be induced? If so, when? C section or can I deliver vaginally? What is the current recommendations for delivering patients with these types of arrhythmia?

AskDocs,"3yr old woman with ongoing hormonal related symptoms, some uncommon - PCOS or something more? Am waiting on blood test results to post","Hi there,

I am a 30-year-old woman, who has suffered from a long string of supposedly hormone-related symptoms since puberty. I have seen several endocrinologists, all who diagnosed me with PCOS, say they can't explain my more irregular symptoms but tell me not to worry about them, and send me on my way. I am wondering if there is the possibility of something more going on.  I weigh 55kg at present and am 161cm tall. I have fallen pregnant twice, but haven't gone through with the pregnancies. Apparently no hypothyroidism and no diabetes.

**My typical symptoms:**

*  irregular periods, sometimes painful (have been years without menstruating, currently getting period every two weeks)
* male pattern hirsutism (was classed as severe however I have had thousands of dollars of laser hair removal and is now somewhat reduced. Hair still returns on my upper back, face/neck, and buttocks irrespective of laser treatment)
* hormonal acne
* extreme mood swings and severe insomnia which appears to be cyclical
*  cysts on ovaries 
* issues with weight loss/management. At my highest, I have been 75kg. To lose weight, I have to reduce my calories to below 1200cal per day. 

**My less than typical symptoms:**

* severe melasma on the upper lip
* constant slight lactation from one breast for the past 6 years (have been tested for Prolactinoma and breast abnormalities both with negative results)
* hypertrophied inner labia (currently 6cm and apparently progressing)
* tubular breasts
* darkened patches of skin around the groin
* osteopenia diagnosed in my last BMD test, with subsequently elevated levels of blood calcium consistently
* moderate vitamin D deficiency

**'unrelated' medical issues:**

* Factor V Leiden deficiency
* congenital acetabular femoral impingement and have been recommended for surgery to repair a torn labrum
* Hypermobile joints and some skin hyperelasticity, not enough to diagnose as Ehlers-Danlos
* ADD for which I am medicated with dexamphetamine
* Long term issues with depression/suicidal tendencies, which I personally attribute to my health issues. 
* idiopathic urticaria
* scoliosis

**Treatment so far:**

* lifestyle changes, low carb diet, laser hair removal, etc.
* Implanon several times - discontinued
* spironolactone 100mg for hirsutism and acne for 2 years which led to elevated liver enzyme levels, edema, and dehydration issues. During this time my period stopped completely, but my doctors believed this was due to malnutrition when trying to lose weight. Discontinued
* **currently** metformin 200mg per day for the past 6 weeks - again to regulate the period and reduce hirsutism/acne. Was decided to try this instead of spironolactone. 

I have asked for a most recent blood test panel copy to post here - should be available tomorrow. The consensus seems to be: elevated prolactin is stress-related, most hormone levels are within 'normal' range, testosterone is only slightly elevated, consistently high levels of blood calcium isn't necessarily cause of concern. 

I understand PCOS causes the majority of my symptoms however the genital abnormalities, constant lactation, and melasma cause me to think that there could be something else going on. Could it be just a particularly unfortunate case of PCOS or something more? I understand there is probably not a treatment to reverse some of my symptoms, however, a definitive diagnosis beyond ""it's probably related to your PCOS"" would be of much relief to me.

Finally, I appreciate whoever has taken the time to read this post.

AskDocs,"I am pregnant and had to wean off of my adderall, how long until it's cleared from the baby's system and will be withdraw from Prozac?","31 female, white
About 200 pounds, 5'1.
Never smoker, occasional drinker but not since AI got pregnant.
Medications are: Prozac 60mg, ambien 2.5mg-5 MG as needed for sleep. Tylenol as needed, famotadine and tums as needed (but daily almost), and I've had to take vistaril 25mg for a break through anxiety attack a few weeks ago. (discontinued) Adderall regular 10mg up to 3x a day weaned off over about a month

I have a history of anxiety, adhd, severe depression, post partum depression from my last pregnancy. 

Current conditions 26 weeks pregnant (due in July) and have been on pelvic rest and light duty since late December due to bleeding and losing blood clots. OBGYN checked thoroughly and ultrasounds show health cervix, no issues, and a visual examination of my cervix and vaginal walls are intact and no tearing, so it was ruled a ""leaky blood vessel"". Amniotic fluid is great, and anatomy scan showed a very healthy, organs all in place with good blood flow, baby boy. 

Bit of back story - I found out I was pregnant in December when I was further along than I realized because I was still having a ""period"" (the spotting and bleeding I was experiencing that ultimately put me on pelvic rest a few weeks later). Okay so I have been on Prozac since before I gave birth to my second child in Nov 2016, I want to say I started it in late September because my depression was making me go a little crazy. Our home flooded in Louisiana so add that to the stress of a new baby. That baby did great, and I stayed on my low dose of Prozac for almost a year claiming things were fine but was really dealing with serious PPD. I finally stepped up and got help and since then I am now up to 60mg of Prozac daily. My insurance does not cover any name adhd medications or XR, so I have been on 10 MG Adderall up to 3x a day for about 2ish years. 

When I found out I was pregnant, I didn't want to just stop taking the Adderall so I decided it was best for me to slowly wean off. In the past if I abruptly stopped I had some really angry withdrawal symptoms, so I talked it over with my OB and Pysch and while understanding the risks, I weaned off much slower than I maybe should have. But I'm finally off of it. However after what happened during my last pregnancy I felt it was safer for me to stay on that treatment, because if I tried to do without medication again I was terrified of what I'd do to myself or my unborn baby. I had full support from both doctors. Well, the support that is tied with their cautions of course.

Okay so I stopped taking the Adderall around January/February-ish, but still on Prozac. I know both can cause the baby to withdraw once he's born. How long would the Adderall be effective in his system if I stopped taking it in January and presumably go full term to July, is there a risk he would still have any in his system to cause him to withdraw? Would the Prozac exacerbate anything or bc the Prozac is still in my system so it would be in his, would that affect how the Adderall leaves? And with the Adderall being a low dose to begin with then wean down to, does that make a difference as to whether he may withdraw at all from it? How many weeks does it take to clear their system in utero? I've seen reports that some women are going into preterm labor when they got sick so if I somehow deliver early could the Adderall still be there? 

I figure there's a chance he will withdraw from the Prozac, and I feel ashamed I still have to take it but I can't put my family through that again. My 7 year old son was terrified of me for weeks after. I just know amphetamines can be worse when it comes to withdrawing in infants so to combine the two now is really scaring me. Thank you for any help.

AskDocs,My veins are suddenly very visible all over my body,"Hi there,

I'm 25, female, non-smoker, no chance of pregnancy.

I noticed 3 nights ago that all of a sudden, my veins are EXTREMELY visible to the point of looking luminous, like very bright green and visible, under skin. In particular my upper body - my chest, shoulders, arms, down to my hands.

No other changes during this time except I just finished my period, have been stressed and anxious because of Covid, and have had bouts of nausea/headaches recently but attributed them to mental health issues and too much sun exposure.

Other maybe important information: I have been doing little to no exercise during quarantine apart from a few walks a week. And a couple years ago a doctor told me I have a low blood palette count.

Not having any pain.

No chronic health issues; don't smoke/do drugs, am pretty thin.

Does this sound serious and a reason to get checked out by a doctor?",7,3,2020-06-04,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,"8 months postpartum, unexplained weight loss","34F

5’5” Weight steady at 174lbs (pre pregnancy and up until 4-5 weeks ago). Now 163lbs.

8 months postpartum, healthy pregnancy, c-section delivery due to fetal distress. Baby on solids but continues to breastfeed 5-7 times a day.

Exercise 3-5 times a week. Dairy free diet due to baby having an intolerance, but have started to reintroduce it into my diet within the last 2 weeks. Not a lot of snacking or eating out due to pandemic.

PMhx: Depression & anxiety (well managed with therapy and 75mg sertraline OD), migraines rarely (no meds). Otherwise healthy. No known allergies.


I have lost 11 lbs in the last month unintentionally (was planning to wait until finished breastfeeding to try to lose weight). While I am happy to be heading to a healthier weight, I am concerned as I haven’t been attempting weight loss. I’ve had night sweats off and on since giving birth (currently getting them nightly) and the last couple weeks I’ve been very nauseous. I have thrown up a few times, and feel sick after eating most meals. I don’t have much of an appetite currently.

I have taken many pregnancy tests and they’ve all been negative.

I just had my first postpartum period 2 weeks ago and around that time also started slowly reintroducing dairy into my diet. Before and during my period my appetite definitely increased.

I don’t want to go to the doctor if it isn’t needed due to the current climate, but it’s always been drilled in my head that unexplained weight loss and night sweats = trouble, so I’m a little nervous.

Other than the nausea issue and night sweats I feel well. No fatigue, no other symptoms I’ve noticed.

I would love to know if this can be explained by hormones and/or diet and/or pandemic stress, or if I should see my family doctor (and if so can it wait).

Gender: Female   
Weight: 142, 64 kgs  
Body type: Athletic   
Medical conditions: Ulcerative Colitis (deep remission since 2016), Migraines with Auras (diagnosed 2013)  
Medications: Entyvio, Nortriptyline (10 mg daily), Sumatriptan, Naratriptan   


  
History of present illness: 

I have been suffering from what I believe is a migraine for four days. The pain and symptoms are not constant. 

Wednesday evening, I noted posterior neck stiffness, which is typically a precursor to my migraines. I took naratriptan, and a full migraine did not develop. During the day, I hiked six miles in warm, humid weather. I believe that I was adequately hydrated. I drank multiple Gatorades and bottles of water during and after the hike. I also brought snacks and ate before, after, and during the hike.

Thursday morning, I felt very tired when I woke up, but otherwise, I felt fine. I had two cups of tea with breakfast to wake myself up. However, throughout the day, I began to feel progressively worse. I developed weakness and nausea. My mind also felt very foggy. I noticed that looking at my phone or reading made my symptoms worse. I took my second naratriptan of the week. Symptoms remained until patient slept that night. 

Friday, I awoke and felt foggy. I drank caffeine and felt more mentally clear. I hiked eight miles in warm, humid weather but felt more fatigued than usual during the hike. In the evening, I felt nauseous and weak. I took naratriptan and went to bed early. 

Saturday, I awoke feeling foggy again. Caffeine helped again. I felt fine until exertion. Then I felt nauseous, hot, and weak. Eventually, an aura developed. I also experienced near syncope when standing. I did eat normally throughout the day. I took a sumatriptan. 

I have been taking my nortriptyline, but I missed one dose on Wednesday. 

I do notice that I often get migraines after I hike. However, I am very athletic. I used to swim 2 hours every day before COVID. Pools are closed near me so I have been running and during HIIT exercise instead. Thus, the hikes really are not too much of an exertion.  Furthermore, I have been making sure to have proper nutrition and hydration. 

There is no chance of pregnancy. I just got my period, so I know I am not pregnant. My migraines are not hormonal. I get migraines during all times of my cycle, so the fact that I just started my period is just a coincidence. 

I know that stress often triggers my migraine, but I am not too stressed at the moment. 

The nausea and the length of this migraine are atypical for me, which is why I am concerned. I have only started experiencing nausea with the migraines recently. I am due for another Entyvio infusion next week, but I do not think this is related to my UC. However, I have been experiencing constipation for the past week. 

I am unsure of what is causing the migraines, and I would like a second opinion. Should I be concerned? The nausea is really bothering me. I see my neurologist in a few weeks. This is the third neurologist I have been too, and this will be my third time seeing him. He took a scan of my head last year and said my brain looked normal. Should I try a new prescription? I have had only some success with nortriptyline. I notice that I get migraines less often and the pain is less, but I still get them, which is why I am resorting back to the triptans.

Joint pain becoming more constant in the last few months, sudden onset of aches in one knee or elbow, some swelling, no injury to areas prior. Discomfort comes in waves throughout the day.

Stiffness in hands, especially when cold. Has abated somewhat since quitting cooking professionally.

Hair is becoming very brittle and breaks easily. It was bleached and dyed over a year ago but has had no heat styling, additional chemicals etc other than shampooing and conditioning since onset of alopecia areata in August last year.

Fatigue and brain fog becoming the new normal, I almost feel disassociated most of the time. No matter how much sleep I get I'm still tired.

Vertigo occasionally over the last few weeks, very sudden onset then gone within minutes.

AskDocs,I'm 23F and worried due to delayed periods," 

I met my BF in March 1st week and we had unprotected sex several times then. He never came near or in me during that time. Still as a protective measure I took 2 contraceptive pills during that week. I got early periods during second week of March. But I haven't gotten my next periods yet.

We've been under lockdown since then due to COVID. Now my periods are getting delayed. I'm worried sick because of this. Last week, I was also diagnosed with a UTI and started taking medication for it.

What is the chance that my delayed periods are due to pregnancy? Or is it due to stress/UTI?

AskDocs,Missed Period after Laporoscopic surgery for Endometriosis,"20F, 5""4 (163cm), about 130 lbs (59 kg) 

I drink about 5 glasses of wine a week now that quarantine has started, depending on the week. 

2 months ago I had the following procedures:
- Hysteroscopy with currettage (they wanted to collect samples from my uterus)
- Not sure what it's called but they put blue dye through my fallopian tubes to check for blockage. No blockage was found
- Laporoscopy with excision of 2 endometriosis lesions on a ligament holding the uterus and in the douglas pouch.

2 months before the surgery, I stopped taking visanne (0.2mg dienogest), as instructed by the specialist. I had my regular (horrible) periods again, with my 28 day cycle. My first period after surgery was right on time and business as usual (lots of blood and pain yay).

I was having pain after surgery due to overgrowth of Ureaplasma parvum and gardnarella bacteria. My gyn (specialist post OP appointment was cancelled due to Covid) perscribed me a 7 day course of Doxycycline and Dalacin V. I finished the course about 2 weeks ago. That pretty much cleared up the issue. I am thinking this could be the cause, since this has been the only change since my previous period. 

My 2nd period after the surgery should have happened 10 days ago. But nothing happened. No PMS, no ovulation cramps, nothing.... I had mild spotting (like a couple drops/smear) about 5 days ago but nothing since then. I was worried I could be pregnant, but 3 pregnancy tests have come up negative now. My partner and I only had sex a few times since the surgery, and are relying on condoms. The last time we had sex was 3 weeks ago, so tests should be showing up positive if I was pregnant.

There hasn't been any major changes since my last period. Quarantine has been going on a while, even during my last period. No weight change. No change in stress, or routine or anything in the last couple months. Tbh i'm super happy not to have my period but I am worried what could be causing it. 

Should I be contacting my specialist ? Or my gyn ?

We waited 2 months for an appointment with a concussion specialist.  He didn't even look at the MRI, previous records, or include my .  And my son forgot to bring them up.  My son said he told him he had ""no active concussions"" and that he only sees people with ""fresh"" concussions up to 3 months.  Told my son to go see a neuropsychiatrist because his problems ""all sound emotional"". (I imagine he told him he has no interest in anything, and that he feels nothing but anger and irritated all the time.  Because on the spot, he wouldn't remember to mention the reading issues for example, because it wouldn't have just happened, so it slips his mind.    


(The following are excerpts with a few edits from a letter written to the doctor.  Sorry for any copy paste errors or extra info.  Pressed for time, and I just need some kind of guidance.  It includes history, behaviors, examples, times, history, and anything else we felt was pertinent.) Questions at end.


	On September 13, 2015, XXX sustained a concussion, with no loss of consciousness, as a back-seat passenger in a car accident where the car, at a stop, was hit from behind by a texting driver travelling around 35 mph with no braking..   He, as well as the others in the car, went on to participate in a Spartan Race, which was the destination when the accident occurred.  My spouse, who was meeting them at the race to also participate, noticed something was ""off"", there was ""something wrong"".  He was observed having difficulty with balance obstacles which was unusual for him. Also acting ""giddy"".  He was sore, but returned to work the following day.  In speaking with him and his brother by phone as the days went by, it became clear there was something wrong.  By the time I arrived there, about 10 days later, it was clear he needed help.  He was irritated, agitated, confused, and unable to follow simple directions.  As an example, we tried to play a game of “Clue” which was rated 10+ years old.  With only three people playing, every time it was his turn, he had forgotten how to play the game, even though he just was hearing me explain to his brother and that he held a card with instructions in his hand, I had to explain how to play at every turn.  He would leave the room frequently and be unable to recall what he was going to do.  Work activities he performed routinely, he was drawing a blank on how to perform.   His frustration and agitation at work was causing an issue for not only him, but his employer as well.
   
He went to his first appointment Oct 1st with his PCP, Dr. XXXX at XXXX.  She was concerned with the neck pain/whiplash, for which she referred him to physical therapy.  It was only upon our pressing concern with the above-mentioned symptoms that she off-handedly said he probably had a concussion.  Her treatment for concussion was to just rest and avoid to many electronics, without referral to any other specialist or follow up testing. 

	XXXX Physical Therapy did the intake and found he had more neurological issues, and was referred for Occupational Therapy, as well as Speech Therapy.  Both were performed at the XXXX Therapy location.  His symptoms, if I recall correctly, included halos around objects, bright colors and lights bothering him, headaches, inability to recall simple words as well as memories, errors in math calculations, spacial awareness and balance issues, among others.

	At the time, I was also involved with getting care for his brother, who also sustained a concussion in the accident.   I quickly noticed the level of care XXXX received was inferior.  I switched him to the Concussion Center at XXXXX in XX.  His first appointment for intake for the concussion was December 14, 2015, two months after his accident.  In addition to the above referenced symptoms, he also suffered from insomnia, anxiety, and depression.  His ability to make sound decisions in his best interest was further impaired and he seemed to not understand long term ramifications of his decisions. 
 
During his treatment at the Center, unfortunately, he did not always follow the providers advice.  He disliked swallowing pills, and found the medication did not work.  He was prescribed sleeping medication (melatonin, trazadone, temazepam, Ambien), none of which worked.  He did not take the multivitamin or vitamin D prescribed for more than maybe a week or two, despite providing gummy vitamins to ensure his compliance.  He did not even play the brain games suggested by his treatment provider.

	Unfortunately, within days of XXX's first appointment, his brother was terminated from his position due to his medical condition... the prospect of getting fired overrode his health and he returned to work too soon.  I also recall he hit his head on a car rather forcefully at work.  During that time, the company lost patience and did not believe concussions were “a thing”.  They demoted him, had him train his replacement, cut his hours, and bounced him within branches until he ultimately had to quit.  This stress, added to financial difficulties, his ongoing challenges with the post-concussion syndrome, the ending of a long term relationship due to the concussion symptoms, constant fatigue brought on in part by his difficulty sleeping, and my ability to influence the situation from afar when I returned to (my home state), found him leaving treatment in August 2016.  Only 8 months after his initial appointment, with a lot of symptoms unresolved.  (He was dismissed from PT.  He was also dismissed from Speech T and Occup T, and told he insurance will only cover him to a point he can return to work, not to where he was before the accident.  That he may never be back to 100% again).

I was able to have him return to treatment at (the concussion center) in Sept 2017.  His chief complaints being insomnia, depression, lack of focus/concentration, headache, and vision difficulties.  XXXX, CRNP, ordered an MRI (his first and only since the accident (The one in the link)), a neuro-psych exam, ocular therapy and a sleep study among other things.  He was able to get the MRI completed, and attended the diagnostic appointment for his vision difficulties.  The vision diagnostic testing produced results indicating a “previously unresolved concussion”.  The other recommendations fell by the wayside as he was left to follow through on his own as I was dealing with serious health issues with his younger brother and myself, and the death of his grandfather.  And at the time I believed he was in better shape mentally than hindsight has proved.

Within weeks of his MRI being completed, he was in another car accident.  He went head on into a pole after falling asleep behind the wheel.  He hit his head on the steering wheel.  However, I was unable to convince him to seek treatment.  His life spiraled out of control, lost both jobs due to worsening of symptoms and the trauma he suffered.  By this time, his support system shifted. His brother, whom he had lived with, had moved out of state and XXX made less than stellar decisions with his company, which pulled him away from healthy decisions and his family.  His personal safety and health were in jeopardy at that point and we were able to move him (out of state), where he he currently lives with his brother and friend.

The move has allowed his life to settle to a point where he has realized he is still suffering from lingering effects and the additional blow has not only caused a worsening of symptoms but has added new ones such as apathy. ...  He still suffers insomnia, irritability, memory issues, lack of focus and attention.  He now finds that when he is faced with a mundane task that does not challenge him at work, he physically becomes  tired and has difficulty keeping his eyes open and is irritated easily..  He is quick to fly off the handle and gets angry and frustrated about things he shouldn’t think twice about.  He sometimes forgets he doesn’t make the rules at work and is being paid to do the work the boss requires.  He struggles greatly now  during the slow times, when he is asked to do things outside of mechanics, like clean the garage.  He works as an Automotive Technician in a a car repair place along side of his brother.  His brother would call me, frustrated, multiple times, worried XXX was going to be fired for his behavior.  XXX, currently, feels his health is none of his employers business.  ...  It has been relayed to me on multiple occasions that the boss, try to teach XXX advanced diagnostic skills, which he has expressed a strong desire to learn, but XXX's frustration, tone, and sometimes flippant attitude, would derail the attempts.

From an outside perspective, he has limited insight into his condition.  I personally find I have to have conversations in bits and pieces or risk him getting angry.  He will get angry having any conversation he “doesn’t want to hear”, and stops the conversation, such as talking about some of his symptoms and what other people are observing.  Sometimes, simply asking him if he is going to be playing a video game later that evening is met with agitation and hostility.  People tend to walk on eggshells around him to not set him off, with the exception of his brother, whom he frequently butts heads with.  He has, to an extent, become paranoid about the motives of his family.  

He also has difficulty picking up social cues that conversations have shifted, or that a particular conversation isn’t appropriate for the setting; he doesn’t seem to “read the room”.  He continues to make decisions that are counter to his goals.  It also seems that his maturity has been stunted, which causes issues not only for the people around him, but with his employment.  

XXX also has difficulty understanding how his actions and words impact others, as well as consideration for other people in some respects.  He is disorganized and messy, and unintentionally disrespectful to family and friends.  And while he views advice and guidance from his family with suspicion, he readily believes tall tales from people he has just met, although it is painfully obvious to surrounding people, they are not what they appear to be and will cause him harm.  He has been taken in numerous times, and it seems these types of people gravitate to him and derail his life.   The last one put his life in real danger multiple times and came close to destroying everything he had painstakingly built in the previous 5 years.  He now recognizes he needs to learn how to be more selective in his company and is hoping to learn through therapy how to apply judgment, and to give significant weight to his family’s opinions, although it doesn’t match what he believes or feels about certain people and/or activities.

One of the things that came from him seeking treatment again, was the knowledge he never returned for the results of his MRI.  With the turmoil at the time, I came to believe he had received the results and was given an all clear.   This was one conversation I had hoped to have with him in person, but instead had to be done by phone two days ago. (unable to travel to him due to risk factors with the current virus) I was making sure he would address it in this initial appointment and have the results explained to him in a manner he could understand.  He got agitated and shut down the conversation upon the knowledge that the MRI may have captured some irregularities.  While I understand news like this can be shocking, I was delicate in explaining the situation and reaffirmed he may have success overcoming or mitigating some or all of the effects with adherence to treatment.  I told him I was not able to determine the severity, if any, in the MRI report, but that the frontal lobe was mentioned and that it *may* be an explanation for the difficulties he has been experiencing and others have been noticing.  Also, having such information would be a basis for forming a treatment plan to overcome the challenges he currently faces.  From conversations over the past few months, I am convinced he is committed to getting well. 
 I also was unaware he was referred to partake in a sleep study and to have a nuero-psych evaluation completed in 2016, until I saw his records just this past week.  He never relayed this information to me.  Once I was unable to attend his appointments to secure information first hand, I was left out of the loop because he would forget information provided during the appointment and quickly lose the papers given to him.  

Usually at these appointments they ask about personal and family history.  For this, I offer his was a normal pregnancy, with a planned C-section (due to previous C-sect) and he hit all his age appropriate milestones.  He experienced four events that may be of interest:
1.	Around the age of 2, he dove off a top bunk bed to land on a lower bed.  He missed the bed and split his head on a stone tile floor.  He was given stiches in the hospital for the gash, but no mention of follow up except for stiches removal. This was around 1996. (There were no obvious signs of distress in watching him afterwards I can remember)
2.	When he was four years old, he contracted an illness that manifested in painful swelling of the joints and purpura all over his body.  He was quarantined in intensive care in St Joseph’s Children’s Hospital in North Jersey.  There was disagreement among the attending physicians as to what caused it.  The three ailments suggested were meningococcal meningitis, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Henoch-Schonlein purpura.  He was given intravenous medication as treatment for meningitis at the insistence of one doctor, but released with a diagnosis of HSP by the attending physician who released him.  He continued to have fatigue and swelling in his feet if he was on his feet for a relatively short amount of time.  He had a relapse 6 months later.
3.	When 8 or 9, while playing basketball at a hoop in the street, he dove for a ball going out of bounds and hit his head off an edge of cement pipe workers had laid nearby for repair work.  He hit with such force he required two levels of stitches. (Nothing mentioned by er staff about anything to look for except follow up for stiches) 
4.	When he was 10 years old, he broke the bone in his little finger clear in half and it was set wrong in the hospital.  At a follow up appointment over 2 weeks later with a specialist, with no warning, the doctor rebroke his finger to reset it.  He didn’t speak for three days.  Without proper guidance from family or the medical professionals, as a young parent, I did not know what, if anything, to do for him.  

Both sides of his family have neurological ailments.  These include anxiety, depression, ADHD, and suspected bi-polar 1 disorder.  XXX was treated from around the age of 14 to 18 for Bi-Polar 1 disorder.  While I would whole heartedly agree he has ADHD (attention subtype, not hyperactive), anxiety and depression, the mood disorder never felt right.  Obviously, he was moody, but the “manic” episodes didn’t quite fit.  He would be fine, quickly fly off the handle, and then it would be over as quickly as it came.  It didn’t, and still doesn’t, fit what my understanding of “manic episodes” or “hypo-manic episodes” are as defined by the DSM criteria.  His anxieties surrounding his treatment at school, by both students and staff, was a large factor in his ability to fall asleep, and not a “decreased need for sleep”.  

It wasn’t until I learned the effects of post-concussion syndrome during treatment of XXX and his brother in their 20’s, that I felt I had found an explanation for what was occurring with him in his earlier years, specifically after the accident with the pipe.  This was also around the time he was hitting puberty and moving out of state to start over, which was nowhere near the smooth transition we expected for him.   We had been offered no other alternatives besides mental disorders.  Concussions, or other physical causes, were not even considered despite giving complete background information including his participation in multiple sports, including contact.  I didn’t think to mention the head injuries incurred while younger, because it was never suggested there would be any effects, short term or otherwise.  Had we been asked specifically about head injuries, the occurrences above certainly would have been provided.   As already stated, this was around the time he was going through puberty, which was originally given as the  explanation for his behavior by PCP’s who did not investigate further despite his suffering.

QUESTIONS:

What is the Non-Jargon results on the MRI?
What are lesions?  Are they open sores, or tumors, or ?
Are subcentimeters insignificant?  Or could they result in some of the issues he is experiencing?
What are ""areas of gliosis"" and ""demyelination""?
Do you have a recommendation of where to go from here, what doctors or facilities?  I am not seeing any Neuropsychologists on the insurance lookup.
Are there any specific centers or doctors that handle post concussion cases? 
Is there any test you recommend he have done that could offer more information?

AskDocs,long abdominal pain,"hi I’m 18f, 5’5, 117lbs, white
recently I’ve been having some abdominal pain that hasn’t gone away. I started having them last Friday the 27th. I thought maybe it was me ovulating, bc I normally flush out during ovulation and it was my fertile window at the time, but I rarely get related cramps. A day later however I noticed maybe it wasn’t ovulation cramps but my colon, so I took some Dulcolax in hope maybe I’m just constipated. Well it didn’t work until the following day, the 29th, yet it’s still there this morning (30th) and I can’t sleep bc it’s still painful. 
I can’t seem to determine where the pain is coming from. I feel it everywhere in the abdomen and pelvic region. I’ve been letting out gas but it’s not enough. 

Some background is that I had unprotected sex March 7th, 4 days before my period. I did end up getting my regular length period (7 days). Though due to stress I have different flows, but with some of the worst cramps ever. It’s typical for me. My bf didn’t even finish and we only did it for a couple minutes bc I thought I might pass out, so I know my possibilities of getting pregnant was low. Even then i don’t even think it’s possible to get pregnant with no ejaculation, plus an egg that’s already going through the process of shedding with the lining. I can’t go out and get a pregnancy test due to city lockdown, but idk if it’s necessary. 
Also since lockdown I’ve been missing breakfast. Probably my most important meal when school was going on, but no longer wake up for it. but food consumption has been alright, I’m not overeating and not taking in as much junk food. 

What could this pain be from? 
Ovulation? Constipation? Pregnancy? They all seem to blend together with what I’m dealing with. I truly don’t know and it’s been keeping me up for the past 4 days. 
I appreciate all advice and comments, just trying to eliminate my options here. Thank you.
I will go to the doctor soon if this doesn’t clear out btw.",1,1,2020-03-30,stress during pregnancy
AskDocs,"Vomiting 3x/day 3-4 days a week since March. Unexplained, extreme weight gain. Period breaking through birth control for weeks on end. Wth is wrong with my body?","Female, 33yo, 5'5"" & 280lbs (150lbs two years ago).

On-going conditions/Medication:
- Bipolar (abilify, 2 years)
- Anxiety (lexapro, 3 years)
- Insomnia (trazodone, 3 years)
- GERD (pantiprazole, 3 months)
- Birth control (Apri, 1.5 years total but a 6 month break in the middle)

Issues: 
- BLEEDING: Two yearsish ago, I gained 100+ lbs in a year with no diet/exercise changes, and I had a heavy period for nearly 6 months straight. I went to a Planned Parenthood because I had no insurance then and they said its probably PCOS but did not do any testing so I have no idea how concrete that diagnosis is. I started birth control and the issue stopped for some time, but now I've been lightly bleeding (through my birth control) for about five weeks.
- VOMITING: Since March, I have been vomiting 3-4 days a week, at *least* 2-3x per day. This happens shortly after eating, no matter what I eat. I was started on Rx anti-acids which seemed to help briefly and are great for my heartburn but I'm still getting sick. Its increasing rapidly, I've been vomiting 2+ times daily for a week now. 
- DIARRHEA/LOOSE BMs: at least 3-4 days per week, 4+ BMs a day. It stops if I take imodium but then I'm constipated so i really hate relying on that so heavily. Its mostly shortly after eating, no matter what I eat,

I've had an upper endoscopy done but they said everything is normal. I was just told to lose weight. I've been trying to for months with a max 5lb change. I exercise several days per week for about thirty minutes per day. I eat a balanced, veggie heavy diet with low carbs and low fat. 

I don't know what to do anymore but I refuse to accept that being sick near constantly is ""normal""!

EDIT: I should mention, I have had bloodwork and fecal exams done and they ruled out Crohns/UC, bacterial infections, and parasitic infections. My thyroid is also normal.

EDIT 2: Added my low dose birth control to medications. My tests have also ruled out pregnancy and celiac. I have no abdominal pain.",401,153,2020-10-07,birth weight
AskDocs,Why won’t you let me get my tubes tied?,"i have heard so far:

Reason: i’m too young

Problems with this:
- I’m 23 and, as long as i’m over 18, am allowed to make my own medical decisions. for instance: if i asked for a boobjob, or liposuction, or wanted a mastectomy, i would be able to get one.

Reason: i may change my mind when i’m older

Problems with this: 
- I have no interest in pregnancy. It looks painful and uncomfortable and shitty and no thanks. Nothing about pregnancy or birth appeals to me in the slightest. I fully intend on adopting children or having a surrogate.

- Pregnancy is dangerous, especially for black women. Black women are [four times more likely to experience life threanting complications in the united states during labor than white women](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/02/20/why-are-black-women-at-such-high-risk-of-dying-from-pregnancy-complications) , and [in the united states women are dying 26.4 per 100,000 people while giving birth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_mortality_in_the_United_States#Maternal_Mortality_Is_Rising_in_the_U.S._As_It_Declines_Elsewhere) . Not ONLY that, [it’s been proven that in medicine black people are often believed to simply feel less pain, for a plethora of dumb reasons, and are given less medication because of that assumption](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/how-we-fail-black-patients-pain) 

- if i do, on the off chance you are right, then i will face the consequences of that choice, when it comes. as i am an adult, and that’s how life works

Reason: i need to discuss it with my husband first

Problems with this:
- I am not married, and whether I get married or not I, as an adult, do not need permission from anyone else to make my medical decisions for me. I do not need a mans permission to get my teeth pulled, i don’t need a mans permission to get my tubes tied.

- It is stupid 

Reason: I could just take birth control

Problems with this:
- Birth control is unbearable. It. Is. TERRIBLE. WHY ARE THEY ALL TERRIBLE?! the hormones, the weight gain, the headaches, the nausea, they can make period symptoms worse, the acne, they sometimes hurt, it affects my sex drive, the way each one affects you differently and it may change from cycle to cycle and it may even change how it affects you if you use it then stop using it and then start again and it often can give you months of bleeding...no. Not even mentioning the possibly fatal side effects. 

- When men want to get vasectomies they aren’t offered birth control

So, why can’t I, an adult person of sound mind and body, who doesn’t want to get pregnant, get my tubes tied if I am willing to pay for it/my insurance will cover it?

Edit: misquoted source and more reasons birth control sucks

Edit 2: if there are any other men, or frankly any other person, who is eager to tell me how i am young and dumb and don’t know better, and about how childbirth is amazing, and how i’ll change my mind once i hold my baby or whatever, all because i don’t want to give birth, please, let me tell you now, fuck off. fuck off so hard in the face. i so, SO, don’t care about what you have to say. You can go die in a hole. ESPECIALLY if you are a man telling me how easy pregnancy and labor are because your WiFe dId iT...are you kidding?? stop.

Edit 3: I do not want to wait 10 years or see how i feel when i get married. i have no interest in my fertility, and if my husband does not agree i will not be marrying him. as a woman it is not my job to give anyone a baby. there are thousands, literally thousands, of children, specifically black children, in orphanages and foster homes who need families. If i decide to have kids, and that is a LARGE HEAVY IF, i will adopt or have a surrogate if for some reason despite my families medical history and my own neurodiverisity i decide to say fuck all that and have biological children. No one is trying to convince me of this, in fact i’m more often being tried to convince to change my mind and be pregnant. NOOOOOOOOO. no. thank you.",2323,757,2020-07-27,birth weight

AskDocs,Infant with multiple medical conditions and CPS involvement.,"This case involves my daughter and granddaughter. This case is very complicated, so this will be an extensive post.  

We found out that granddaughter had bilateral clubfoot during my daughters 2nd trimester scans.  Within the next week we went to OU Children’s hospital for additional scans and consultation with a pediatric orthopedic surgeon to get the diagnosis confirmed.  Which it was.  We immediately went into research mode and started gathering as much information as possible, and we joined a support group.  We started putting together a treatment plan with recommendations from our support group as well as information from the our Dr’s.  

Now, this is where everything gets complicated.  My daughters OB called a couple of weeks later with some upsetting news.  My daughter is Rh negative, which the OB knew about and this was her 2nd pregnancy, also something she knew, but she had failed to give her the rohgam shot, so she became sensitized.  This condition obviously took precedence.  We had to go weekly appointments to make sure baby wasn’t developing hydrops, which thankfully she did not.  However, when she was born she developed hemolytic disease/hemolysis hyperbilirubinemia and she was admitted into the NICU for 3 weeks and had 5 blood transfusions.  Her highest billi level was 23, but they held off on doing the blood tranfer/exchange because of the significant risk of brain damage that occurs with that procedure.  However, we were informed of the damage already caused by her high billi levels as well as the damaged caused by the RH disease.  This list included Cerebral Palsy.  Of course this realization that there were going to be some cognitive and/or developmental disabilities was devastating news for all of us, but we did what we do and went into research mode.  

Back to the clubfoot.  Normally babies with clubfoot are evaluated and treated within the first few days of birth, but that wasn’t an option for us.  She didn’t get her first evaluation until she was 6 weeks old.  She was referred to Scottish Rite in Frisco TX.  We took her there for her first 6 castings.  We decided to seek a second opinion when the Dr wanted to do the tendonectomy  and we just didn’t think her feet looked right.  When then went to Shriners in Shreveport.  One Dr at Shriners examined her feet and agreed that she was not ready for the tendonectomy and she needed more casting.  Another Dr also evaluated her and wanted a neurological referral because she thought that her clubfoot could be cause by a neurological condition.  So, the first Dr said that he suggested that we continue casting until we went to the neurologist, so we complied and she got 4 more casts with them.  After the last casting, which was Dec 28, she started having uncontrolled spasms and stiffness in her joints and muscles.  This cause her casts to slip so far that you could no longer see her toes, since it was a holiday weekend and they were closed, we were told to soak the casts off in the tub.  This was her last set of casts.  

In the next few weeks her spasms and stiffness were becoming more worrisome so went back to the children’s hospital for an MRI to rule out seizures or brain malformation that could be causing these issues.  While they said her brain was “clear” they did find a cyst at the base of her spine, but they just said we need to keep an eye on it.  They gave a diagnosis of hypertonic dystonia and we made an appointment to follow up with neurology.  With this diagnosis we were concerned with casting causing more harm than good, so we asked if delaying casting until we could figure out how to control her spasms was a good idea and the hospital pediatrician agreed that would be prudent.  We contacted Shriners to let them know that we would be delaying her casting and the nurse my daughter spoke with seemed to be in agreement.

She also has GI issues and vomits constantly, however they did rule out reflux and sandifers syndrome, but told us to follow up with a gastro specialist, which we are.  This brings us to February when the baby started spiting up blood in her vomit, so we took her to the local podunk ER, and they told us not to worry because they thought it was just burst capillaries from excessive vomiting.  The next day she started gushing blood from her mouth and was air flighted to the children’s hospital.  This is where shit starts to hit the fan.  The bleeding had stopped by the time they had arrived and her mouth and lips were swollen.  They got a CAT scan to rule out a GI bleed, which they did.  However, during this scan they noticed something odd in her femur, so they did some more X-rays of just her upper legs and knees.  They found what appeared to be healed fractures in both of her femurs, but there was no definite fracture line, and what appeared to be buckle fractures in both knees.  This, of course, got CPS involved.  The blood from her mouth turned out to be a clump of blood vessels under her tongue that had burst.  She did have a tongue tie and lip tie clipped before she went to the NICU and they think it may have had something to do with that.  The fractures were a mystery, but we thought that maybe improper casting could have something to do with it.  She had a follow up with radiology at the children’s hospital where X-rays were taken.  Then about a week later we went back to Shriners to get an evaluation and more X-rays. During this visit we asked for X-rays of her lower legs as well because one of them seemed to be bothering her.  They found that she had a fracture in one of her tibias.  Since she had not had casting in two months we didn’t think that what was causing this fracture, but they said they we needed to test for metabolic bone disorders and osteogenesis imperfecta.  We have an appointment for genetic testing in July.  But we remembered that when she got her X-rays done at the children’s hospital the tech took the leg with the fracture and pulled really hard to straighten out her foot and pushed it between two blocks for the X-ray.  We had to tell the tech that she had clubfoot and couldn’t be straightened out.  Of course the baby was upset the whole time, but after she did that she began screaming and was inconsolable.  But there were no X-rays of her lower legs before she did this, so we don’t have anything to compare.  We mentioned this to the dr at Shriners and the pediatrician, but they both discounted this and said that they were sure that she knew how to do her job.  

After CPS became involved it seemed as if the care dramatically changed, how we were treated not only by the hospital, but also by our pediatrician.  They also started to focus on her growth and weight and diagnosed her with failure to thrive because she is in the 1st percentile.  However, this was never an issue or brought up by the pediatrician before CPS got involved.  She looks healthy and chubby, just very small.  She does have feeding issues which is why we are seeing a specialist.  Now we have weekly weigh ins to make sure she’s gaining weight, which she is.  She’s been gaining around 3-4 ounces a week, however her length hasn’t  changed much since she was born. 

On to the CPS investigation.  There was absolutely no evidence to support abuse, so they changed their investigation to medical neglect.  We found this ridiculous with as many appointments as we go to on a weekly basis, how could we possibly be neglecting this child’s medical needs?  Not only does she see her pediatrician weekly, but she also goes to physical therapy weekly.  We have specialist appointments set, but they are several months out because that’s just par for the course.  After several, extremely tense, conference calls with CPS investigators they substantiated the medical neglect claim based on the opinion of the DHS nurse.  When asked what constituted medical neglect for this case was 1.  She had switched PCP’s too often.  Which we gave valid reasons for each. 2. She was not getting her clubfoot treatment. (We had decided to delay, but we were still planning on treatment) 3. We failed to take her to a follow up appointment. (Only because the Dr had not sent a referral). 4. We failed to pick up medication after her hospitalization. Not only had she be given her dose for that day at the hospital, it was a compound that needed refrigeration and we had a 4 1/2 hour drive home, so we picked it up the following day at our local pharmacy.  5. She wasn’t confidant we knew how to mix formula properly.  She’s a breast fed baby, but since the drs wanted her to gain weight we were giving her 2oz of formula every 2 hours for extra calories.  There was some confusion with how we were mixing because the pediatrician relayed information wrong to the nurse.  But that was her made her decision it was medical neglect.  None of the investigators agreed with her decision, but the supervisor said that since she was the only medical professional he defaulted to her decision.  We have told by the social workers that we need to appeal.  

On to today, we had our weekly appointment with the pediatrician, which has very tense since the CPS investigation.  Both of the children were there because we have been very sick the past few weeks and my grandson started throwing up this morning and we wanted him seen at the same time, so we rescheduled for an afternoon appointment because she only sees sick patients in the afternoon. Right off the bat she comes in and starts ranting about how she’s frustrated with us because we haven’t taken the baby back to get casted and that we’re not taking care of her needs and how she feels like we’re DR shopping and we reiterated that she’s had 10 castings, so it’s not like we’ve been neglecting her feet.  She tells us that she doesn’t have those records so she can’t be sure we’ve done those castings.  We said well you should have them because we signed a waiver for you to get them, so you should have them.  She said it was our responsibility to get those records for her.  Then she tells us that she got the records from my daughters OB, which are pursing a lawsuit against, and she did not give her permission to get those records.  So how could she records from a dr that we did not give permission for, but not have the we did.  Things got heated and we called the social worker in to mediate.  She changed her demeanor when the social worker was there, but she was giving her inaccurate information and every time we would rebuff what she said, she said we were being argumentative and basically saying we were acting like know it all’s because we were questioning her and correcting wrong information.  There were several times she flat out lied to her.  We’ve been sick and she has treated the kids for it, giving them antibiotics, so we couldn’t go back to Shriners because they would turn us away if any of us had a temp.  But she lied to the social worker and said they don’t screen before appointments. We have also made plans to see Dr. Dobbs in Florida because he’s the leading expert for clubfoot in the states, and comes highly recommended by people in our support group.  She does not like this at all and contends he’s a quack because he doesn’t accept Medicaid.  So, now she has convinced the social worker that if we don’t get her casting right away we are neglecting her feet and causing more problems for her.  We can’t get out to Florida until the end of May because we have appointments for specialists between now and then.  But the pediatrician is adamant that we get her casted at Shriners.  We were at that appointment for 3 1/2 hours, yet she never examined the sick child or even asked about his well being.  

We are at a loss.  Our entire life is wrapped around getting baby adequate medical attention, but it just seems like we’re being persecuted from every angle. I’m sorry it was such a loooooong post, but I’m just trying to give all of the info I can.  I also feel like the records don’t do this case justice either, because they’re either too vague, incorrect or simply inaccurate, but every time I question the records I get blow back.  Please, please, please someone help us navigate this complicated road.  We’re drowning here.",647,88,2021-04-15,birth weight

Medication: Birth Control for Endo but that's not related. Plus a lot of advil (6 maybe four times a day)

height: 5'6

weight: 150

I'm 15 and I have *extreme* pain every day in my joints. They partly or fully dislocate on a daily bases, I can dislocate my fingers without even noticing for a few hours, and my bones 'pop' contently. My ribs 'slip' out of place and make it hard for me to breath, my ankle will come out partially when I flex my foot wrong, I end up sobbing in pain after walking on hardwoods. You get the idea, I'm a mess.

But no doctor will listen to me.

I even pulled my shoulder out, far enough to see the top of the bone, for a intern (they where short on doctors so intern) and they told me it was growing pains.

I had another doctor who saw me because I was screaming in pain earlier from a hip dislocation (it hadn't happened as much back then, so I had bigger reactions) but because I had put it in at home, she told me it was 'most likely my period or something' and I got sent away.

My aunt has EDS (genetically diagnosed and everything) but my doctors won't even consider sending me in for testing. It's just so incredible frustrating that I can't be taken seriously when I spend to many nights sobbing in pain. My parents believe me, but they can't do much.

I spend almost every night sobbing in pain from this. My doctors keep telling me it's normal, but no one I ever talk so has had this much pain. I know I have at least a okay pain tolerance, because I have played full sports games with broken bones (my jaw when I was 12)

so I really want to know if there is any language or something that I should be using to get a better response? I need someone to validate this pain I am always in, even if they can't do anything. thank you!

I do have a geniral PD but they have brushed me off, so I was pursuing more specilist doctors. And *yes* I am weening off advil, sorry for scaring everyone with that.

History of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type III along with a number of comorbidities, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal issues. More details on medical history at end of post.

There has been a smell coming from my pantry for the last several days that I haven’t been able to identify. Today, I opened the door and just got hit with this wall of fumes, and I decided enough was enough. I spent about half an hour tearing it apart and smelling every single thing in it. By the time I identified the potatoes and threw them out, I was feeling pretty terrible. My head kills, I’m super nauseous, and I’m having chest pains.

I looked it up online and read that rotten potato fumes can be extremely toxic, but it’s hard to tell if I’m feeling awful because of toxins or because the smell and activity triggered flares of my pre-existing conditions (see below). It’s not uncommon for me to experience chest pains just from walking around the kitchen for a while, and I have a headache and nausea for the better part of most days as it is. It feels worse than normal, but not so much worse that it couldn’t be a heightened version of the regular stuff.

That being said, I have been experiencing some other unexplained symptoms over the last few weeks that I wonder might have been caused by inhaling the fumes before they were as noticeable. I’ve been experiencing random spikes in temperature (99.6-100) that last for about 12-18 hours, go away, and then pop back up again a few days later. I’ve also lost weight (from 122 to 111 in less than a month) with no changes in diet, and I’ve had pretty bad diarrhea and abdominal pain too (mostly upper right, but it kinda moves around). I’ve also had really bad dry eyes and dry mouth. (My rheumatologist has suspected Sjogren’s for a while and ordered a lip biopsy recently, so that’s happening soon.) I also have had a sore throat (kinda burns, probably related to dry mouth) and swollen glands.

I have an unrelated diagnostic laparoscopy scheduled for next month, and they’re going to test me for covid before that. I don’t think I have covid, and neither does my doctor. Mostly because the fever has been so off-and-on, and I’ve had no cough at all. But I’ll be tested in the next few weeks regardless.

I just don’t know how to tell whether the worsened symptoms I’m experiencing should be worrying me or not. I sent a message to my doctor, but the office doesn’t open for several hours, and she probably won’t see my message until the end of the work day anyway (that’s the time of day she usually sends me messages). If there’s a chance I’m experiencing poisoning, what steps should I take to manage it until I hear from my doctor?

Health issues: EDS (type III), POTS, mitral valve prolapse, MCAS, pernicious anemia, gastroparesis, IBD, GERD, interstitial cystitis, idiopathic hypersomnolence, small fiber neuropathy, cervical instability, scoliosis, kyphosis, tortuous colon, vestibular adenitis (two past surgeries for this), and unexplained eosinophilia (pending hematology referral). Suspected esophageal dysmotility (doctor wanted to do a manometry, but I declined because it sounds awful, so this is unconfirmed). Suspected endometriosis (pending laparoscopy). Suspected Sjogren’s (pending lip biopsy).

Meds:

I am desperate for any advice or answers to what’s happening with me; I am sorry for the long read.

I put a post on here previously asking advice about my condition, and I got loads of helpful replies- well since January I have lost an alarming 42lbs, I am getting new pains which have started in my upper back, my shoulders, under my ribs in my ?lungs, also pain when I breathe in, also important for this, I had a seizure last month whilst I was out with my friend, I had 2 glasses of wine and went into a seizure and was unresponsive for a few hours in the hospital, they said my blood results were very bad but didn’t explain how, said I could have been extremely ?intoxicated, another doctor said it could have been a ?hypo seizure, but I’m not diabetic, I was also vomiting coffee grounds whilst I was unconscious.
My condition has worsened to the point where whatever I am eating whether it’s plain food or not I am vomiting up with reflux, I only eat every 2/3 days as I feel I’m developing PTSD from eating, I’m physically scared of the pain and vomiting.. I am getting so low and depressed from what’s going on I’ve thought about suicide.

I had an endoscopy(without the camera) down to test how strong my oesophagus was, I had a barium swallow aswell which both showed up perfect, But I also had an oesophageal pH monitoring test done which is to be kept in for 24hours and you get given a diary and a monitor you’re attached too, which you can record your symptoms in e.g whenever you feel pain, whenever you eat, whenever you lay down and sleep etc; I ended up becoming severely ill when I had this in and had to rip it out after 17 hours as I was projectile vomiting everywhere and in absolute agony.
I had my results back from this test which showed I *DO* have some reflux, but I wasn’t experiencing reflux when I was vomiting, or the pain I was recording wasn’t showing as reflux either..? My doctor has said to me that because of this, if I was to be referred to the surgeons they could reject me as it’s not solid evidence of this being reflux and being treatable from surgery which I’m so upset about...
My doctor has now referred me for another endoscopy camera to go down with biopsy’s (I had an endoscopy 6 years ago which showed nothing) to hope they can see evidence of what’s going on.. but this won’t happen for a while now because they’ve stopped all surgeries and endoscopys during COVID unless it’s an emergency, and there’s a long waiting list... the doctor said to me I would have to become severely underweight or unwell in order for me to become an emergency...

I am beginning to lose the will to live, every day life is a struggle, I have started to vomit red blood, sometimes coffee grounds but not in large quantities, I have headaches, I’m in agony every day now, I am losing 1-2 pound per day depending.

My symptoms start as Sulphur burps, then I get upper abdomen pain, then chest pain going into my back and shoulders, then I will get gassy, frequent loose stool, which I will be rolling around screaming and crying from the pain and projectile vomit everywhere; and the smell of my vomit is more extreme than normal vomit, boyfriend describes it as battery acid with rotten eggs. Have been admitted to hospital multiple times when this happens, and every time I have hypertension.

I’m desperate for answers, please if anyone has any solutions or maybe answers to what’s going on with me? Any tests that I could ask to have? Or any knowledge of what could be happening with me or conditions, it would help so much, me and my family are worried sick and feel I’m slipping through the cracks.

AskDocs,"Please... It's been 2 months, several doctors and nobody can figure out what's wrong. I'm beside myself! Bright red and black blood in stools, weight loss, fevers, night sweats, exhaustion, hot flashes, loss of color in toes, and more.","**Information:**

**Issues: (multiple symptoms)**

Since around February this year, I've been having trouble with my health. It started with my nipples hurting almost daily. I figured my skin was dry and began to moisturize every day. But the pain continued.

Then, my feet and toes began to turn white and lose their feeling. I thought it was strange and just some weird one-time thing. But it continued to progress.

I soon had the chance to look at my nipples during one of the ""episodes"" and found that they, too, were white.

My doctor said it was simply Raynaud's, but booked me for bloodwork to check for Lupus just in case.

Then, Covid hit, and I wasn't able to get my bloodwork done as our small town lab basically shutdown.

Around this time, I started getting night sweats. I didn't matter what the temperature was, what I wore to bed, or what layers I discarded. I would wake up cold, damp, and sweaty at least once a week. I mentioned it to my family doctor and she booked me in to see an internal medicine specialist.

Upon seeing him, he informed me that I had almost no pulse in my legs, ankles, and feet, and ordered an ultrasound for my lower body (ABI test). He also said that my pictures and descriptions didn't match Raynaud's. He also discovered a mass in my right axilla and ordered an ultrasound for that, too.

Before I could get in for my appointments, I started noticing bright red blood in my stools. It was very small amounts that did not color the toilet bowl but were *in* the stool, not just on the outside. I also would have ""leaks"" of stool in my underwear as well as accidents.

I also lost two clothing sizes of my weight. I don't weigh myself on a scale, so I don't know how many pounds, but all of my clothes are too big, now.

Then, I started running a low-grade fever (100 F). The fever persisted for 6 days, and, with Covid being a thing, I was required to get tested and isolated. I also began to have black bloody stools, instead of just red.

My Covid test was negative.

With the fever and bleeding as a combo, my doctor had me go to the hospital while ordering an urgent colonoscopy.

They did bloodwork at the hospital. There was no sign of infection. My ANA came back positive, but my doctor ruled out Lupus saying that it was a false positive.

My platelets were high and my iron was low, so the doctor put me on iron pills.

At this time, I had also lost my appetite, only being able to stomach about half a meal a day. I've also been exhausted with very simple things tiring me out (walking across a store, repotting a plant, doing a set of stairs, etc.).

Once the fever broke, however, I regained a little bit of my appetite and energy.

I had both ultrasounds and they were both clean.

I then had my colonoscopy. They found evidence of some *something*, querying proctitis. This was done last Friday. Since then, I spiked another lowgrade fever. It's been consistently around100 F. I've lost my appetite again as well, and have had black bloody stools for a week until yesterday when I had blood-free diarrhea.

I've also developed a new rash (?) that comes and goes at random. It looks like purple or red netting on my knees, calves, and/or thighs.

My face also seems to flush at random, either going splotchy or uniformly red, and I also have regular hot flashes.

**Symptoms summary:**

\- recurring fever with no indication of infection in my blood work

\- night sweats

\- stool ""leaks"" and accidents

\- red streaks of blood in my stool as well as black stools with what looks like grains of dirt in them

\- hot flashes

\- weight loss of two clothing sizes

\- loss of appetite that comes and goes

\- exhaustion

\- pale toes and nipples (especially when it's cold)

\- hands and feet that feel cold to the touch and can't be warmed with a heated blanket

\- purple weblike rash on thighs, calves, and knees that comes and goes

\- facial flushing

\- (EDIT) forgot to add that mucus comes out when I poop. It ranges from rust-colored, bright red, to recently yellow. It tends to be in strings around my stool. 

**Not related(?):**

I've also had repeated episodes of tingling in my fingers, hands, and forearms but attributed it to anxiety (despite the fact that it happens when I'm calmly resting). My fingernails have also nearly stopped growing and my thumbnails seem to have a dent or bump in them both.

**Tests that have been done:**\- CBC (and urinalysis) which showed only low iron and high platelets and both of these seem to have returned to normal since I started taking the iron pills.

\- ABI ultrasound on both legs and right axilla ultrasound. Both were clean.

\- Colonoscopy which showed abnormalities in my rectum with a suspected diagnosis of proctitis. No hemorrhoids were found.

\- Rectal biopsy which ruled out proctitis.

**Pictures:**

Here's some pictures. I'm sorry in advance for the poor quality. My phone doesn't like to pick up red for some reason.

**Planned tests:**

The doc who did my colonoscopy is going to order a small bowel ultrasound, but I'm wondering if there's other tests worth pursuing? I see my family doc on Monday and can make suggestions then.

In the meantime, I'm losing my mind! I can't keep living like this, getting sicker and sicker. I keep having to call into work. This illness is ruining my life!!

**Medication list + additional information:**

(apologies, I don't have dosages at the moment)

\- birth control

\- Cymbalta

\- iron pills

\- Ritalin

\- pantoprazole

Initially, my family doctor figured it was my Ritalin that was making me sick, so she took me off it, switched to a few other meds, and lowered and increased the dosage. My ADHD meds don't seem to affect my symptoms at all.

The black stools are also not from my iron pills, either. That was my initial thought, but the black stools come and go and don't seem to align with the timing of my iron pills at all (I have bloody stools when I'm off them, have clean stools when I'm on them, and everything in between).

AskDocs,6 weeks pregnant and discrepancies between the gestational age of the yolk sac and the gestational sac.,"Hello, according to my LMP I'm 6 weeks and 1 day pregnant. The tech at my doctor's office performed a transvaginal ultrasound and did detect the yolk sac but no fetal pole. Also I noticed that the gestational sac is measuring 6 weeks 3 days and the yolk sac is only measuring 5 weeks 6 days which would create a 4 day gap. My HGC levels are currently at 28,555 and I go back on Thursday to see if they are doubling. I'm just wondering if this seems completely abnormal. I just had an anembryotic pregnancy that I miscarried back in December followed by a chemical pregnancy the cycle before this current pregnancy.

As title states, I went in for my first ultrasound today. It was to see if the Mirena IUD had dislodged, but the tech said it wasn’t there. Must have expelled it.  
  
However, she spent a lot of time imaging my right side with a transvaginal wand. When she finished, she asked me to stay put. She came back after about 15 minutes; said told me she had to have the radiologist read it immediately. She said the radiologist said I could go home, but call my doctor ASAP in the morning.  
  
What would be *possible* reasons for this? I understand it would all be speculative for my circumstance, but there must be some emergencies that require an immediate read but not immediate care. Can anyone detail what those could be? My mind is stuck on ectopic and some kind of mass/cancer.

AskDocs,What happened to my [29F] pregnancy?,"Female, age 29

Height: 5'9""

Weight: 133

Race: White

Medical issues: Sjogren's syndrome, linear scleroderma, anxiety, chronic migraine.

Medications taken: Imitrex and klonopin as needed for migraine and anxiety respectively.

Last year, I became pregnant on the third cycle trying. On my first scan at 7w2d, the tech was silent. I immediately knew something was wrong. The doctor came in and told me that there was no visible fetus or sac, but that there was some kind of large protrusion in my uterus. Told me it's unlikely a viable pregnancy but that the protrusion could be blocking their view, so reserved judgment.

I had two more ultrasounds following that, one at 7w6d and another at 8w4d. Still no visible fetus or sac, but the ""protrusion"" had continued to grow. My doctor was mystified. The team of radiologists at the office was mystified. Even more puzzling, my betas continued to rise. They reached 25,000 by the time my doctor said at 8w4d that we ought to do a D&C because the pregnancy was clearly nonviable. D&C occurred at 9w and we tracked my betas down to 0 over the next month.

The medical team told me they had never seen anything like it. Not what you want to hear as the patient. 

Ideas they tossed around at the time:

Chorionic bump

Molar pregnancy

Fibroid/polyp

SCH

All of the above were ultimately dismissed as possible reasons, but there was no ultimate conclusion as to what could have happened. They were puzzled over the fact that there was no vascular flow to the growth, and yet it continued to get larger with each passing scan. Equally puzzling were the rising betas.

The final notes from the last scan:

**Gestational Sac and Subchorionic layer: Protruding into the uterine cavity is an ovoid lobular echogenic lesion measuring 20 x 9 mm increased in size, previously measuring 12 x 5 mm when remeasured on the prior exam. There is no vascular flow within this lesion.**

**IMPRESSION:**

**There is no evidence to suggest intrauterine pregnancy on today's examination.**

**There is a lobular hyperechoic focus seen protruding into the endometrial cavity which appears slightly increased in size. There is no vascular flow within it. The lesion is as hyperechoic as it was on the prior exam. The differential diagnosis would include an area of blood products. Although it is unusual for hemorrhage, in that it is slightly increased in size and not become more hypoechoic. An endometrial polyp could have a similar appearance, however, I would expect vascular flow. A molar pregnancy is also in the differential given the increase in size since the prior exam. Visually does not appear to be molar. Recommend follow-up serial quantitative beta-hCG labs and follow-up ultrasound if felt clinically necessary.**

Notes from the D&C: 

**Uterine contents: Products of conception with degenerated chorionic villi.**

**The specimen is submitted in formalin labeled products of conception and consists of multiple fragments of tan to red-brown soft tissue measuring 3 x 3 x 2 cm in aggregate.  No fetal parts are identified grossly.** 

This was all so incredibly traumatizing. Now, it's been a year to the day since that D&C. We haven't missed a cycle trying and have had no success since. I'm afraid that whatever happened a year ago is also preventing me from conceiving again. Mind you, I've had the full infertility workup at this point with nothing shown to be an issue. Now I'm awaiting reproductive immunology bloodwork results. Has anyone ever seen anything like this? It's the most unusual miscarriage story I've ever seen and I hate that it's mine. I've had so little luck finding anything that might shed light on what happened and, more importantly, how it might be impacting my current lack of success.

I did NOT have morning sickness earlier in my pregnancy this is new. I assumed it was maybe acid reflux so last night I took a Pepcid, however today I now have extremely liquidy diarrhea.

AskDocs,Anyone know how to read a placenta pathology report?,"This is a weird question but I had to be induced at 37 weeks exactly, somewhat urgently, after an ultrasound (which I got due to measuring as mild IUGR) showed an issue with the umbilical cord. My baby was born small for his gestational age (5.5lbs). A nurse said he was more like a 35 week preemie in size and development and because of that wasn’t able to latch on and breastfeed. But after I switched to pumping/formula he quickly caught up and now is a perfectly healthy 80th percentile(!) 6 month old.

But I never really got an explanation of what caused the issue. I had no health issues  while pregnant aside from borderline low iron levels (that got better when I took extra supplements). 

I also for some reason gained the bare minimum amount of weight (I started at less than one pound overweight and the recommendation for an overweight mother is to gain 15-25lbs, so I probably should have gained closer to the 25 but I gained 15lbs exactly) though I didn’t have horrible morning sickness or anything and ate whatever I felt like.

Anyway idk if anyone will read this or can help me, but the main thing is that I want to know if this IUGR situation was a random occurrence or something likely to happen again if I have another baby.

I have a copy of a pathology report they did on the placenta, and the way I understand this with no actual medical knowledge is that a bit of the amnion grew over the end of the umbilical cord and compressed it a little bit. Is that actually what this means? My water didn’t break until the baby’s head and shoulders were out and he was partially in the doctor’s hands, and the doctor mentioned it because she thought he was going to be born en caul which would have been really cool 😆. So maybe the amnion was, like, extra strong? Is that a thing? If so, is it usually random? Here’s a portion of what the report says:


Abnormal cords (tethered cord in this case) are less efficient
conduits for fetoplacental perfusion, and can potentially
compromise fetoplacental blood flow.

The pink-white umbilical cord inserts 7.5 cm from the nearest
margin. The cord measures 49.5 cm in length with an average
diameter of 1.4 cm. The cord surface is smooth. There appears 
to
have been a web of amnion extending up the cord from its insertion.
The amnion has been torn and has partially pulled away a portion of
the cord surface. There are 2 shallow twists. Cut sections show 3

AskDocs,NEJM Covid-19 Vaccination - Pregnancy Case Study. Are there more studies??,"
Please see my outline and correct me if I am interpreting this information incorrectly....Just trying to better understand.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2104983



Participants ages 18-54 years of age, at 12 weeks gestation or more. 

This is a very large age gap.  Clearly there were various factors involved, such as fertility assistance for those older participants. (More on this below) 
Shouldn't these participants be categorized by relevant clinical factors in order to properfly assess the risk vs benefit? 

""Among 827 participants who had a completed pregnancy, the pregnancy resulted in a live birth in 712 (86.1%), in a spontaneous abortion in 104 (12.6%), in stillbirth in 1 (0.1%), and in other outcomes (induced abortion and ectopic pregnancy) in 10 (1.2%).""




104 Spontanious abortions occurred during the study (12.6% of participants)

On average, 2-4% of completed pregnancies end in SA before 13 weeks gestation and <1% end in SA after 13 weeks gestation.
12.6% SA rate for participants 12 weeksG+ seems like an alarming number … Is there something i'm missing? 

""A total of 96 of 104 spontaneous abortions (92.3%) occurred before 13 weeks of gestation. No denominator was available to calculate a risk estimate for spontaneous abortions, because at the time of this report, follow-up through 20 weeks was not yet available for 905 of the 1224 participants vaccinated within 30 days before the first day of the last menstrual period or in the first trimester. Furthermore, any risk estimate would need to account for gestational week–specific risk of spontaneous abortion.""





Of the 724 live born infants there were 12 sets of multiples.  

They account for roughly 3.3% of the live births in this study - Which aligns with the chances of conceiving multiples during fertility treatment. Naturally, the odds of having twins is about 1 in 250. 
Leading me to believe some participants were seeing fertility specialists, meaning they had access to premium Healthcare. (My skepticism is also backed by the fact 94% of participants were healthcare personel.)
It is more than likely these births make up the premature / underweight stats, correct?

""Data on pregnancy loss are based on 827 participants in the v-safe pregnancy registry who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [Pfizer–BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, and who reported a completed pregnancy. A total of 700 participants (84.6%) received their first eligible dose in the third trimester. Data on neonatal outcomes are based on 724 live-born infants, including 12 sets of multiples.""

""The registry enrolled 3958 participants with vaccination from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, of whom 3719 (94.0%) identified as health care personnel.""





Results not matched with relevant information collected throughout the study.

12.6% SA is very high, how can risk be accurately assessed without cross referencing data? 
Why was so much data listed on the symptom report charts, but not applied to the reported outcome chart?

""The populations from which these rates are derived are not matched to the current study population for age, race and ethnic group, or other demographic and clinical factors.""





Major Congenial Anomalies seen in 3% of live births. 

Shouldn't the major congenial anomalies be listed in the case study? Also, why were they not reported to VAERS?

""Values include only major congenital anomalies in accordance with the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program 6-Digit Code Defect List (www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/macdp.html. opens in new tab); all pregnancies with major congenital anomalies were exposed to Covid-19 vaccines only in the third trimester of pregnancy (i.e., well after the period of organogenesis).""

""No congenital anomalies were reported to the VAERS, a requirement under the EUAs.""


""Who reported pregnancy-related adverse events were spontaneous abortion (46 cases; 37 in the first trimester, 2 in the second trimester, and 7 in which the trimester was unknown or not reported), followed by stillbirth, premature rupture of membranes, and vaginal bleeding, with 3 reports for each.

AskDocs,Fact-checking Florida's new anti-abortion bill,"The text of FL HB167 states the following:

""WHEREAS, a fetal heartbeat is a key medical predictor that  an unborn child will reach live birth, and
WHEREAS, cardiac activity begins at a biologically identifiable moment in time, normally when the fetal heart is formed in the gestational sac...""

Furthermore, it offers these definitions as the basis of the law:

""Fetal heartbeat"" means cardiac activity or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart within the gestational sac.

""Gestation"" means the development of a human embryo or an unborn child fetus between fertilization and birth.

""Gestational age"" means the amount of time that has elapsed from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period.

""Gestational sac"" means the structure that comprises the extraembryonic membranes that envelop the unborn child and that is typically visible by ultrasound after the fourth week of pregnancy.

AskDocs,Does 1 miscarriage make you a high-risk pregnancy?,"30F, no smoking, drinking, caucasian, 5'1'', 125lbs.

I have had 2 normal pregnancies, and 1 miscarriage (order: live-birth, miscarriage, live-birth).  The miscarriage was at 12 weeks gestation, my husband and I decided to get genetic testing on the remains just for our own sake, it was triploid fetus, no issues with the miscarriage--OB speculates that due to the symptoms I'd had during that pregnancy, it was a diandric triploidy.  We had a D&C because of the age of the pregnancy (OB didn't give us another choice), no issues.  No issues conceiving.  Live children were born at 41w and 39w, uneventful pregnancies with both.  2nd was born SGA, but we were told by pediatricians that they are confident it was a case of constitutionally small infant (other baby as 11th percentile, and both children have been always below 12th percentile but growing at normal rates).  Even though she was SGA (and IUGR at the time, declared IUGR at 36 weeks, 10/10 BPP), she didn't decel in labor, nothing.  Both were born vaginally, 2nd degree tears, no issues in labor, short labors (2hrs 5 min, 3 hrs 41 min active labor; 2nd stage 5 mins, 4 mins).  

However, throughout my 3rd pregnancy (2nd child), they told me that I had to be considered a high-risk pregnancy because of the miscarriage.  I'm confused, and just hoping to get some clarification.  I know many friends and family that have had 1 miscarriage, and they weren't considered high-risk.  I know that 1 miscarriage is common, and really doesn't mean anything other than a random chance occurrence.  

I can understand why recurrent miscarriage is high-risk and all, but I don't understand why one is?  It was kind of obnoxious (I didn't appreciate the extra attention) and really all that it appeared to me was that they could bill more to my insurance with it (I'm weird and look at how much they bill insurance and it was astronomically higher).  There wasn't anything extra other than them making me feel bad every time because they'd say, ""And of course, you're high-risk this time,"" and like they wanted to keep bringing up a really traumatic thing for no reason.  

I asked once why, and they said, ""Poor obstetric history.""  I don't understand how a one-off miscarriage is poor obstetric history when I've also had a clockwork pregnancy (and now two).  I asked if my next will still be high-risk now that I've had two normal pregnancies, and they said, ""You will always be high-risk.""  I'm just not understanding.  I'm 30, healthy and have had no major problems.  I want more babies, but I don't want to feel like I did when they said that.  

Is this normal and I just need to figure out how to feel okay with this, or is there something weird going on?",1,1,2021-12-07,gestational age

Hello,
I was diagnosed with GD about two weeks ago. My numbers aren’t outrageous (the highest it has ever been was today at 144 two hours after a meal while I am sick and not moving around much). My fasting/before meals numbers should be below 95 while my levels two hours post-meal should be below 120. Though I do have the occasional high number post-meal, my biggest problem is my fasting numbers. They are almost always between 96-105. I keep reading that many end up on insulin/meds because of this. I have not had an appt with my OB-GYN yet regarding GD. I have only had appts with the dietitian I was assigned who isn’t concerned at all but the Internet is making me feel like there SHOULD be a concern. I do have an appt with my OB-GYN next week.
I already have pretty terrible anxiety and the readings have turned me into a panicky wreck. I am doing what I know I need to do - watching my carb intake (30-45g per meal, 0-15g per snack), I am pairing that with protein and  fats and I’m drinking so much water. I am becoming obsessive and checking my levels every hour now. I’m definitely spiraling. I just need to know that I am not harming my baby with high numbers.

Is there a number that would be concerning/ I should contact my doc about if I am ever that high? Maybe having a perimeter like that would make me feel much better.",1,1,2021-11-16,gestational age
AskDocs,Does PT/INR show untreated Protein S deficiency?,"- Age: 35

- Race: White
- Duration of complaint: 20 weeks
- Location: USA, Blood??
- Any existing relevant medical issues: 20 weeks pregnant
- Current medications: Prenatal vitamin, 1/2 unisom at night


My lab for protein S deficiency at 7 weeks came back slightly low.  51st percentile.  My doctor was not concerned at first because this is not unusual in pregnancy (although still a bit low for pregnancy).  However, when she asked about any history of clotting issues in my family, I reported that I had heard a first cousin (who I was not close to) who died of a postpartum blood clot allegedly, and my sister had a DVT in her leg after taking three pills of Yaz at one time.  Frankly I am not even sure my cousin really had a blood clot-- she was a heroin addict and after asking for more detail the story my family tells does not make sense.  Sounds like it was made up to cover for an OD, maybe.


I have an absolutely enormous family, especially on that side, and she is the only one who had any kind of clotting issue that I know of, other than my sister.  And I think anyone who takes three Yaz pills at once could get a clot.


This is my second pregnancy, and my first baby did have a pretty significant birth defect (born without part of one of his limbs); however, I was told by orthopedic specialists who work specifically with kids like him that this was spontaneous and occurred around 6-8 weeks gestation, and did not result from clotting.  I had no clotting issues that I know of with the first one, although my OB then was not as thorough as my current one.  I don't think she tested me for clotting issues back then to be honest.  After my son was born with a pretty significant surprise birth defect (and 4 ultrasounds) she claimed it was probably a clotting issue, which is why my new OB checked me out very thoroughly.  


My question is, does a PT/INR show current clotting issues in people who have protein S deficiencies?  So far, I have not yet had this test done.  My OB wants to go ahead and put me on blood thinners, but I am worried about side effects for the baby.  I realize that we believe they are safe, but thalidomide was also considered to be ""safe"" for a time.  As it is, I am not convinced I have a clotting problem beyond the usual that pregnant women experience, and I don't want to take unnecessary risks with medications.  I am only taking the smallest dose possible of unisom because it's been so extensively studied and found to be safe, and I literally could not eat without it.  I have horrible morning sickness still, even at 20 weeks.


I have an Any Lab Test Now appointment to go ahead and find out what my PT/INR is.  I have a referral for hematology set up, but they can't fit me in for about four weeks.  If I really do have a clotting issue, I don't know if it makes sense to risk a clot for four weeks.  My understanding is certain blood thinners are relatively safe in pregnancy, like heparin.  My doc did not offer that, but she did mention it does not cross the placenta.  I think I could convince her to prescribe it instead (maybe), she mostly seemed hesitant because it would require two shots daily instead of one.  But if I don't have a clotting issue and my blood gets too thin, could the baby be at risk if I bleed?  I need to know objectively if I have a real clotting problem or not.


Another thing is that perhaps at 7 weeks the dehydration I was experiencing from morning sickness threw off my results?  I ended up losing 15 pounds in my first trimester, I was so sick. My urine turned red at one point and I nearly went to the ER.  I finally was able to keep water down when I started taking unisom at 9 weeks, although not much else until recently.  I have gained about 5 pounds back, if that matters.  I am much better hydrated now than I was at 7 weeks.


Any info you can give would be a big help.  Mainly I just need to find out how I can objectively tell if I have a clotting problem.  It seems like a PT/INR test is the way to do that, but I can't tell if it would show anything in the case of a protein S deficiency.  Thanks!",1,1,2021-10-28,gestational age

Hello all! My wife is 28 weeks pregnant and she started to develop gestational diabetes, same with her first pregnancy. She started a diet and measuring blood sugar for a month now and although her measurements are good after meals ( ~115 after lunch and ~120 after dinner), the measurement in the morning before eating is relatively high (half times 95-100 and half 90-95).

The doctor that we visited gave her a more strict diet to try for 15 days and suggested that if she doesn't manage to bring down the measurement in the morning before eating, she might need to start taking insulin.

Which are the side effects if she starts taking insulin? Are the measurements bad enough to require medication? Is there a chance for her body to get more 'lazy' and stop producing the hormone which might cause here to have diabetes after pregnancy? Thank you for your time.",1,5,2021-03-31,gestational age

Current med regimen includes the following:
*Pristiq 5mg PO once daily for depression/anxiety
*FerroSul 9mg gummy PO twice daily, to be taken with vitamin C for anemia
*Vitamin C 500mg PO twice daily for enhanced iron uptake
*Hydroxyzine 25mg PO PRN q4 hours for panic attacks
*Xanax 0.5mg PO PRN q4 hours for panic attacks if hydroxyzine is ineffective


In the past, patient has tried Lexapro and Wellbutrin and both seemed to cause more discomfort rather than any therapeutic benefit. Lexapro worked somewhat well, though patient struggled to take it on a regular schedule and subsequently switched to a different antidepressant, Wellbutrin, which brought about more frequent panic episodes and persisting agoraphobia after discontinuation.


Patient now taking Pristiq daily and has been for several weeks without any improvement in symptoms, and recently has acquired hypertension with sys BP consistently >150, increased agoraphobia. Also reports occasional blurred vision and tunnel vision.


Patient family history:

*Mother: Grave's disease, anxiety, depression, anemia, DM-2, HTN

*Father: anxiety, depression, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, PTSD, alcoholism, frequent Rx med abuse, DM-2, HTN, pancreatitis, childhood emotional/physical/sexual abuse


Patient lives at home with boyfriend and has been unable to work for several months due to anxiety and fear of leaving home, worked one shift yesterday and got sent home early due to supervisors saying she looked ill. Often would get sent home from work due to panic attacks at work. Patient smokes cannabis regularly, small amounts 2-3 times daily. No tobacco use, rare alcohol use, averaging one alcoholic drink per week. No illicit drug use besides cannabis. Does not exercise. Diet is pretty good, can go into further detail if needed. 


Patient's biggest concern is that she will feel trapped this way forever, or that she will need to try yet another psych med to get her into a more comfortable headspace. Patient would like to return to work instead of living off her boyfriend's income, though experiences great anxiety any time she is faced with the prospect of leaving the house. Patient also would like to lose weight, though the fatigue and anxiety make it difficult to maintain any amount of physical exertion for very long.",3,3,2021-06-23,gestational age

AskDocs,34 weeks pregnant and baby weighs 2lbs.,"My sister is 34 weeks pregnant and the baby weighed just under two lbs last week (at 33 +1).  My sis sees her two doctors (OB/GYN and MFM) twice a week.  The baby had stalled in growth for a while (I am not sure how long) around the same time that my sister was discovered to have some blood clotting disorders.  She has been on blood thinners since about week 22.  Her OBGYN told us this week that the baby will not reach 4lbs before birth (sometime in the next 6 weeks)and will stay in the NICU until she does reach 4 lbs and can eat on her own.  Her original due date was Dec. 16.  Modified due date was Dec 27.  We were told this week she will not go past Dec 20.  Sis has opted to have a c-section whenever the doctors or her body decides it is time.

I can only find info on babies born that small at 24-26 weeks.  i can't find anything about a baby being that small at this gestational age. the baby has gained 10oz in the past month.  My sister's nurse told her today that this is a miracle baby.  I don't think they ever said as much but it is starting to be clear that the doctors and nurses did not expect the baby to survive this long.

My sister is single, 22, 5'1"".  she weighed about 100lbs but now weighs 124lbs.  she did smoke, drink and do drugs (weed, cocaine, meth) previously but I don't think she has done much more than weed in the 6 months before she got pregnant.  She has always had problems with eating and nausea and now has been diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and some other blood clotting disorders that we had no idea about.  the baby has checked out normal for chromosomal and genetic abnormalities.  No amniocentesis was done. her amniotic fluid values have been between 6 and 8.  baby did have some heart issues (two stenoses and a psuedo hole) but at the most recent ultrasounds the problems seem to have resolved.

Rhogam was not listed on my dispatch paperwork. I never signed saying I got it. I don’t remember getting it. Hospital says they gave it to me but they only have their word, not actual proof. 

I suffered from postpartum hemorrhaging after giving birth to my daughter. I had gestational diabetes during pregnancy that was managed with diet and metformin. I was induced at 39 weeks and my daughter was 8lbs 10oz. 

When my daughter was born they told me she had dandy walker syndrome due to a sonogram that was done at 38 weeks. Went to a neurologist ust who did an MRI and told me it’s a normal variant, she’s perfectly healthy and no follow up is necessary. 

They never massaged my stomach after birth, even with the PPH. They served food with mold all over it. I gave birth a year ago and I’m still sad about my experience.

Hi, so my brother (in his 50s) has been going to a ton of specialists and has learned so much about a condition he has, the name to which I never quite learned but it's a fatal degenerative disease. I started to worry maybe I would have the same thing, so I asked him if he thought my symptoms sounded similar to how his disease started. I have extremely sore hands and feet, and sometimes I lose control of my hands to the point that I will suddenly drop something without realizing I'm about to drop it. I also recently ended up at the hospital thinking I was having a stroke because my right hand suddenly curled up for no apparent reason and stopped working and that freaked me out and I panicked and couldn't answer the FAST questions without crying and then couldn't tell if I was slurring my speech or not. The doctor there figured I was just having an anxiety attack. 

My brother said no, but I may have pregnancy induced diabetic neuropathy. Even though I'm not pregnant anymore, and I don't have diabetes or gestational diabetes even, he said that's one thing that can happen to women.

For several months now I have had unbearably sore hands and feet. This is to the point that it actually feels good if my kids punch and slam things into my hands and feet as hard as possible. Nothing ever relieves the pain all the way. I have had my husband occasionally massage them with black cumin seed blended up with a carrier oil like olive or safflower oil and that actually did relieve the pain for maybe 20-30 minutes, then it came back again. I've also used this on my back for my disc injury, and it does seem to help somewhat.

Is this something I have that is a permanent condition or will it go away eventually?

I am in so much pain all the time I no longer notice the pain at all, except in my hands and feet, but if I can get my husband to so much as touch my skin, it feels as though I'm getting the best massage of my life and I suddenly realize how much pain I've been suppressing all over my body. Just now my daughter bumped into my leg with her foot and it was like the best feeling in the entire freaking world. No I am not on drugs. I am just really dang sore. Like everywhere.

I'm thinking maybe I need to go to a chiro, reflexologist or acupuncturist.

Thoughts?

Edit: For some reason it isn't letting me comment on my own post. Anyhow, regarding the disc injury, yeah it's not exactly bulging or herniated, but it used to be somewhat bulging then shrunk back down. That is an old injury from the lower spine from about 16 years ago (2005) when my first was a baby. I have had a CT scan on it, not an MRI, and it's not severe enough to cause me problems most of the time but through the years it has gone out several times to the point I couldn't walk, and after a few weeks I can walk again if I rest and use a TENS unit. Black cumin seed oil seems to help, as well as a product I used to drink that has it in there. Haven't had a flare up in a while because I can tell when I am about to and I go rest and use a heating pad.",1,2,2021-03-14,gestational age

AskDocs,Help determining date of conception,"26, female, 4 foot 10, 120lbs, Asian. I’m trying to verify the approximate date of conception of my pregnancy. I am currently about 8 months pregnant as far as I know. I had an unwanted sexual experience last September, and then had regular consensual sex with my husband in October. I found out I was pregnant in November and as far as I know the baby was conceived in October. I’m pretty sure it was, but I still get worried that something weird might have happened and caused ultrasounds or hcg levels to be off, like if my body produced hcg so slowly that it seemed like the baby was conceived in October but it was actually earlier? Is this possible?

Data points:  

* Period Sept 9-12 (sex Sept 12)  
* Possible period or spotting Oct 10 (31 day cycle)  
* Positive pregnancy test November 11  
* Quantitative HCG test Nov 12: 882.5 mIU/mL (5-6 weeks?)  
* Ultrasound Dec 20 placing me at 9w6d (expected 10+1 based on LMP)  
* Ultrasound Jan 3 placing me at 12w (expected 12+1)  
* Ultrasound Mar 4 placing me at 19w6d (expected 20+6)  
* Ultrasound Apr 16 placing me at 25w6d (expected 27w)  

A few more points:

* I have had periods ranging from 24-32 days but usually had regular periods around 28 days. I believe my LMP was Oct 10 which was a 31 day cycle from Sept 9-Oct 10. I don’t know if I remembered it correctly or if maybe it was some kind of early pregnancy spotting instead.  
* I took Plan B back in June which led to a couple very short cycles (15 and 19 days) before returning to normal length. I don’t know if that would affect my ovulation pattern.  
* I was taking Monistat before my September cycle hit and don’t know if that has any effect on ovulation timing either.  
* I have always been very petite and was less than 100lbs before pregnancy, I was born full term but physically “premature,” I don’t know if this would have any relation to a baby growing slowly.

No ultrasounds since then and I may not get another one. All the dates seems to indicate conception during October. I am told early ultrasounds are very accurate. But is there any unusual situations that could cause ultrasounds or HCG to be a month off when dating pregnancy? Does a gestational age of 10 weeks (like in my December ultrasound) always indicate conception around 8 weeks ago or is it possible to have conceived earlier than that? Or should I assume that it was definitely October?

Thank you very much in advance.",2,6,2020-06-04,gestational age

My primary care doctor isn't concerned because that seems to be my set point - I've weighed 80 lbs since middle school. And my psychiatrist has told me he's just plain baffled about my case. His hypothesis is that I have a malabsorption disorder of some kind, like small bowel syndrome.

No, I don't have an eating disorder. I eat 2000+ calories a day, 3 meals and two snacks.

I was born at 24 weeks gestation at a very low birth weight of only 1 pound and 8 ounces, and spent 3 months in the NICU where I experienced complications of:

-	Tension Pneumothorax due to perforating my lung while intubated in the NICU. Apparently I also accidentally pulled out my own NG tube too. Yay me! 
-	Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC).
-	Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), probably exasperated by the disseminated intravascular coagulation.
-	A colostomy, had a stoma bag for 6 months until the DIC and NEC got better and my colon could be anastomosed. Good thing I don't remember any of it.
-	Had my bowel resectioned because of the necrotizing enterocolitis. I have a massive scar above my belly button that goes from one side of my stomach to the other.
-	A hole in my heart that later closed. Thank goodness.

Currently as an adult, I still have: 

-	Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) due to 100% oxygen toxicity. I am visually impaired. Doctors tried using scaleral buckles and laser surgery on both eyes when I was born to try and save my retina from detaching but things didn't turn out well. I'm completely blind in my left eye and have 20/100 vision in my right eye. The left eye has a cataract and calcium build up but it's been stable for years and my pediatric ophthalmologist thinks there's no point in risking things and doing surgery to remove it if I can't see out of the eye anyway.
-	Very minor cerebral palsy, caused by intracranial bleeding due to the DIC. I received occupational and physical therapy when I was a young child but I don't remember much of it.
-	Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). I don't experience any symptoms of it at all except for frequent nose bleeds. They're not too bad now that I'm older, but when I was in elementary school, my nose could easily bleed for 30-60 minutes or more. My record is a bloody nose in kindergarten that lasted over two hours because a stray kickball came flying out of nowhere during recess and hit me right on my nose. 
-	I have the Hemoglobin E Thalassemia Minor trait. Thanks, mom and dad.
-	Tachycardia. Resting heart rate of 110+ BPM.

Symptoms: low blood pressure and constant fatigue , occasional dizziness and vomiting after eating.

Diagnosed medical conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, GERD, depression, hemochromatosis 


Some medical history: Was 315 pounds in January 2019. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy 6/3/19 at 282 pounds. Sleeve surgery caused GERD but otherwise no complications. Keyhole cholecystectomy done 6/12/20. 30-40 gallstones removed with gallbladder. 3 pregnancies with two live births via c section in 2010 and 2016 and a miscarriage in 2015

Medications: mirena IUD, wellbutrin, famitodine, pantoprazole, hydroxychloroquine, voltaren topical, CBD 5:1 tincture for arthritis pain 
Supplements: Solimo multivitamin, Caltrate calcium chews, Nature's Bounty hair skin and nails.

When I was obese my blood pressure was borderline for hypertension when not pregnant. When pregnant with my first child I developed pre-eclampsia and my second child gestational hypertension as a result of my weight while pregnant.

Since I started losing weight my blood pressure gradually dropped at every appointment which would be expected as I reached a healthier weight. Since late summer/early fall it's been running in the low end of normal like 95/63. My doctor comments on it being low but hasn't been concerned.

During December I began having issues with the reflux where I was on omeprazole but it wasn't working anymore. Constant sore throat, abdominal pain and heartburn. 12/29 my PCP put me on pantoprazole and famitodine. Blood pressure was 87/59 but doctor didn't say much beyond saying it might be because I was struggling to eat and drink. I have been referred to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy. Last one was done by my bariatric surgery hospital in 2019. PCP is concerned about an ulcer or barrett's esophagus.

Within a few days of starting the new medication i was eating and drinking fairly normally or at least normal for me. As a bariatric patient my intake for calories is around 1100-1200 a day when I am feeling well.

I saw my rheumatologist yesterday 1/8 for a routine visit for my arthritis. My blood pressure was 84/56. I mentioned my fatigue hasn't gotten better although my arthritis pain is fairly well managed between voltaren and cbd. I was taking  naproxen once a day which is  the max my bariatric surgeon  said I could have but stopped at the direction of my pcp because of the reflux.

I have been chalking up my fatigue to stress from both my kids having special needs and the older child having numerous mental health crisis situations in the last few months. My rheumatologist thinks it is possible I could  just be tired from my job and  kids but wants me to have my pcp refer me for a sleep apnea study.

I don't know if everything is related or not. But why would my blood pressure be this low and when is it so low I should be concerned? What could be causing it?",3,2,2021-01-09,gestational age

AskDocs,"3 tests showed protein S deficiency in 2017-18, now tests show normal levels?","Age: 41

Sex: F

Height: 5'3""

Weight: 130 lbs

Location: CA (was in Denmark for earlier tests)

Existing medical issues: Where to start...decades of weird problems but nothing very serious known, have had decades of some kind of autoimmune flares with some arthritis but seems mainly reactive (negative RA, SLE antibodies and CRP has never been elevated but never had blood taken right in middle of a flare), reactive airways (breath test showed no asthma...I worked with noxious chemicals for years), syncope in response to many triggers and POTS as teenager, frequent sterile corneal infiltrates despite not wearing contacts for like 16 years, central serous chorioretinopathy during pregnancy, developed CFS leak from epidural from childbirth that was fixed with blood patch, frequent episodes of bursitis, tendonitis and pinched nerves especially in ankles, Raynaud's in big toe but none since living in CA, Paget Schroetter syndrome which spontaneously resolved in early 20s which I assumed in retrospect was related to discovered protein S deficiency plus being on Yasmin, 2 miscarriages with embryo dating ~6 weeks and ~8.5 weeks, years of infertility, successful pregnancy on Lovenox, mid-60s mother found to have JAK2 mutation with highly elevated platelets and mine have always hovered around top of normal range (400k), just got over first ever episode of chillblains in my feet (have been COVID tested to death including 2 antibody tests and all neg) but still have parasthesia in feet when sitting or lying down and seeing my PCP later this week. Suspect I have a form of EDS. Um this is just a subset of everything. It's like every day is a new malady.

Medications: just vitamin D 1000 iu, Centrum multivitamin, 1 fish oil capsule daily, baby aspirin on and off (lately on with the chillblains but some days I forget). 

OK so onto the actual post. After 2 miscarriages in 2017, I paid myself for a small blood clotting panel at a fertility clinic that could send blood to a private lab in Germany (in Denmark the public health system has a stranglehold on all blood testing). First draw was about 6 weeks after an early miscarriage for which I took Mifegyne/misoprostol at 8 weeks gestation (embryo heartbeat stopped between 7 weeks and 7w2d, measured only 5.5-6 weeks). Came back with total protein S at 38%. About 4 weeks later, took another test because they said the value could be affected by the recent pregnancy (uh by that much from early first trimester?) which came back 43%. Got pregnant again and started enoxaparin 40 mg/day the day of my first positive test 11 dpo, and I continued baby aspirin, and things went better that time. They sent me to a hospital in Copenhagen with a doctor that specialize in blood clotting problems during pregnancy and the doc there redid a full blood clotting panel in the public system when I was about 10 weeks pregnant. Came back all normal except again protein S, this time 48%. Moved back to US when 18 weeks pregnant and they just took my old labs without redoing them and continued prescribing me enoxaparin. 

Fast forward to COVID-19 and I'm nervous about my history and get referred to a hematologist. He reorders protein S bloodwork which was done at Labcorp. Free protein S antigen total is now 76%, free 83%, functional protein S 112%. Now all in normal ranges. I am very perplexed. I've been reading literature about known causes of transient protein S deficiency and none of it really makes sense for me. Any hematologists or anyone else with experience seeing anything like this? I would attribute the previous readings to be incorrect but it was done *3 times* by 2 different labs over the course of several months and all values were below normal even for first trimester.",2,1,2021-02-15,gestational age
AskDocs,[33F] My grandmother died of CLL and now I have lymphocytosis...,"After years of being told ""you're probably just fighting something"" in response to my elevated lymphocyte counts, my new PMD has referred me to a hematologist. My first visit isn't until 9/21, and only after that will I be able to have flow cytometry done. But in the meantime, could someone potentially provide me an impression of what might be going on?

Background on me: I have a history of childhood temporal lobe epilepsy, which has been in remission for 10 years (I don't currently take medication); I take Vyvanse (60mg) for ADD and Wellbutrin extended release (150mg) for depression; I have MODY-2 (mimics diabetes) with consistently elevated fasting glucose levels between 99 and 110 but normal 2-hour glucose tolerance tests (I'm not on any treatment); familial hyperlipidemia; a BMI that generally fluctuates between 18.5 and 19; I don't smoke and I drink infrequently.

Long-term symptoms that I can't explain: I have had nightsweats for 5+ years, but supposedly that is a side effect of Wellbutrin; when I am stressed, I get extremely painful ulcers/canker sores on my gums, back of the throat, under tongue, sometimes hard palate, and in the corners between my cheeks and gums--this has been getting worse in the past 10 years; I have frequent sinus issues; I occasionally get low fevers when I am stressed out; before testing positive for MODY-2 in 2017, I was being worked up for LADA/type 1.5 diabetes and tested positive for GAD-65 autoantibodies and insulin autoantibodies--but I've strangely tested negative ever since.

Family history: My mother has scleroderma and several other autoimmune conditions, but my ANA panels have always come back negative. She also tested positive for the genetic mutation which causes MODY-2 (she also had gestational diabetes when pregnant with me). She and my sister also have consistently elevated LDL levels as I do.

My maternal grandmother was diagnosed with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in 2014 and was treated. It was apparently controlled for a few years, but an incidental finding during a doctor's visit for an infected mosquito bite in 2017 revealed that she had a disseminated fungal infection (mucormycosis) most likely due to CLL having destroyed her immune system. She died just 2 months later on Christmas day, 9 days after her 80th birthday.

I know that CLL is highly uncommon in people under the age of 55, but seeing as my grandmother had it, and we haven't found any concrete evidence that I have an autoimmune condition or chronic infection, I wonder if I may be in the early stages of CLL? One interesting thing is that I used to donate bone marrow for research in the late 2000's, but I was eventually turned away in 2010 because of an issue with my white blood cells. (I've called the lab to see if they can look up the full reason I was told I couldn't donate again).

I also had worsening symptoms starting in March when I thought I had COVID-19 (fever, COVID-toes, gastro symptoms, fatigue, shortness of breath, sore throat, nightsweats, tingling in my limbs)--I got swabbed in April but it came back negative, and I subsequently tested antibody negative in April and May. The gastro symptoms subsided, as did the toe rash and fevers, but I still have bad nightsweats and have noticed that exercise is becoming exceedingly difficult for some reason, whereas I was very active before.

Here are my absolute lymphocyte counts for the past 5 years, all of which have been flagged on the lab results as abnormal: 

7/2016: 3.24 (range: 0.7-3.1 x10E3/uL)
8/2017: 4.39 (range: 0.85-3.9 x10E3/uL)
8/2018: 4.24 (range: 0.85-3.9 x10E3/uL)
10/2019: 3.80 (range: 0.7-3.1 x10E3/uL)
8/2020: 4.67 (range: 0.85-3.9 x10E3/uL)

I know that I wasn't actively sick during my last three blood draws, and most likely not sick for the others. If not CLL or leukemia, what else could it be?

(I also recently tested for inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, which all came back normal)",3,3,2020-09-07,gestational age

Hi all! 
I’ve been on and off monitoring my blood glucose levels for a couple of years. My fasting blood glucose levels are consistently higher than ‘normal’ at around 5.6mmol/L (100mg/dl), which I know is not too bad, but my blood insulin, hbA1c and post meal levels are perfect.

He had a non-fatal drowning about a year ago, he did not need to be resuscitated. No significant head injuries. Otherwise completely unremarkable history. Brother has hypotonic CP.  Family history of Lewy Body dementia and Parkinson’s. 


As long has he has been able to talk, my son has had difficulty with word retrieval. He used circumlocution from a very early age. I thought it was cute, I’ve never heard a 3-year-old describe a banana for 5 minutes because they can’t remember the word “banana.”  He would describe what you do with it, where we keep it in the house, and where to find it in the grocery store.  When he can’t remember “ball,” it’s “the thing the Red Sox throw.”


We just started online school and part of online school in first grade to demonstrate understanding is sorting pictures or putting them in order and then recording yourself explaining. The problem is, he can’t name the pictures.  When that happened I called my pediatrician and he send me SLP resources to help address aphasia. 


My question is: what causes aphasia?  Should we see a neurologist for formal testing?

AskDocs,Hydrocephalus,"Also posted in  r/Medical

I (40F) have congenital hydrocephalus. My last shunt revision was in 1994! I was discharged as a paediatric patient and never had a new neurosurgeon after that.

In 2018 I was suffering migraines and sent for a CT which came back clear. It turns out I was in early stages of pregnancy and developed gestational diabetes early on and needed insulin. The diabetes disappeared after the birth. The diabetes and pregnancy seemed to account for my symptoms as I felt better after I was on insulin and the birth. I delivered via elective c-section as they felt that was safer than labouring or pushing for hours.

However, I am still having headaches and migraines, especially lately. I strongly feel I need an MRI and feel I need a new shunt. I'm not sure if it's a blockage but could I have a cyst or perhaps an infection? Are VP shunts meant to last a lifetime? I just don't feel right. I have written to the hospital I was originally treated in but the notes I received are incomplete. I only know it's a Delta shunt but nothing more. It isn't a programmable shunt, as far as I know. But until doctors know more, they refuse to do an MRI in case it is dangerous? or intervenes with my shunt type. I feel very abandoned and helpless.

I'm not in US. Anyone any advice or experience. My GP did send a referral to a neurosurgeon but due to COVID 19 I'm still waiting. I feel cognitively something isn't right. It's taking an age to type this.",3,1,2020-06-08,gestational age
AskDocs,Questions about NT test/potential chromosomal abnormalities in pregnancy,"I was hoping someone could answer some question about an NT test in pregnancy. If there is a sub that is focused on medical professionals who deal with pregnancy that this question would be a better fit, please let me know! I am going to be following up irl with a medical professional, but the conversation with my family doctor (where I live we don't get OB appointments until 20 weeks) was overwhelming and he didn't seem to have a lot of knowledge about this specifically. I'm waiting to be contacted by a genetic specialist but it may take up to 2 weeks to hear from them. 

I am sorry this post is so long!!!!!

Background info about me (please ask if you need more info):

* Female
* Age 26
* First pregnancy 
* Non smoker
* Overweight (I'm about 5'6 and pre pregnancy I was 200lbs, now I'm about 205 lbs)
* Approximate due date is between Nov 28 - Dec 3
* So I'm about 13 weeks along
* I had an NT test done combined with blood work (was called First Trimester Screening on my paperwork) and it came back as a positive result with the odds of 1 in 200
* My DR said the neck/fluid measurement was normal but there were issues with my hormone levels
* So far I have no other problems in my pregnancy other than pretty bad morning sickness (I am on Dicletin)
* I just had blood drawn to do an NIPT test yesterday and waiting for the results hopefully in 7-10 days.

Questions: 

1) Exactly how accurate is the NT test? I understand it is screening and not diagnostic. I understand it has approximately a 5% false positive rate. Is 5% ""a big"" false positive rate compared to other tests?

2) The cut off for what constitutes a positive NT result seems to vary a lot. My DR said anything under 1:240 is considered positive. My Mom (nurse at hospital, but not in OB) said she was surprised I was given positive result because her hospital characterizes positive as less than 1:200. I see online in some countries they consider it less than 1:150 or less than 1:300. Basically how ""bad"" is this result considering it seems to be on the borderline of what a lot of places consider positive result?

3) Can a NT test combined with blood work be inaccurate/give a false positive if I am not at the gestational age (not sure if this is the right term sorry) that they think I am at? The reason why I ask this is because based on my periods my doctor assigned me the due date of Nov 28, an early ultra sound done at about 6 weeks said this was accurate. When I went for my ultrasound at 12 weeks to get this NT done, the ultrasound tech said the due date wasn't accurate and the test couldn't be done because the baby was only measuring 4cm and need to be at least 4.5cm for the test. She said I was more likely 10 weeks a long at this point but then after she did more measurements she said maybe 11 weeks. I understand that basing on periods is not always accurate and ovulation doesn't necessarily happen at the same time, but to me this new due date wouldn't make sense in terms of when I began having pregnancy symptoms and had a positive pregnancy test result. So I had to wait another week to get the NT test done. I am wondering if it was at the wrong time, could this affect the results? 

4) If the result is accurate, based on having normal neck/fluid measurements and wrong hormone levels what are the more likely chromosomal problems? (Again, I understand this is screening and I would diagnostics, I am just curious). 

5) How much more accurate is an NIPT test compared to an NT? Especially rate of false positives?

6) In terms of diagnostics.. What is the difference between a CVS and amniocentesis? Which is more accurate? Which is higher risk?

7) Based on the result of a 1:200 chance on the NT and a 1:200 chance of miscarriage doing an amniocentesis, would you do further testing or would it be considered too risky?",3,1,2020-05-28,gestational age

Here’s the timeline of illness:

Friday night: heartburn/acid reflux when lying down which turned into me throwing up everything I ate that day. Assumed I ate something bad. I’ve had acid reflux this whole pregnancy so nothing new. 

Saturday: still felt a little weird from last night but felt better over the course of the day. Then felt nauseous again come nighttime. Again as soon as I go to bed I start regurgitating then vomiting everything. 

Sunday: wake up feeling uninterested in food but not nauseous. Lots of burping/reflux stuff. Start having watery diarrhea that subsides in the afternoon but then returns at night. Didn’t throw up that night. 

Monday: generally feeling shitty but no nausea. Lots of burping. Still diarrhea but it comes and goes. 

Tuesday: feel totally fine. Normal appetite, no diarrhea. Back to my old self. 

I have no idea what this was and I’m worried it could have been dangerous or contagious to my husband or baby. I never even ran a low grade fever, so my doctor suggested it was a sensitivity to my iron supplements, which I stopped taking on Sunday. Recovery happened really suddenly. I’m very worried it could have been covid,  but my husband is in the house 24/7 and the last time I left the house was to see my OB, where I wore full PPE including goggles and N95. That was 10-11 days before I started feeling sick. My doctor doesn’t think it was covid. My parents think it was just “weird pregnancy stuff.” Meanwhile I’m terrified my husband is about to fall sick.

My initial transvaginal u/s record I requested. My OBGYN placed me on high risk.  I don’t know how to read all of the numbers- perhaps a little while on google can teach me to read the ultrasound but crowdsourcing also does get the mind working and food for thought.

AskDocs,Why won’t you let me get my tubes tied?,"i have heard so far:

Reason: i’m too young

Problems with this:
- I’m 23 and, as long as i’m over 18, am allowed to make my own medical decisions. for instance: if i asked for a boobjob, or liposuction, or wanted a mastectomy, i would be able to get one.

Reason: i may change my mind when i’m older

Problems with this: 
- I have no interest in pregnancy. It looks painful and uncomfortable and shitty and no thanks. Nothing about pregnancy or birth appeals to me in the slightest. I fully intend on adopting children or having a surrogate.

- Pregnancy is dangerous, especially for black women. Black women are [four times more likely to experience life threanting complications in the united states during labor than white women](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/02/20/why-are-black-women-at-such-high-risk-of-dying-from-pregnancy-complications) , and [in the united states women are dying 26.4 per 100,000 people while giving birth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_mortality_in_the_United_States#Maternal_Mortality_Is_Rising_in_the_U.S._As_It_Declines_Elsewhere) . Not ONLY that, [it’s been proven that in medicine black people are often believed to simply feel less pain, for a plethora of dumb reasons, and are given less medication because of that assumption](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/how-we-fail-black-patients-pain) 

- if i do, on the off chance you are right, then i will face the consequences of that choice, when it comes. as i am an adult, and that’s how life works

Reason: i need to discuss it with my husband first

Problems with this:
- I am not married, and whether I get married or not I, as an adult, do not need permission from anyone else to make my medical decisions for me. I do not need a mans permission to get my teeth pulled, i don’t need a mans permission to get my tubes tied.

- It is stupid 

Reason: I could just take birth control

Problems with this:
- Birth control is unbearable. It. Is. TERRIBLE. WHY ARE THEY ALL TERRIBLE?! the hormones, the weight gain, the headaches, the nausea, they can make period symptoms worse, the acne, they sometimes hurt, it affects my sex drive, the way each one affects you differently and it may change from cycle to cycle and it may even change how it affects you if you use it then stop using it and then start again and it often can give you months of bleeding...no. Not even mentioning the possibly fatal side effects. 

- When men want to get vasectomies they aren’t offered birth control

So, why can’t I, an adult person of sound mind and body, who doesn’t want to get pregnant, get my tubes tied if I am willing to pay for it/my insurance will cover it?

Edit: misquoted source and more reasons birth control sucks

Edit 2: if there are any other men, or frankly any other person, who is eager to tell me how i am young and dumb and don’t know better, and about how childbirth is amazing, and how i’ll change my mind once i hold my baby or whatever, all because i don’t want to give birth, please, let me tell you now, fuck off. fuck off so hard in the face. i so, SO, don’t care about what you have to say. You can go die in a hole. ESPECIALLY if you are a man telling me how easy pregnancy and labor are because your WiFe dId iT...are you kidding?? stop.

Edit 3: I do not want to wait 10 years or see how i feel when i get married. i have no interest in my fertility, and if my husband does not agree i will not be marrying him. as a woman it is not my job to give anyone a baby. there are thousands, literally thousands, of children, specifically black children, in orphanages and foster homes who need families. If i decide to have kids, and that is a LARGE HEAVY IF, i will adopt or have a surrogate if for some reason despite my families medical history and my own neurodiverisity i decide to say fuck all that and have biological children. No one is trying to convince me of this, in fact i’m more often being tried to convince to change my mind and be pregnant. NOOOOOOOOO. no. thank you.",2318,757,2020-07-27,birth experience
AskDocs,[Serious] Gynecologists of Reddit: Why is the average gynecologist reluctant to pursue an endometriosis diagnosis/dismissive of pain?,"Age: 27, female, 5’1. Endometriosis. Symptoms were extremely painful debilitating cramps during the first day of my cycle along with vomiting, fever, and almost passing out. 

I am one of many patients who have suffered endometriosis for YEARS before finally having enough and needing to find a specialist who would take my pain seriously and get me my diagnosis. This is such a common theme with woman with endo and it’s really sad. Extreme period cramps are not normal and shouldn’t be overlooked. Since I was 15 (diagnosed endo at 27) I have expressed my pain many times and the only answer they gave me was birth control. Once birth control was barely helping my pain, they only suggested me taking it to where I no longer get a period or get it every 3 months. I chose the 3 month option but I eventually asked for higher pain meds, since I did not wish to fully stop my period and naproxen barely helped me, and got denied as if I was some junkie just looking for pills. I’ve asked about the possibility of endo many times and got dismissed. They didnt want to do any surgeries unless I was ready for kids, which is ridiculous because it can continue to grow and cause serious permanent damage if not removed. It wasn’t until this year I had to find a specialist to get taken seriously, and she scheduled a lap for me right away without hesitation. Endo was found and removed via excision and for the first time in my life during my period, no more pain. My life was significantly changed after this, I felt like it was a miracle honestly. But why couldn’t this have been done years ago? I am just disappointed and feel like I was gaslighted this whole time, and this is so extremely common amongst others with endo. Is it lack of training? Do they want to just move on to the next patient? I’m genuinely curious.

Edit: I was not expecting this much engagement with this post, but thank you so much everyone who took the time to share your stories and opinions!! It’s so interesting to see everyone’s different views and experiences. And thank you so much for the silver and other awards!! You all are amazing! For those still struggling btw, you are strong, and you got this. Never ever give up on finding the treatment/diagnosis you deserve, and I mean that for any condition, not just endo.",754,141,2021-12-16,birth experience
AskDocs,How can I get rid of this insane exhaustion which has ruined my life for over a decade?,"I'm 24F. I literally just cannot get up no matter how much I tell my body to move. I spend several hours getting up from bed. When I, after hours, finally do manage to get up, my body is so, so heavy to carry around. I lose my vision/black out for several seconds after standing up and sometimes have to grab something in order not to fall, sometimes if it's really bad my arms start to spasm. Lifting my arms is hard. Brushing my teeth is hard. Taking a bath is hard and takes so long because it's hard to move around. When I breathe, it feels somehow like the air does not contain not oxygen for me.

Even when lying down, I feel weak and do not recover from relaxing/lying down. It's like my muscles or whole body is kind of ""summing"" or tingling even when lying down.

I also feel extremely cold all the time. I have dark circles under my eyes and am pale. Even when I use foundation and concealer, you can see my dark circles. I drink over 2 litres of water every day. I eat healthy - roasted vegetables and ground beef usually. I don't cook in oil or butter, just water. No candy. Almost never any bread. Lactose free milk. Eggs, smoothies. No seasoning except salt and very little pepper.

My BMI is currently around 17.3-17.7 (48-49 kgs/106-108 lbs, 167 cm/5'6""), but I am trying to get it up by eating more, but it is difficult because I feel sick every time I eat  (chronic illness I've had for 15-16 years now) - it hurts/is painful, I lose all energy immediately, like out of the drain at once, I get nauseous, extremely bloated, feel a burning sensation in lower abdomen, I get water and food stuck in my throat several times a day and have to cough for several minutes sometimes, regurgitate the food up to seven hours after and therefore can't lie down in bed several hours after eating even though I'm depleted of energy, so I often fall down on my desk instead while sitting. Like in the movies.

Because of the exhaustion, just getting up and making/preparing food (and buying groceries) is a marathon itself, and often I lie hungry in bed but just cannot get up to get food because I'm so tired. Then I get even more tired, and it's even harder to get up. Sometimes I have to slide down from bed and onto the floor, sit there for a couple of minutes and then get up, black out for a couple of seconds, and finally drag my body to the fridge. Lol.

When I finally do get up, I am not less tired. I am exactly as tired as lying down, just standing, and I of course get more tired from standing.

I've done yoga the past five days despite having a cold (which has lasted since the 25nd of December 2020) because I really wanted to get stronger, but I feel completely done for during and after it and have experienced no extra energy. I have tried running for 3 weeks in a row before and felt the same. I am sort of afraid of exercising because it sometimes induces stomach pain, but have started yoga again now... before that I went for 30 min. - 1/2 hour walks every day, which is the best ""exercise"" I can do long-term without feeling pain. Even then I've walways felt tired during and after walks, often had old couples/ladies walking past me and so on.

I take multi-vitamin pills. Blood tests confirmed D vitamin levels were fine, so were B and TSH levels. No gluten or lactose intolerance. I had pretty low iron levels however 1.5 years ago (was told if it went down with 0.5 units more, I would have needed blood transfusion) and got iron pills, however I had to stop because they made my stomach pain and constipation really bad. I am very scared to try them again, but I am taking some other iron supplements that are more natural-based but also very low in iron compared to actual iron tablets (200 mg a day). With the multi-vitamin pills, I get around 21mg a day. Along with that, I eat spinach, meat and green beans, beetroot, etc., i.e. high-iron food.

I skip my period every second time with birth control. Since taking the pills, I have started to experience pretty bad period pain that I did not have before (which seems strange to me since they apparently often alleviate period pain?).

Anyway this is how tired I feel despite eating healthy, drinking plenty of water, taking vitamins and iron supplements, doing exercise...

What the fuck should I do at this point? I'm desperate for anything that actually works. I lose insane amounts of time to it, and it has made studying/socialising/doing anything extremely difficult... I just want a better life. A life that is not exhausting.

**Edit:** thank you all so much for your suggestions and support, I am trying to research everything you mentioned and reply to all or most of you but there are so many comments, I really cannot believe so many people read this insanely long post lol.",476,261,2021-01-23,birth experience
AskDocs,"19afab After quitting hormonal birth control, is it normal to experience two periods right after each other?","I'm 19, afab, 165 cm tall, 45 kg heavy, white, duration of complaint is...2 days? Location: the reproductory system. I have endometriosis, currently taking Ritalin. 



Hello! I had to quit hormonal birth control due to different medical things that I would rather not disclose unless they're needed, and at first everything was fine. I had my normal period for about 9 days (my usual amount of days), then for two days everything was okay, but now I'm bleeding again.



At first I wanted to call my obgyn but I thought I'd try to search for answers on the internet before potentially making a fool out of myself in case this turned out to be a normal thing. However, I couldn't find anything about this, I found only articles talking about delayed or long periods.




So far I've been bleeding again only for 2 days (yesterday it was so little that I didn't even realise until I looked at the underwear in the laundry bin today, that's why I'm sorting this out today and not yesterday) and it's of note that I am not in pain so far (I have endometriosis and I've never had a day on my period when I wasn't at least in some amount of pain, especially so when I wasn't taking birth control).




Is this normal? Or should I call my doctor?",1,2,2021-05-26,birth experience
AskDocs,Can I decline a pelvic exam and still be prescribed birth control?,"Hi! I'm a 20 year old female in USA who is on birth control pills prescribed by my OBGYN. I've been seeing her since I was 14 for birth control. I'm wondering if my doctor would still write me my birth control prescription if I decline a pelvic exam? My reasons for declining have to do extremely personal trauma I've experienced in my past. I understand I'm declining a cancer screening but in the meantime while I'm still young I'm not too concerned as my family has no history of cancer. I'd absolutely still visit my obgyn for blood pressure/chatting for a yearly check in. And hopefully once I'm in a better place mentally and older I will be more concerned with having an exam. But for the time being I feel immensely against it. I'm just wondering if having a pelvic exam is mandatory in order to prescribe birth control pills. I'm taking the pills not as a contraceptive, but for regulating and to ease cramps. Thank you for reading!

Edit: Just adding that I'm turning 21 next month which my dr told me is the age when the physical exams will start. I have not expressed my feelings regarding the physical exam to her yet though.

Edit part 2: I'm sooo thankful to everyone who responded! I really didn't know anything of the reasoning on why these exams are done/important so I totally see now why they are important to get done. I'd definitely like to get the exams done at some point (hopefully soon). I'm working with my therapist regarding any trauma or reservations I have with my body and being touched for whatever reason. Its just my impending gyno appointment is coming up and I'll be 21by then so I was really freaked out and having an anxiety attack when I realized this and thats what fueled me to post on reddit lol It seems like the general consensus of the comments say I'm allowed to decline with explaining my trauma history with my doctor. I feel that she would be compassionate enough to allow me some more mental healing time. I'm grateful for all the other alternatives I learned of like the self administered test, anxiety medication, ect so I'm glad there are other options to move forward too other than outright declining. Thank you also to anyone who shared their similar experiences I'm comforted to know I'm not alone and the only one dealing with a concern like this <3 I have MAJOR confidence going into my upcoming gyno appointment knowing where my rights/consent stand, and of the possible outcomes that could be offered

AskDocs,"Infant girl three weeks of age has had two choking incidents , one of which made her spend her first Christmas in hospital.","Bit of a heavy one here, but I NEED advice.
(Also sorry for the spelling and grammar I’m not the smartest when it comes to that stuff.)

So on the first of December I gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl. She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because ‘that’s how babies are designed ‘ , but they didn’t see it , they didn’t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things.
Nevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn’t of helped her.

Fast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.

Now here’s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree! 
Now me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can’t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don’t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can’t enjoy any time with her because I’m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can’t over the past few days. I don’t know what to do , does anybody have advice or has anyone been through similar experience?",360,142,2020-12-26,birth experience
AskDocs,I think I have sexual aversion disorder but I have no idea why.,"Female, 27, 5'2"", 120 lbs, no medications (not even birth control), not a smoker, rarely drink

So this is an issue that sprang up seemingly out of nowhere. For years (as a teen/young adult) I had a perfectly normal/healthy sex life. 

After a couple years of being with my current partner (now husband) things started to get weird for me. I noticed my sex drive was lower and I started feeling ""gross"" after sex.  And it slowly kept getting worse and turning into full blown sexual anxiety to the point where I now panic a little bit at any kind of sexual contact with my husband and actively avoid it. I dont even really like kissing and sometimes hugging/cuddling is too much. The thought of sex tends to repulse me.

I feel repulsed by erotic imagery whereas before it didnt really bother me.

I have never been raped or experienced any kind of sexual trauma from my husband or anybody in my past. Also my husband is very supportive and has never done anything to make me feel bad or guilty about having sex, or not wanting to have sex, he doesn't pressure me to have sex when I dont want to, doesn't judge me... yet I still feel terrible because I know he desires physical affection like anybody else.

I just dont know what to do

Edit: somebody here asked if I've had bloodwork and checked for thyroid issues, I did about a year ago.

Edit 2: since a few people have suggested maybe I wasnt very sexually fulfilled and that's why this started happening... I'd like to add that my sex life with my husband was one of the best I've ever had before all this!  like, above-par meaning exceeding expectations. It was great and thrilling and we've always communicated about sex really well! So..I dont think that's the problem :/",440,110,2020-04-17,birth experience
AskDocs,"24F, feeling very sick after accidentally inhaling a lot of fumes from rotten potatoes. Could I have solanine poisoning?","24F, 5’6, 111 pounds, Caucasian, never smoked, almost never drink, no recreational drugs, located in Charleston, SC. History of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type III along with a number of comorbidities, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal issues. More details on medical history at end of post.

There has been a smell coming from my pantry for the last several days that I haven’t been able to identify. Today, I opened the door and just got hit with this wall of fumes, and I decided enough was enough. I spent about half an hour tearing it apart and smelling every single thing in it. By the time I identified the potatoes and threw them out, I was feeling pretty terrible. My head kills, I’m super nauseous, and I’m having chest pains.

I looked it up online and read that rotten potato fumes can be extremely toxic, but it’s hard to tell if I’m feeling awful because of toxins or because the smell and activity triggered flares of my pre-existing conditions (see below). It’s not uncommon for me to experience chest pains just from walking around the kitchen for a while, and I have a headache and nausea for the better part of most days as it is. It feels worse than normal, but not so much worse that it couldn’t be a heightened version of the regular stuff.

That being said, I have been experiencing some other unexplained symptoms over the last few weeks that I wonder might have been caused by inhaling the fumes before they were as noticeable. I’ve been experiencing random spikes in temperature (99.6-100) that last for about 12-18 hours, go away, and then pop back up again a few days later. I’ve also lost weight (from 122 to 111 in less than a month) with no changes in diet, and I’ve had pretty bad diarrhea and abdominal pain too (mostly upper right, but it kinda moves around). I’ve also had really bad dry eyes and dry mouth. (My rheumatologist has suspected Sjogren’s for a while and ordered a lip biopsy recently, so that’s happening soon.) I also have had a sore throat (kinda burns, probably related to dry mouth) and swollen glands.

I have an unrelated diagnostic laparoscopy scheduled for next month, and they’re going to test me for covid before that. I don’t think I have covid, and neither does my doctor. Mostly because the fever has been so off-and-on, and I’ve had no cough at all. But I’ll be tested in the next few weeks regardless.

I just don’t know how to tell whether the worsened symptoms I’m experiencing should be worrying me or not. I sent a message to my doctor, but the office doesn’t open for several hours, and she probably won’t see my message until the end of the work day anyway (that’s the time of day she usually sends me messages). If there’s a chance I’m experiencing poisoning, what steps should I take to manage it until I hear from my doctor?

Health issues: EDS (type III), POTS, mitral valve prolapse, MCAS, pernicious anemia, gastroparesis, IBD, GERD, interstitial cystitis, idiopathic hypersomnolence, small fiber neuropathy, cervical instability, scoliosis, kyphosis, tortuous colon, vestibular adenitis (two past surgeries for this), and unexplained eosinophilia (pending hematology referral). Suspected esophageal dysmotility (doctor wanted to do a manometry, but I declined because it sounds awful, so this is unconfirmed). Suspected endometriosis (pending laparoscopy). Suspected Sjogren’s (pending lip biopsy).

Meds:

Ditropan (10 mg/day), Metoprolol (75 mg/day), Nexium (80 mg/day), Sunosi (150 mg/day), B12 (1000 mg/day), Nexplanon birth control implant

I have had no recent changes in meds apart from my cardiologist upping my metoprolol from 50 to 75 mg/day because I’ve been dealing with shortness of breath, presyncope, and chest pains more often than normal lately due to inactivity (thanks, quarantine).

AskDocs,Birth control caused masculinization?,"F21 I need advice because I don’t understand what’s happened to my body. 

I’ve taken a strong antiandrogenic bc since August 18 until july 20 because I had some bodyhair on my stomach and a little bit on my face and my gyn prescribed me that. I have to note that i had absolutely no other issues ( no acne, maybe a bit oily skin, full hair, very feminine body shape, regular period).
Unfortunately I took it without having any hormones tested. 
After a year maybe (end of 19/ early 20) I noticed that my hair was a bit thinner, my bodyshape changed (hips and Butt were flatter, waist got wider, boobs smaller) and my bodyhair increased. In June 20 i got diagnosed with hashimotos, so I decided to stop bc in July. Since approximately June I’ve had bad hairloss that increased 3 months after stopping bc. After stopping bc my bodyhair increased again, my bodyshape looks like it did when I was 11 maybe, no hips, no waist, nothing. 
I went to an endo and she wants to put me back on bc, which I understand but I’m horrified about taking it again, because that started everything even being a strong antiandrogenic one. I am absolutely done mentally, I’m just crying, depressed and can’t get anything done, because I just want to be normal again, like I was pre- bc or even the first year of bc. I have no problem with taking medication as long as it helps me, I get that some woman experience these side effects when they’re taking bc with androgenic components. I hope someone has any advice. The birth control even lists virilization as a side effect, but I just don’t understand how it’s possible when antiandrogenic bc are supposed to block this kind of stuff. 

Ps. I’m not a native speaker, so feel free to ask me anything, if you didn’t unterstand what I was saying. The name of my birth control is „maxim“ in Germany.",424,46,2021-05-07,birth experience
AskDocs,Something concerning happened yesterday and I'm not sure what to think about it.,"21F. 5'2, 120lbs. Caucasian. No drinking, smoking, or recreational drug use. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Type III. Only daily medication is Kariva birth control. As needed, I take benadryl for allergic reactions (trigger unknown, in the process of being tested), ketorlac eyedrops for episcleritis flares, and pepcid for some stomach problems. 

Yesterday was a generally normal day until the night came around. I was hanging out with a friend from class and she invited me to go to this (socially distanced) event on campus.

I went, and not long after we got there I started feeling... odd. It's a hard feeling to describe but I'll do my best. It felt like my brain was trying to escape through the front of my head - just a weird sensation of pressure. And then my left hand started tingling and going numb. I tried my best to ignore it, but then things started to feel like I was in a dream. Nothing felt real for a period of time.

After this sensation hit, my memory was spotty. One minute I was sitting at a desk playing a round of Kahoot, the next I was up on the stage singing Disney karaoke with a few friends, but I don't actually remember getting on stage, or really getting off stage either. 

The next thing I remember was leaving the event, and at that point the feeling that I was in a dream started to fade, and I started to register what just happened as well as the fact that my memory of the evening was spotty. The rest of the night I had a moderate headache that hurt whenever I moved my head, but it wasn't unbearable. Today I've been getting the same feeling of pressure in my head as well as a tingling sensation in my left hand on and off, but not nearly as bad as it was yesterday. No more feeling unreal, and no more memory blackouts, though.

I reached out to some of the people I remember seeing during this event and asked if I was acting weird. They all said that I was acting normally and it didn't seem like anything was wrong, other than me mentioning once or twice that I wasn't feeling the greatest.

In my life I've had quite a few weird experiences medically speaking, but I've never experienced anything like this. I don't know what to think here, but that all was extremely unpleasant and I'm just scared that this is going to happen again.

Edit: Thank you all for your responses. I reached out to my PCP and explained the situation to her. She said that given my medical history that it was likely that I experienced a weird type of migraine or a weird type of seizure, and gave me a referral to a neurologist. 

She didn't seem to think that I was drugged in any way. That being said, I have an internship this summer that I have to pass a drug test for. I'd rather not find out from my employer that I was drugged, so on the off chance that this is the case, I'm going to pick up an at home testing kit from the grocery store just to be sure.

NICUParents,I missed her bath,"Just need to rant. (Born at 34+1 & has been in NIcU for a week so far). I had a hard time waking up. I pumped and was ready to head to see my daughter to give her a bath. Then I realized I lost the parking pass. I looked all over for it but couldn’t find it. On my drive in all the radio kept playing was melancholy music. I started crying. I have already missed her bath time and was maybe going to make it for feeding. 
And on the elevator ride up a fellow nicu parent said hi, and her “good morning attitude” immediately made me feel better. 

Then I realized I can just ask for another pass, didn’t need to stress over it.

Just made me realize that being alone without my baby and stuck in my own thoughts, that I have to be careful not to get too carried away with things out of my control and recognize what I can do to address a situation. 

Turns out, she had to have a bath overnight anyways from some pretty big BMs. So I missed it anyway.
I made it in time to feed her. And received a new parking pass.

NICUParents,Post-NICU bonding?,"Hi everyone! So we brought our daughter home after 58 days in the NICU. Very fortunate to have no additional measures needed at home (no oxygen or feeding tubes etc). Now she has been home for 3+ weeks and the 24/7 care has been exhausting. 

I feel like in a weird way the bonding has shifted since she came home. Like I’m not as bonded. Is that just the sleep deprivation talking? I’ve not had much support from friends and family due to Covid restrictions and that really broke my heart. I have had a post partum doula come so I can sleep. My husband used up his paternity leave during the birth and right after so he can’t be home with me right now so it’s 90% all me. I feel a sense of pressure and responsibility I’ve never felt before in my life and it feels relentless. 

I also have 5 other friends having babies and all of them have gone to term with their babies. I feel like I don’t know when my baby is going to be like theirs and so there is this odd dynamic of she older than all the other babies but behind them in development. 

I guess I just don’t know what to expect any more and I’m afraid to be happy because what if some wierd stress is right around the corner?

I’be also had a hard time physically recovering from pregnancy because of the stress of the pandemic and the NICU. My body feels way out of whack and I’m uncomfortable most days.

NICUParents,My story. As shared on Facebook originally,"The NICU. 

I’ve kept our story pretty much off Facebook. Since it is NICU awareness month, I felt like sharing. 

The one word I would describe my whole experience would be lucky. 

I had preeclampsia with William, however it was pretty mild and was at full term. Throughout my pregnancy I was told that there was only a 25% chance of it happening again, my BP and everything else, was consistently okay til my 28 week appointment. My BP was 140/95, not great at all. 

The next 4 weeks were not great. I spent a weekend in the hospital for a UTI that was out of control, was put on bed rest with a busy toddler who was in school and I gradually got sicker and sicker. 

Then came Valentine’s Day. My feet were so horrifically swollen, my blood pressure consistently between 150/100 and 160/110. I ended up being in a bit of denial and went to the doctors office to see if I needed to go to the hospital. Of course they said yes. 

My stubborn self went to Target to get stuff because I figured I’d be in the hospital for a while as I was 32 weeks the following day. 

I was admitted and my BP was treated and became manageable. I was told the plan was to keep me in the hospital until I was 34 weeks or we had to deliver, whatever came first. Tearfully, I agreed to the plan, even though that meant being away from William for a pretty long time. 

I should mention that our new house we are leasing, the lease starts February 20th. So my entire house is set to move, while I’m in Hospital. 

So I settled in to the routine of bed rest, getting my blood pressure checked every few hours and non stress tests every 6 hours. 

On February 17th, during one of the NSTs, Riley failed it. They brought in our favorite ultrasound guy and the girl he was training and they performed a biophysical profile. They explained that they have 30 minutes and in that 30 minutes they have to see certain things like limb movement, breathing, etc and each of the 5 things they see is scored and given 2 points, an 8 or 10 is passing. Riley scored a 6. That meant she would have to redo it in a few hours. At this point, I was being mentally prepped for delivery, at 10pm at night. After she failed her NST, they have me call Brandon in, even though he was at home with William for the night. 

At about midnight or 1, we did the second biophysical profile. I don’t think anyone in the room was speaking. I remember the ultrasound tech taking over from the girl he was training at some point halfway through, without saying anything. The half hour ended. I asked what the score was. 

He said “it was a 2”. 

My heart sank. 

Pretty soon our whole team was in my room and I’m getting ready for a c section at 1 am. I’m 32 weeks and 2 days. I had to hold it together. We have a NICU baby no matter what. 

I went into surgery. My nurse was a nurse I will NEVER forget. She had accidentally snapped my underwear in a weird accident earlier in the week. She also volunteered to do my c section every night she was on call if I needed one. Melissa, you have a heart of gold. 

My csection went. Not my first time being here, so I wasn’t super freaked out. Miss Riley came out though and there wasn’t joy in the room. Instead she went immediately to the NICU team who stood in the corner anticipating her arrival. Brandon and I saw her briefly, she was lifeless and purple. I tried to pretend I hadn’t seen her as they tied my tubes, I don’t want any more kids after this experience. 

The anesthesiologist shared with the team just how much medicine he had given me and they immediately put me on magnesium. I was bed bound for 24 hours. 

I was wheeled to see Riley in the NICU shortly after my surgery, before or after mag, I don’t remember. I saw her and put my finger in her isolette and she grabbed onto it. My nurse exclaimed at how wonderful it was.

To be admitted into Good Sams NICU, a baby has to be 32 weeks and 1500 grams. Riley was 32 and 3 and 1520. By the skin of our teeth, we made it into Good Sams NICU. 

The next few days were rough. My BP was not cooperating. I was pumping as much as I could for her and thankfully, was able to provide for her. 

Day 3 or 4 (my memory is fuzzy) I walked in to see her, walking by the urge of my amazing post partum nurse Nichole. Our NICU nurse, gosh I hope I remember this right, Jenni, said “I heard you haven’t held her yet, do you want too?”. I was alone. No phone. Nothing to remember this by. I was honestly scared out of my mind but I said yes. I held Riley. My heart absolutely soared. I felt like the grinch, not knowing my heart could grow anymore than it already had, it grew to hold my daughter in it. 

No sooner had I held her did I find out she had a blockage potentially. They did an X-ray, took her off oral feeds and back on TPN for a few days. 

For those who don’t know, TPN, total parenteral nutrition, is a way to feed, completely bypassing the GI tract. It is incredibly harsh on little ones veins and Riley had few veins to spare. 

I kept at it. Pumping. Bed rest. Watching way too much of Real Housewives. Checking in on Riley as much as I could tolerate. Finally, 8 days after my c section, I was told the magic words, I could go home. 

My heart broke a little bit leaving the hospital, knowing my daughter was still a patient. However, I was absolutely overjoyed to see my son at home. Brandon had moved the guest bed downstairs for me, so I could heal and not go upthe stairs too many times. That night and the nights to follow, William refused to sleep anywhere but tucked up with me. 

Back to Riley. TPN was ruining her veins. Although she was upping her oral feeds, things were moving slowly. Should they run out of sites to place her TPN before her oral feeds were sufficient to feed her, she would need a central line. That’s not something Good Sams NICU can accommodate long term, she would have to be transferred out, to Tacoma General, if they had openings or Seattle Children’s, if Tacoma was full. For a few days, my heart was in my stomach. My daughter was 10 minutes down the road. I could handle that. Any further and I would break. I prayed furiously. Somehow, someway, we managed to get her off TPN and fully tube fed during her last IV site.  

By now, I am off pain meds and feel fine, so I decided to try and drive. Brandon was still at home, so he would take William to school and I would spend my days at the NICU. Cuddling Riley, pumping and watching way too many true crime TV shows on my phone. 

In this time I met with Social Workers, Speech Therapist’s, occupational therapists, physical therapists, nutritionists, doctors, nurses, technicians. I kept a notebook and have it still but am slightly too traumatized to go back and read it. It was a lot. 

Brandon went back to work, so he could take a week off when Riley came home. My schedule became crazy. Take William to pre k by 9, rush to the hospital, spend from 915-1135 with Riley, pick up William at 1150, stay home and cook an early dinner, leave by 4, spend from 4-9/10 in the NICU. Soon, I had grandmas picking William up, so I wouldn’t even have to leave her in the middle of the day.  Life was hard. I was up every 3 hours pumping for her as I needed to continue our breastfeeding journey, I felt as if I owed her that much. The next 2 weeks were a blur. NICU, home, sleep, repeat. 

William struggled during this time. The uncertainty of who would pick him up, where was mom and what was going on, clearly took a toll on him. I firmly believe that the hardest part about all of this was how big of a toll it took on my toddler. He had no clue what was going on a and within days, he had to move homes, his mom was gone and his whole world was different, even when I came back home. 

We got her to latch in the NICU, it was amazing. Our feeding plan was one of nursing and supplanting with Neosure. I was stoked. 

She continued to gain weight. Slowly making it to 4 pounds. I became more confident and started taking over her cares, doing diaper changes, changing her clothes, taking her temp and moving her from her bassinet. She was mine. I was hers. It was a great feeling. 

Watching her monitors was tough. Riley liked to desat and have bradycardia episodes a little too frequently. Once we got to the point where they were a little less frequently, we talked about going home. It’s almost like saying “beetle juice” three times in the NICU, you don’t talk about going home until it’s literally in your face. 

We had it in our minds that she would come home on St.Patricks day, March 17th. Her last barrier was the car seat test. Could she sit in it and not have a Brady event for 90 minutes. My hopes were just a little too high. She couldn’t. So I held her and cried to myself, knowing I have it way better compared to many, many NICU moms out there. I went home and pretended to be happy with William, I gave him some green cake I made and made pesto pasta, green food, for the occasion. But I was hollow inside. 

The next day, my feet swelled up. Terrified it was my blood pressure acting up, because I was on a myriad of drugs for blood pressure, I arranged for a grandma to pick up William from school and went to urgent care for myself. I called the NICU to let them know I wouldn’t be there for Riley’s care and to just bottle feed her without me. Thankfully, there was nothing clinically wrong with me and I was given a diuretic and sent on my way. I sat in my car and remember feeling like the weight of the last 5 weeks was absolutely crushing me. I finally broke down and sobbed, feeling absolutely defeated.  

I pulled it together. I was in sweatpants, a T-shirt, had gross hair in a bun and a tear stained face. I went in to visit Riley. Upon arriving, our nurse, an Orestad family friend who we had went trick or treating with the Halloween prior, asked me if I wanted to take Riley home today. They decided to do a car seat test but in a car bed. She had passed it but it was in a car bed made for slightly bigger babies, we would have to re do it in a tiny car bed. Enthusiastically, I said yes. 

Riley stayed in that car bed like a champ. 90 minutes later, they had the discharge papers ready for me. I got my car, pulled around and Amanda helped load Riley and her car bed into my car. It was pouring down rain. I looked like a hot mess and was alone. In my head, this moment was going to be beautiful and perfect, of course, it was real life. 

I drove Miss Riley home. Home, to be greeted by her brother, who instantly loved her. Home, where she can be with me and her dad whenever she needs us. Home ♥️ 

We are lucky. Lucky it was only a month. Lucky we were in the hospital getting monitored that night. Lucky she didn’t have any major health problems. Lucky she is already released from her therapies. Lucky she’s a healthy, amazing girl. Lucky we had the team we had and met the people we did. It might have only been a month but it was a month that fundamentally changed me as a person and for that I am not only lucky but blessed.",38,4,2021-09-12,stress during pregnancy

Cross posted from r/pregnancy as well. Please don’t repost. 


I had my scheduled c-section Wednesday morning , with time of birth at 07:01 cst. It was rushed because LO had no variability in his heart rate. Nurse and OB used their non-alarmist way of saying “LO needs to come out!” by saying, “Well, you’re having a baby this morning.” It was Deja Vú to my first born’s delivery. 


I was quickly prepped for the c-section and before I knew it LO was out. But he didn’t cry. His cord was abnormally thin and tightly wrapped around his ankle. LO’s doctor and my OB’s colleague were tending to him and were telling me that LO had pooped in uterine and they were concerned about his oxygen levels. The cord blood was measuring a bit too acidic. LO was rushed over to the nursery for more tests and a better evaluation while I was closed up. 


Once we were back in the recovery room, LO’s doctor came in and gave us an update. LO was going to be medivacced to Oklahoma University’s Children’s Hospital and going into the NICU. It’s better staffed and has all the proper equipment and specialists for LO. As more labs and tests were done on LO we were told that his O2 stats were too low and white blood cell count was too high. After testing his cord they determined that LO had suffered some sort of injury in the last 48 hours that effected the amount of oxygen going to his brain and there was damage. They’re giving LO 3 days of a cooling procedure to help with any inflammation and to prevent any further injury as well as treating him with antibiotics to address any infection he may have. He’ll more than likely be in the NICU for a week or more. 


My OB is considered one of the best in the state and is very highly respected in her field. For all her experience, she doesn’t know what could have caused the initial injury. LO had been moving just fine,  even last night. The only change in anything was that yesterday I was so tired that I was constantly dozing off while sitting on the couch, as well as being unable to sleep Sunday and Monday night due to what I had assumed was nesting. When she came up to me and touched me on the shoulder, I 100% expected her to tell me LO had died/was brain dead. LO’s doctor is also very stoic and even hurt by his condition. My doctor is convinced had I come in even just a day later I’d have had a stillbirth.


I can’t help but feel ashamed that I did something to cause this. That my own stubbornness and nesting urges have caused so much hurt in my family. There are 4 sets of grandparents and they’re all emotional wrecks. My dad doesn’t cry, I’m 35 and have seen the man cry one other time. I could hear him choking up and stumbling when I spoke with him. I’ll never forget that sound for the rest of my life. I’m not letting myself process this emotionally because I have to keep myself ready to hear the worst news, that this brain damage is severe and he’ll never recover. That he’s a vegetable on life support. I had my tubes tied before I was stitched up and now I’ve made a huge mistake. That this is my punishment for the 5 or 6 bowls of pot I smoked during the pregnancy on days my anxiety felt like a heart attack. And the worst: that I don’t deserve him and it’s for the best...

I never heard him cry. I hope all you other Covid-19 mommas will give your LO’s a big hug for me. Their crying maybe the most stressful thing you ever experience, and when you’re over it, try to remember what that crying truly means.",35,8,2020-04-24,stress during pregnancy

NICUParents,Medicaid as 2nd insurance based on Very Low Birth Weight advice,"I have read most of the posts in this sub and I want to thank you for educating me more than doctors and nurses through this difficult journey.
My baby was born at 26+3 weeks less than 1 kg and is 36 weeks now. Progress is minimal and we have private insurance (not through employer) but it does not include a couple of hospitals that can take better care. I am being told that my baby can qualify for Medicaid as a secondary insurance, but my NICU social worker believes it is income based which we do not qualify for. I am trying to figure it out on the Medicaid website but I see that it is income based and there is no option to qualify him based on Very Low Birth Weight. Can anyone please help me with any advice based on your experience.
Thanks

UPDATE:

We did ask our hospital staff.  They said that they don’t know how to proceed in this case. They do not have many babies born with very low birth weight in here and they haven’t filed any application with medicaid for this reason. 
They are not being helpful at all. I am trying to find out by myself. Called SSI and left an appointment for next month. Called Medicaid they refuse to accept an application for a low birth weight.

Extra calories have been added to breast milk and they are now switching from continuous feeds to bolus to see if that helps.

I feel upset and jealous it is getting harder to be around them and pretend to be happy and excited for them. I am tired of seeing their pictures in group messages. They dont see i am sad or depressed because probably to them, my babies are probably coming home within a couple of weeks with no really health issues. I see their kids getting all cuddles, pampered at home, gaining so much weight. I feel so sad for my babies. I am not able to spend too much time with them as i have other kids at home.

NICUParents,Insensitive comments,"My little boy was born at 30w0d and just turned a week old. He’s doing amazing and just has a feeding tube and monitors now. He’s breathing on his own and is back up to birth weight! 🎉 He’s been drinking my milk exclusively and my supply has been amazing for him!

Several people have asked me how often I go see him and they make comments like “Oh I’d be up there all the time”. It makes me feel like I’m not a good mother because I only go see him twice a day. Also, sometimes when we go see him, he’s all swaddled up sleeping and I don’t want to wake him just so I can selfishly hold him.

Additionally, I work from home and we had recently moved when my water broke, so I have been working, pumping, and setting up his nursery. It’s just not logistically possible to stay with him all day.

NICUParents,"35 week preemie. Otherwise healthy, but hardly 30ml per feed.","Hey.

Our baby was delivered at 35 weeks. He is 10 day old now.

In NICU he did great, they only kept him there for 2 days, we insisted on another 2 day stay actually. 

Since being discharged, he hasn't really been feeding well. He""ll take 25-30ml on a good session. Some times he will throw up, some times he will sleep off, sometimes he wont wake up. It is frustrating because the clinic recommends 45-60ml per session. 

His birth weight was 2.25kg and he is now at 2.15kg. 

We are using Dr Brown Premie Nipple. We tried the L1 nipple but felt like he was spitting too much on that

NICUParents,Little different experience | term baby in NICU,"My guy was born at 39+6 and weighed 9lbs 4oz. I almost feel silly posting here because so many of his NICU mates are less than half his birth weight when they graduate.

But he’s now on day 4 and will be there at least another 3 days but probably longer. Initially doctors thought he has transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) because of his fast breathing and desaturations. We thought we were looking at 3 days in the NICU but once he was off oxygen, he kept having cluster desats. Doctors say his breathing looks healthy so now they’re worried about his heart and/or lungs not transferring the oxygen to his blood. He’s also struggling keeping his bilirubin down despite being under the blue UV lights and supplementing with formula after his time at the breast and his pumped breast milk. 

Not knowing what’s going on is so difficult for me. I’ve also been staying with him while my husband is with our daughter (my parents are also watching her at times so we can see our son together). We feel like we have a son when we’re with him and then we feel like we have a daughter when we see her, but we don’t feel like we have two children.

NICUParents,Update: pre-eclampsia and di di twins,"
Update: we had a bad day and Charlotte is now transferred to a level 3 nicu in another city. She is stable but needed non-invasive ventilator support and will continue to do so for longer than my current hospital allowed. Desmond also had a small setback and is on cpap now, but he is doing well despite that. He is almost back up to his birth weight and he is so strong for being a tiny little guy. They joke that he's planning on turning around the assumption that girls just do better because he is really killing it. If the other nicu has an open bed that isn't needed urgently they are willing to take him to reunite them. 

Meanwhile, my brain is clear of the magnesium finally and I can tell I am a bit disassociated. It's hard to feel connected to my babies because of the trauma combined with the nicu stay. The magnesium made me disconnected from the birth in such a way that I don't feel like their mom in the same way I do with my other full term babies. I will be seeing my therapist on the 22nd and hopefully I can begin processing it and I'll be tellingly my doctor I am at much higher risk for ppd for all the obvious reasons. I will likely make a new post in a few days after being released to try and continue processing and dealing with all this. I know you all understand but even with all the reading abd preparing I did, I absolutely could not fully prepare myself for how hard this was going to be or how many emotions would flow through me. I can't wait to be out of the woods. 

I posted a couple days ago looking for some resources and advice while awaiting my scheduled c-section coming up on Monday and everyone was extremely helpful. As it turns out, my pre-eclampsia took a turn for the worst and my twins had to be delivered today at 33+4 at 5:51 and 5:53pm, respectively.

Twin a, my little girl named Charlotte Alice, came out weighing 4lbs 11 oz, 17 inches long. Twin b, Desmond Westley weighed 3 lbs 11 oz and was 16 inches long.

Both twins were put on oxygen at first and then intubated briefly for surfactant. They are now on room air with stable blood sugar and are doing well. Neither of us can hold them yet and I will likely have to wait until I am off magnesium at 6pm tomorrow before I am able to even go in there, but my husband was able to go see them and take videos for me.

We are off to a good start and I appreciate all the tips I got from here to prepare me.

NICUParents,We had an appointment today with the neonatologist at our NICU. Our baby has severe IUGR due to placental insufficiency. I thought I would share the questions we asked and the answers we were given incase it may help anyone else who is here preparing for a possible NICU stay.,"1. Gestational age VS gestational weight? Which is better as far as prognosis.

A: Gestational age is better, but low weight makes it more challenging. She doesn’t expect him to gain much more weight but she doesn’t really know. She has seen babies as small as 1 pound survive, she’s been a NICU doctor for 26 years. 

2. What would be a good goal weight/age to get to for the best prognosis?

A: A pound or a little more would be better than under a pound. 


3. What can we expect as far as ventilation, feedings, oxygen support, time in NICU, etc..?

A: Baby will likely need ventilation support, feedings will start very small and he will get a few drops of breast milk, if the feedings aren’t working they will switch him to intravenous feedings. Time in NICU will depend on how he is growing and any issues that arise and how well his lungs develop. 

4. What types of items would we need and which are provided? Clothes, formula, breast pumps, diapers, wipes? 

A: everything is provided, we can bring clothes when he gets a little bigger.

5. Are NICU babies in their own room like in an ICU or are they in a grouped area like in a nursery?

A: They are in pods of 3-4 babies

6. Are we allowed to stay? Are there visiting hours? Restrictions? 

A: Parents can visit 24/7, visitor restrictions due to Covid. 

7. If prognosis is very poor, he gets sicker than expected, and we feel complications will cause his quality of life to be very poor do we have the choice to end life saving measures in the NICU at any point? 

A: She was glad we asked this because it’s important to be realistic. They will do everything they can to help him but with any baby in the NICU there is a chance of something happening that would cause severe lifelong issues and poor quality of life, and if that happens then we as the parents have the right to end life saving measures. 

8. Are vaccines and the newborn screening for genetic issues such as sickle cell and cystic fibrosis still done on the same schedule as a full term baby? 

A: Vaccine schedule will be delayed but Newborn screening will occur on time, about 2-3 days after delivery.",81,22,2020-12-01,birth weight

NICUParents,Meconium in the lungs,"Our son was born 10 days ago (39w+1). He was born vaginally (epidural, 16 hour labor 4 hours of pushing) and was over 9lb birth weight but there was a lot of meconium during delivery. They told us this is common and after he was born he was crying and looked okay so we spent the first night and morning with him in our room. In the first night he spit up a large amount of meconium, which to my surprise the nurse on duty told us was not a concern and just cleaned him up, laid him back down and got him back to sleep. The next morning the doctor came in for a physical examination and noticed he had low blood oxygen saturation and irregular rapid short breathing so they moved him to the NICU where he was given oxygen via cannula at 1L 35%. Bacterial and viral cultures came back negative and after chest x-rays the doctors said he had fluid, likely meconium, in his lungs. Over the next few days his breathing rate came down to normal levels and he was weaned down to 21%. However, in the coming days he was unable to keep his saturation levels consistently above 94%, usually dipping when he was in deep sleep. We tried increasing to 1.5L and it seemed to work better as he shot up to consistently staying at 99-100% saturation. Feeding was always productive and he has always looked great in appearance. We were so excited that maybe he would be recovered and able to come home finally... But last night when we went in for his regular feeding the nurse told us his saturation dropped below 90 and heart rate was at 70 so they put a feeding tube in and bumped up his oxygen again. We were then told they would do another chest x-ray, which showed he still has hazy lungs likely still filled with meconium... They are running cultures and blood work on him which will take 5 days and we are just crushed at this news. The doctor tells us he may have pneumonia or some other kind of infection and will be here at least another week at least just to wait for test results. I am mostly upset that he was so clearly born with an abundance of meconium and spit it up that first night, saw x-ray with fluid in his lungs but 10 days later is when they finally decide to do these tests... It also seems the nurses all have a completely different understanding of meconium inhalation and are giving us inconsistent expectations and assessments on his outlook. We are absolutely crushed by this roller coaster as it seems like everytime he is looking like he is improving he comes back down and they extend our expected time in the NICU. I found this community in hopes I could get some reassurance or learn from other parents experiences dealing with this kind of condition. how long did it take for your baby to recover? Any help or knowledge on this condition that anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",29,17,2021-06-28,birth weight
NICUParents,"Delivery at 27 weeks, 2 days in NICU (warning: loss)","Hi everyone,

I've been a member of this sub ever since we learned our baby was certainly going to be delivered pre term.

This sub and all the contributions really gave me and my wife the important human experiences and stories, which supplemented the information and guidance provided by the doctors, midwives and nurses. 

This has been an enormous help to us, and I wanted to share our experiences so it may go on to help someone, and for a slightly selfish reason, so that the story of our baby boy's short life will live on and be preserved in the web.

This turned out to be a long one, but I've arranged into sections to help with the flow.

I will refrain from including a TLDR as I don't feel it to be appropriate for this topic, but my introduction above should suffice. 

&#x200B;

**Background:**

We (36M & 34F) live in the London area and have been trying to conceive for almost 3 years. It became difficult to see NHS doctors during the height of the pandemic, but fortunately we were able to seek help via the private route. We went though numerous tests (some very invasive for my wife, but she was brave) but there was never any diagnosis to explain our difficulty to conceive. We were also prescribed fertility drugs to help. On the verge of electing for IVF, we became pregnant via natual conception and we were overjoyed! At the time, it truly felt like the hard part was over. Our doctor prescribed Clexane injections and Aspirin tablets to reduce risk of blood clots, this was for a past condition unrelated to the pregnancy.

For a period of time (up to around the second trimester), things progressed well and we did all the typical things expectant parents do - gender reveal (it's a boy!), decide on names, shopping for baby clothes, and be shocked by the cost of some items (such as prams and cots!). We also transitioned care to the NHS as COVID restrictions were being relaxed.

&#x200B;

**Small baby:**

During the 20 week scan, it was revealed our baby was measuring small for his gestational age with some measurements under the 1st percentile. This was alarming and was the first sign something wasn't right. The sonographer and doctors explained this could be due to a number of reasons and they will observe the pregnancy more frequently, but that's all that could be done at that point. This was also the first time we were told a possible cause is pre-eclampsia. Determined to do all we could, we resorted to the private side again for a second opinion - we had our final private scan around the 24 week point and the sonographer advised us to go straight to hospital as she was seeing signs the baby wasn't doing well (small measurements, little movement, though heart rate was good).

&#x200B;

**Hospitals:**

The next morning we attended our nominated hospital and were shocked to learn we needed to deliver within the next 24 hours. Their latest scan showed no positive blood flow between placenta and baby, and mum's blood pressure was through the roof - all effects of pre-eclampsia. They administered magnesium sulphate to protect the baby's brain (to help reduce cerebral palsy) and steroids to help with the lungs. Our hospital also informed us their facilities were not equipped to care for extremely premature babies and we will need to transfer to another via ambulance - they eventually found a bed for us at Kings College Hospital.

It is difficult to convey the emotions in words, but we felt devastated. The doctors explained a 24 week baby was right on the cusp of viability, and the chances of survival were 40-50%, and those that do survive face another statistic of again 40-50% of developing long term conditions due to a premature birth. The odds were against us.

The 30 minute ambulance ride felt like an eternity when you realise these may be the last moments you will have with your little one.

&#x200B;

**Hope:**

After our arrival at Kings, the emotional rollercoaster takes a turn. Another scan revealed positive blood flow between baby and placenta! This was good news because our baby did not yet need to be delivered, allowing for more time for baby to develop. The flow was not great (lots of resistance) but good enough to be admitted to Kings until delivery. Mum was officially diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and kept under close observation. The aim was to treat 2 patients, mum and baby and to hang on as long as possible as each day bought us additional 3% survival rate. I am generalising but: Mum is treated for high blood pressure, to be kept low via tablets, and baby is monitored for positive blood flow (observed as intermittent) and general well being.

We lived day-to-day for the next 3 weeks, knowing the result of each scan or test may prompt us to deliver, but grateful for every day and every 3% we could give our little one. 28 weeks was the milestone to aim for. We were also fortunate enough to be moved from a shared ward to a more private room, the midwives understood it was distressing for us to be amongst expectant mothers who were fortunate enough to have reached full term. Mum was given strict orders to relax but was difficult to achieve in practice - daily scans, blood tests, injections and tablets every few hours (even the middle of the night) takes its toll. It was so painful to see my wife deteriorate so rapidly. She entered the hospital as an abled person with no perceptible symptoms, to someone who couldn't walk without help - a mix of symptoms as the result of pre-eclampsia, medication, and pregnancy (swollen feet and legs, easily out of breath, headaches, chest pains - and that is just the physical symptoms). She was in so much pain and discomfort, but she was so brave and selfless to endure and persevere - all to give the best chance to our son.

&#x200B;

**Birth and NICU:**

During the 27th week, mum woke up to bleeding and we were rushed to delivery.

The final scan showed the baby started to have difficulties and they suspected the placenta began to detach. An emergency C-section was the best option, mum was put under general aesthetic (due to the medication) and I wanted outside of the operating theatre.

Our son was delivered at 27th weeks gestational age, weighing just 630grams (\~1lb 6oz), he was rushed into NICU immediately.

I am told both mum and baby were doing well - I was so happy the delivery went smoothly for this to be the first thing my wife hears when she wakes up.

Later that evening, when mum recovered from the general aesthetic and able to receive pain relief, we went to visit our boy in NICU. They do not prepare you for how overwhelming the ward is - so many babies and so many beeps, alarms and chimes. After a moment, we tuned through the noise and fully focused on our boy. We were both relieved to see he was handling his first few hours so well, seeing him move his limbs and chest - it almost made us forget we are only partway through the journey. We were pleased to see a blood oxygen figure hovering around 90%, and we even talked about preparing for him to come home.

Mum's body was knackered and needed to recover, but we went to NICU as many times as we could. The ward is 24hrs access for parents and everyone was very accommodating. 

The doctors kept us up to date with our son's status, the positive and negative. We did not sleep much on day 1, and the bad news started to come on day 2 - they let us know our son was having trouble with his transition from womb to the world. The development of his lungs were on par with a 24 week old and were not mature enough to function as needed, even with help of 100% oxygen. We stayed at NICU as long as we could and the doctors and nurses did all they could, but that evening they let us know it was time. Our boy was so sick he was not going to make it past the night. So much happened in the past 48 hours, we were not prepared for this even though we always understood this was a possible outcome. We were assured all that could be done, had been done. 

This whole entire situation was caused by a moment further back in time which prevented the placenta from developing correctly, thus not allowing our boy to get the necessary energy and nutrition to grow. The usual treatment for this would have been Clexane and aspirin, but we were already on this from day 1 of our pregnancy.

&#x200B;

**Passing:**

The NICU team moved the 3 of us to a private isolation room, to allow us to hold our boy and be with him in his final moments.

There isn't much to elaborate here, except we held him in our arms whilst he passed.

We are truly grateful to be have been able to meet our son in the real world, albeit for 2 days, and to be thankful he did not pass alone and were able to say our goodbyes.

The funeral would be held 2 weeks after.

The hospital bereavement team does reach out to check up on us and offer advice and help. I really appreciate this, but there are many things which we could not prepare for. It was so heart breaking and harrowing to hear my wife waking up during the night, clutch her tummy and for a second forget about our loss, only to relive it all over again when her mind catches up. She wanted to believe it was all a dream.

At the time of writing, it is almost 3 weeks after our boy went to sleep. There is an enormous sense of loss and emptiness - the feeling that the past 3 years of trying to conceive and bearing with all the pain endured during pregnancy all went to waste. No plans for the baby stuff already bought or gifted to us, they just sit here taking up space, and the half decorated baby room feels like limbo. The inevitably difficulty of living through future birthdays and seeing friends going through their pregnancies and raising their children.

&#x200B;

**Acknowledgements**:

It is easy to visualise this story revolving around 3 people, but the reality is this story features many, many others. Our family and friends would always win the best supporting roles - but I'd like to mention we received an immeasurable level of support from the countless nurses, doctors and midwives that helped us through it all.

&#x200B;

* The Kings Blood Pressure team - their professionalism and expertise contributed to the extra time we got with our boy, to give him the best possible outcome and making sure mum stays healthy. It was also essential for us to know we had a consistent team of people looking after us, allowing us to become familiar names and faces.
* The neonatal team and maternity wards - the midwives, nurses and health care professionals that were dedicated to our day-to-day comfort, measuring blood pressure, drawing blood, and also important - giving the NHS a human face with their distinct personalities and touch. We thank them for their compassion.
* The NICU team - this must be such a difficult job, to juggle so many fragile little babies, staying calm under pressure and knowing exactly what to do. It is easy to forget that nurses and doctors are just human, and can't help but to be affected by the loss of any baby they cared for. We are so thankful they were able to be so compassionate during our boy's passing. They removed all medical devices and equipment from our son, and helped us bathe and dress him.
* 4 Louis - this is a charity targeted at parents of stillbirth and loss. We were provided with baby clothes, toys and hand print kits. We are so thankful this was available, as it allowed us to have some 'normal' moments and memories with our boy.
* Funeral directors - Our funeral director did a wonderful job. We did not realise the industry does not charge for babies or children, which moved us very much. The hospital explained the government created a fund to help pay for such arrangements for children, but we later found out much of the funeral industry did not charge even prior to the fund, and many don't claim from the government. My only regret here is I wish to retain anonymity and cannot name our local firm - but send me a message if you are in the London South East and want to know.

&#x200B;

**Closing:**

This clearly was not a story with a happy ending - but I think there were happy moments at certain points of our journey. We realise there are those who have been more fortunate than us, and those whose stories have been more tragic. We hope our story provides further insight to these difficult processes, to be used to help and to inform. I am not able to go into detail on every aspect, otherwise this post would become a book - but please reach out if you have any questions or comments.

Thank you for reading.",125,48,2021-10-31,gestational age
NICUParents,Mourning pregnancy?,"My twins were born at 29 + 3 and I was actually really enjoying being pregnant. They’re 33 weeks gestational age now, and I keep thinking about how I should still be pregnant, and never will get to really experience third trimester.

I’m so thankful that they’re doing well and that what I’m sad about is pretty silly compared to healthy babies, but I’m mourning my pregnancy cut short. I never got very big, they’d only just started moving to where I could really feel it, and I don’t have any pictures of me pregnant. We won’t be having any more kids, so this was my one and only time being pregnant. 

Does anyone else feel a bit sad about their missed pregnancy experiences?",65,44,2021-11-08,gestational age

NICUParents,Delivery at 34 weeks,"Hi everyone. Currently pregnant with twins And was recently diagnosed with preeclampsia at 33 weeks. I have been hospitalized with the plan to deliver at 34 weeks. Does anyone have any NICU survival tips? Also, for people who gave birth around this gestational age, how long was your baby/babies in the NICU for? I’m excited to meet them but I’m dreading the NICU experience.",19,27,2021-12-19,gestational age
NICUParents,We had an appointment today with the neonatologist at our NICU. Our baby has severe IUGR due to placental insufficiency. I thought I would share the questions we asked and the answers we were given incase it may help anyone else who is here preparing for a possible NICU stay.,"1. Gestational age VS gestational weight? Which is better as far as prognosis.

A: Gestational age is better, but low weight makes it more challenging. She doesn’t expect him to gain much more weight but she doesn’t really know. She has seen babies as small as 1 pound survive, she’s been a NICU doctor for 26 years. 

2. What would be a good goal weight/age to get to for the best prognosis?

A: A pound or a little more would be better than under a pound. 


3. What can we expect as far as ventilation, feedings, oxygen support, time in NICU, etc..?

A: Baby will likely need ventilation support, feedings will start very small and he will get a few drops of breast milk, if the feedings aren’t working they will switch him to intravenous feedings. Time in NICU will depend on how he is growing and any issues that arise and how well his lungs develop. 

4. What types of items would we need and which are provided? Clothes, formula, breast pumps, diapers, wipes? 

A: everything is provided, we can bring clothes when he gets a little bigger.

5. Are NICU babies in their own room like in an ICU or are they in a grouped area like in a nursery?

A: They are in pods of 3-4 babies

6. Are we allowed to stay? Are there visiting hours? Restrictions? 

A: Parents can visit 24/7, visitor restrictions due to Covid. 

7. If prognosis is very poor, he gets sicker than expected, and we feel complications will cause his quality of life to be very poor do we have the choice to end life saving measures in the NICU at any point? 

A: She was glad we asked this because it’s important to be realistic. They will do everything they can to help him but with any baby in the NICU there is a chance of something happening that would cause severe lifelong issues and poor quality of life, and if that happens then we as the parents have the right to end life saving measures. 

8. Are vaccines and the newborn screening for genetic issues such as sickle cell and cystic fibrosis still done on the same schedule as a full term baby? 

A: Vaccine schedule will be delayed but Newborn screening will occur on time, about 2-3 days after delivery.",83,22,2020-12-01,gestational age
NICUParents,"""Not medically necessary""","So we've hit a thing with the insurance company, and I'm wondering if anyone else has been through this:

We got a letter from my wife's insurance (who our son is currently under) for the first few days of his (ongoing) NICU stay. The letter informed us that because the hospital hadn't sent treatment information over, and he was ""larger than 1000 grams and more than 28 weeks gestational age"", their staff doctor determined a NICU stay was ""not medically necessary"" and they wouldn't be covering it.

We'll be sorting out the treatment list thing with the hospital, but has anyone else run into this with their insurances?

*update: spoke to the hospital admin, who spoke to the insurance company who approved him for at least the first week; we suspect they'll approve it throughout his stay. Thanks for the responses!",38,24,2021-04-24,gestational age
NICUParents,Folks discharged with oxygen- tell me your story/experience,"So, we’ve been home for about a month!!! 

When we were discharged, they said our LO would probably need the oxygen for about 3 weeks. However, we were never given a concrete answer as to why she was still needing oxygen.

We’ve now started working with a pulmonologist to identify the cause and attempt to ween her off of it. The current pulmonologist things that it is most likely due to being a little premature. However, if weening fails, we could be looking at possibly a rare genetic mutation… which would be devastating. 

My questions for those of you who have been or were discharged with oxygen:

What reason was given for the persistent need for oxygen? How long was your LO on it? What was your LO’s gestational age at birth?",17,17,2021-07-31,gestational age
NICUParents,Adjusted ages,"How do you personally tell other people your babies ages? Actual?, adjusted?, both ages?

Mine (twins) were born 7 weeks early, so now at 3 weeks past their due date, they look just like 3 weeks old (size wise) and laughably not at all like almost 2 months old. If I were to tell another parent of a 2 month old that they are 2 months, I'm sure they'd be very confused. However, my pediatrician just gave them the 2 month screener questions, and they did pretty well. 

How much of the babies age is made up of development outside of the womb (like now breathing air) and how much is gestational age (like now being 9 pounds instead of 3)?

EDIT: Thank you all for chiming in! I'm seeing a few different ways to go about this until they catch up, and that it really can depend on the parents and the given situation.",25,19,2021-04-04,gestational age
NICUParents,Daycare for a late preemie,"Hello! I’m currently 34 weeks pregnant and am going to have a csection at 35 weeks and 1 day due to vasa previa. Im not sure if my son will be in NICU or not, I’ve been getting steroid shots for his lung development, ultrasounds have shown him being ahead of gestation age and 80th percentile for weight. 

My question is my maternity leave is only 6 months, so when I go back to work he’ll be about 5 months adjusted. It would be during the spring so he wouldn’t have a risk of RSV or flu. But I’m horrified of something happening if he goes into daycare too soon.

What’s your experiences with daycare? We live in a different state than any of our family, so that’s not an option. We thought about a nanny or a daytime babysitter but I’m scared of something bad happening.",5,14,2021-10-28,gestational age
NICUParents,Feeling alone,"My baby girl is currently 2.5 weeks old (29 weeks gestational age). I was told when she switched to a bubble vent I would finally be able to hold her.

Haven’t gone to see her yet today because I know I can’t handle seeing other moms hold their babies. 
Just needed to vent a little to someone who understands how I feel.


Update: Thanks to an amazing NICU nurse I was able to hold her today. She basically told the doctor there was no reason not to KC and that we were doing it. 
It was an absolutely amazing moment that I will never forget.

NICUParents,"3 weeks in the NICU, born at 28+3. Worried about growth trajectory","My son was born through spontaneous preterm labor 3 weeks ago on 8/26 at 28+3.  He's very healthy as far as being premature goes, and was at 2 lb 9 oz when and 15 inches when he was born.  He finally started climbing above his birth weight about 10 days in, and is now at 3 lb 1 oz, but is struggling with episodes of apnea.

&#x200B;

I am a bit concerned about his growth though - over the last 3 weeks he gets measured on length and head circumference every Sunday, but his head circumference has only gone up 1 cm from 26 to 27 cm, and his length has gone from 37 to 38 cm, which is still at 15 inches.

&#x200B;

I checked my pregnancy app and at his gestational age of 31 weeks, a typical fetus is nearly 17 inches and 3.75 lbs...  I know he has to lose weight when first born, but I'm just worried he's not growing much and when he will be able to catch up.  Does anyone have experience with this?  Or are NICU babies smaller than full term babies even at same adjusted age?  Do they only catch up when they become toddlers or later?",15,19,2020-09-17,gestational age
NICUParents,8 weeks into our NICU stay- need words of encouragement about feeding milestones,"FTM here. My baby was born at 30 weeks and 5 days.

Some days she does 60% PO and some 30% PO. The closer we get to the due date, the harder it has been for me. They are now talking about her anemia potentially being the issue for the reduced energy and stamina (they may transfuse if they see a big dip in a reading tomorrow) , and today they spoke about how many babies do go home with the gavage tube. It’s exhausting and i would love to hear from other NICU parents about their experiences on this front. Sorry for the verbal diarrhea. Really want her to be healthy and come home soon.",13,19,2020-06-25,gestational age
NICUParents,Update on our baby,"I posted awhile ago. My baby was born at 25w 1d and is now 33 weeks gestational age or one day from being 8 weeks actual. She was born at 790 g and is now constantly teetering around 1400grams. Her growth is in the 11th percentile and we started her on sodium and MCT oil to help weight gain. She had a staph infection in her blood her first week. Beat it!

Now we have a large PDA and she's fluid restricted and having trouble gaining or keeping weight. She did have a ton of bad desats but we did surgery for PDA closure with catheter. It kept popping off as her PDA is stretchy. So we wait until she's 6lb and do another catheter procedure with a standard size then or she has to have open chest surgery.

Well for the last 4 days since unsuccessful surgery she has done phenomenal. We took her rate off CPAP. Went down on her peep. Mostly at 21 fiO2 and very few desats at all. Until last night. Now she's having several an hour and had one go to 20% O2 and the rest 50-60s. May to back up on her rate. If it continues we may have to consider open chest surgery.

She also had BPD and ASD. And discovered some eye disease in her left eye. 

She's doing pretty well all things considered. But in really stressed. I can't be with her as much as I want due to having dogs at home and hubby works full time. Anyway. That's our update.",51,6,2021-05-25,gestational age
NICUParents,"At what age can I expect my baby to become more alert, awake, and responsive to his surroundings? Is this typical?","My baby was born at 28+4 weeks via emergency c-section due to severe early onset intrauterine growth restriction after heart decelerations were detected on the fetal monitor. He came out weighing 1lb 0.2oz and was 10 inches long. It was a placental issue, all chromosomal issues were ruled out. So far he’s had a few issues with his blood work, some jaundice, and had to be intubated for the first few days on low vent settings and low oxygen requirements. He has a PDA and some brady events where he desats but he recovers quickly with stimulation. Blood gases look good, no brain bleeds, no infections, and is gaining weight despite not quite tolerating full feeds yet and only his trophic feedings so far. 

My question is at what age did your baby finally become more alert and aware of your presence? My little guy is 3 weeks old today (almost 32 weeks CGA) and it seems like he just sleeps all the time. Even when he wakes up he opens his eyes and looks at me but doesn’t seem to acknowledge I’m there and it’s hard to even tell if he’s awake or just opening his eyes in his sleep. 

My other son was born at 37 weeks and came out very alert and wide awake, so only a 5 week age difference. 

Is this normal for micro preemie babies or could this be a sign that he has some degree of cognitive issues? When can I expect him to be more aware and acknowledge my presence? At what corrected gestational age did your baby cry regularly and want to be held?",6,11,2020-12-30,gestational age
NICUParents,Appropriate growth curves?,"What growth curves did your pediatrician follow after you left the NICU? Our pediatrician was tracking our 26 weeker on a normal full term baby curve based on his adjusted age and he was doing fine. Then today she showed us a different curve, one that is specific to premature babies born at various completed gestational months and his percentiles have suddenly increased. Basically the difference between the two is that this one tracks him against other preterm male babies. Technically he should be on a curve that starts at -3 months (born 3 months before due date), but the one she had started at -2 months. Presumably this curve merges with the full term baby curve at some point?",21,13,2020-06-08,gestational age
NICUParents,Advise pls - bringing bb home,"Hi everyone,

I realized last night (or rather at 4:30am this morning) that I have no idea what to do when we finally bring our little one home. She was born at 29w3 and very fortunately has had a very uneventful NICU stay over the last 31 days. We still have the feeding hurdle to overcome and the nasal cannula (at 21%), but it does seem that the end is nigh-ish. We are finally trying protective breastfeeding tomorrow at 34 weeks gestationally.

To that point, do you have any resources or recommendations in terms of sleep and pump scheduling, general 'newborn' advice or anything else? I'm finding it difficult to know how to apply things like nap schedules etc. directed at your full term babies, but also, she doesn't appear to need severe intervention when she busts free. I'm hoping for advice that takes into account her gestational age since she was born pretty early (but not super micro).

My ideal is something flexible that also allows for sleep as I'm a literal crazy person on minimal sleep. I also don't know what I don't know -- do preemies have general issues we should be aware of (difficult to do activities, etc.)?

Thank you!

Ps. I know all babies are different, I just am overwhelmed with where to start.",8,7,2021-06-04,gestational age
NICUParents,Baby in for a long stay at hospital,"Writing from a phone and I don't know how to work Reddit properly.
My baby girl was born at gestation age, 31+3, after a suspected infection in my womb, via emergency c section, turns out my placenta was in absolute shit. I PPROM'd (preterm rupture of the membranes, lost my amniotic fluid) at 17+ 4 weeks, and we expected lung issues and an early delivery anyway but she came out perfect. 
It was discovered a few hours later she has a heart defect. Which ironically had nothing to do with the PPROM after all our worrying. Basically, two of our main arteries, one brings oxygen to the body, one brings oxygen to the lungs, both of her arteries are only bringing oxygen to the body. (I may have explains the artery bit wrong but that's the overall explanation) So once she's weighing heavier, hopefully 6 weeks time, she'll be getting a stint in her heart and then major heart surgery at 6 months old. 

Has anyone had a baby with a long stay in hospital? How do I cope? The hospital is 3 hours away from where I live, so I have sorted accomodation and packed for a stay of 6 weeks first, ready for her first surgery.
But I'm just worried about her development, not being able to cater to her needs, how the next few months are going to be.",14,5,2021-06-26,gestational age
NICUParents,Twins scheduled for graduation tomorrow!,"Wanted to put a post out there to give others hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  We have been in the NICU between two different hospitals for 90 days and we are on track for discharge tomorrow!! Our girls were born at 28 and 4 on June 11th after pprom and unexpected delivery of twin A plus major complications for both girls.

We have gone through the ringer of doctors believing one kid didn’t make surfactin and had some crazy rare disease to needing three different ventilators and effectively 24w lung development with one twin (didn’t end up being the disease just very very underdeveloped). The other had a misplaced picc line that led to a pleural effusion around her heart and a cardiac episode resulting in an emergency transport to a higher level NICU.  We have seen a lot and our girls are fighters.  They have been learning to eat and grow over the last month and are finally headed home at 7.7lbs and 6.7lbs at 41 and 2 weeks gestational age and 90 days in the NICU.

For those just beginning their families journey or those in the thick of it, it gets better. The nurses, doctors and staff at the NICU are the best at what they do and your baby(s) are in the right place.  Thank you for those who responded to my initial post when we didn’t know which way is up.

I'm just feeling a little blindsided and lost, just wondering if this community has any advice for a NICU stay at this gestational age?

NICUParents,Developmental Delays,"I know this is going to be a long post, so I apologize in advance. I'm just desperate for advice so I want to give as much info as possible.

Just to start, when I found out I was pregnant, I was living 2000 miles from my nearest family and I was alone. I had very little knowledge on how a pregnancy was supposed to go, so I just made an appointment with a local OBGYN who took my insurance and figured I was set. Now, after learning from my mom friends and getting a new OBGYN, I have realized he was truly a quack. He was a real doctor but I guess believed in a more holistic 'let things be' approach. Other than confirming pregnancy, he never actually ran any tests on me. He never took my blood or urine at any appointments. I say this to explain that I had very little prenatal care.

My first sign that anything was wrong with my pregnancy was at 27 weeks. I had been swelling something awful for a few weeks, but on that particular day something felt off so I went to the hospital. They said I was in active labor. They were able to stop the labor and sent me home, telling me to follow up with my doctor. I called him, but he just said that I was probably dehydrated and to keep my regular appointments.

By 33 weeks the swelling was getting unbearable. I was swollen so bad up my thighs that I could press hand prints into them. I was also feeling sick and headachy all the time. At 33+3, I was eating dinner when I PPROM'd. I panicked, of course, and went to the hospital. They basically said there's no fixing it and I was having my baby. They were able to delay labor with magnesium long enough for me to get steroid shots for the baby's lungs. My doctor showed up for my last two pushes, then left. I never saw him again. I had my daughter on Christmas day 2019. She was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen, but they took her away right away for the NICU.

Thankfully, my daughter was a fighter. She was having difficulty breathing, was jaundice, and, of course, couldn't eat on her own. At this time I also had a meeting with a hospital doctor since my OB bailed. He told me I had untreated preeclampsia and hyperthyroidism which is likely why my daughter came early. My daughter spent a rough month in the NICU, but was eventually released with a clean bill of health. We moved back to be near family and its been a joy to have her every single day.

This brings me to now. My daughter is 13 months old actual and nearly 18 lbs but I am concerned about her development. She has been late on every one of her milestones which I understand is normal for preemies, but I don't know if it's all normal.

To start, she began sitting up on her own around 10 months actual. She is still unable to get herself into the sitting position, but will sit if I put her there. She cannot crawl. If I put her on her belly she just screams, cries, and flails until I pick her up. That being said, she will scoot around on her butt. She babbles but she has no words. She mostly recognizes her name, but she obviously does not understand anything I say, even just 'no.' Finally, eating is a battle with her. She loves her bottle. She drinks about 4 oz every 4 hours of neosure. She does not hold her own bottle and is unable to drink from a sippy cup or straw. She also will not eat solid food. I'm lucky if I get one meal of 2 tbsp baby rice and and 2 tbsp of puree into her. She will not eat anything with chunks or texture at all. Even if I get it into her mouth, she'll just gag, cry, and spit it out.

I have approached her pediatrician with my concerns, but he keeps saying she's fine, that everything is attributable to her being a preemie, and that she'll catch up by 2. The thing is she wasn't that premature. I'm watching my friend's babies pass her by and I'm so worried that there's something wrong. Obviously with my track record with doctors, I'm wondering if I've made a bad choice again. Maybe her doctor is a quack too. Maybe he just doesn't know how to deal with preemies.

I'm just desperately looking for some advice and guidance. From other preemie parents perspectives, do her delays seem normal for her gestational age at birth? If not, what support should I be pursuing? Honestly, I don't even know enough to know what I should be asking here. Any advice is wanted and welcome. Thank you so much if you made it through this post and thank you in advance for your help.",4,8,2021-01-16,gestational age
NICUParents,Reflux tips,"Hello, my little girl was born at 32 and is now 36 gestational age. From talking to the nurses and reading posts on this sub I think she struggles with reflux. She’s spit up a few times, but mainly she gets hiccups, grunts, distended belly, arches her back, and has oxygen saturation dips. She gets fortified breast milk and will be on Neosure when discharged. But I’ve read posts on this sub that lead me to believe those can aggravate a babies stomach. The doctors haven’t told me to try any dietary changes for my breast milk (like cut out diary). The doctors and nurses aren’t that concerned with her symptoms, but I hate to see her uncomfortable. Any tips for reducing reflux in the NICU and when she’s home?

I keep her upright for 30 minutes after feedings when I am there. The nurses put her bed up at an angle. They have advised against an angled pillow after discharge because of SIDS risk.",8,5,2020-11-17,gestational age
NICUParents,Cardiac surgery and feeding issues,"I know I post way too much here by now but I have a few feeding questions and any input would be greatly appreciated. I have a 43 week old (born at 39 weeks so technically not a preemie but small for gestational age) who recently had heart surgery a little over 3 weeks back. He has taken a good amount of formula and donor milk through a bottle before surgery but now he takes 99% of his feeds through the ng tube. I call and ask every day how his feeds are progressing but I have the feeling its just easier for the nurses to leave him on the ng feeds then it is to work with a fussy baby to take his feeds through a bottle but that really, really scares me because while he has made some progress in his feeding so far (he didn't used to be able to take bolus feeds but now he keeps them down) I'm worried I might have to take him home with either the ng tube or a gtube.

Its hard for me to be there for him because me and my husband share a car and he works most of the day but I'm going to try and stay longer to supervise his feeding and try the bottle feeding myself (He only takes just under 10 mls sadly) because I'm more willing to work through his fussiness because he's my child and I'm his only real advocate. I can't stand the thought of him lying there with an ng tube damaging his intestines knowing that if I were there maybe he would eat more. Every time I've held him so far he seemed to move closer to my breast, I know his ability to suck and swallow is there and I've even seen drink a bottle before with no issue. Can anyone give me advice on what to do? Techniques to try? What I should ask of the nurses? Will I have to accept the reality that he will need to come home with the tube?

&#x200B;

Am I allowed to try a bottle feed myself and will the nurses generally be ok with this or do they have a routine they never stray from and I have to get lucky with being there at the right time?",3,5,2020-07-23,gestational age
NICUParents,Fortifier woes!,"Can anyone give me your tips for getting your baby to take fortified milk that they don’t like?

Some backstory:

My 28-weeker came home a few weeks ago. We were told to fortify half his feeds (so, 4 bottles a day) to 24 calories. He had some weight loss in the NICU from being on IVs during an episode of bloody stools, so he’s still gaining “catch up” weight.

He’s got a dairy allergy, so we’re using Elecare. He hates it. He doesn’t like the taste, it makes him horrifically gassy, his poops are watery and stress him to the point of giving him bloody stool. We tried Alimentum, and he didn’t like that either.

We did a trial run with just nursing for five days, and he was like a different baby. Less gas, settling at night. But, he didn’t gain enough - only 3 ounces in 5 days. The doctor wants him to jump weight percentiles to catch up on a weight loss he had while still in the NICU.

We’ve tried feeding him in a bouncer seat to distract him a little, which seems to work the best. Anything else is an hour of spluttering, choking, crying, spitting, to get down *maybe* 40mL. We were told to try for 60 at a minimum per fortified feeding, but he just shuts down and won’t do it. Even if he’s hungry.

Any suggestions/tips? Editing to add, his current gestational age is 43 weeks. So I think he’s a little too young to try something like oatmeal, although the doctor suggested I could do that in another month.",4,3,2020-07-01,gestational age
NICUParents,Has anyone been diagnosed with ptsd after their traumatic birth/NICU experience?,"If you're open to sharing, what did your symptoms look like, how did the diagnosis come about, what has treatment looked like and have things improved?",14,9,2020-09-08,birth experience
NICUParents,Feeding 27 weeker,"Hi all! I've commented in here but never actually posted but I'm starting to get really frustrated and wanted to see what others experiences have been like.

My boy was born back in October at 27+1. No pregnancy complications (but I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a month after, went into labor before my gestational test). He came suddenly and quick. Out of nowhere had very intense contractions, called 911 and was 7cm dilated when I got to the hospital, only an hour after contractions started. His heart kept dropping so they did an emergency c section and just over an hour later our boy was here at 3 lbs! He didn't cry and they whisked him away quickly. There was probably 50 people in the room for both me and him, so dad couldn't see what was going on. He got transferred to the main hospital to a level 4 NICU and I got transferred the next morning. 

Our NICU journey has been a lot of back and forth. Two steps forward, three steps back for sure. He was ventilated immediately after birth, went on biphasic cpap a few days later, went into respiratory failure and emergency intubated (I was at the hospital when this happened, worst thing in the world to witness). He was put on biphasic again a few days later but then his gases were dropping and they put him on nasal IMV which thankfully he took well too and didn't have to be intubated again. Then it was back and forth between biphasic and cpap for a couple weeks until finally he got to high flow nasal cannula at the beginning of December and now is on low flow nasal cannula. He's got a mild case of BPD and a moderate ASD. He had respiratory distress syndrome and apnea of prematurity and was our pod troublemaker always going apnic and making the nurses run in our room constantly. Thank goodness those days are done! 

We started working on feeding December 9th but it was a slow start. He had a lot of tests and vaccines and we moved to the transitional care unit the next week so he was exhausted. I spent a few days focusing on breastfeeding and was able to get him to latch but he doesn't feed, I think he just likes to comfort nurse. He had done bottles during his trial POs and did well so I didn't think it was going to be an issue bottle feeding. Now we've been working on bottle feeds for 1.5 weeks and it feels like we're barely making any progress. He's at 27% of his feeds done orally. He'll have a good feed and I think it's clicking but then the next feed it's like he can't find the bottle that is in his mouth and he forgot how to swallow and panics. He finished a whole bottle (although it took over an hour and four long breaks) with me yesterday but then the next feed wouldn't wake up and the one after was in a state of panic the whole time (but I still got him to take 40ml but it was a battle). 

Our due date is exactly two weeks away and they're still hopeful he'll be out by then but i dont see how when he's still struggling with feeding, still on oxygen, and still having bradies and desats. They stopped his caffeine last Monday and over the past couple days as it clears out of his system he's been having more bradies. He has to take 100% of his feeds orally, be completely off oxygen, and no events for five days to be released. I don't know how that is even possible in 14 days. I'm hoping to be out by January 22 bc that will be 100 days and I just can't go that long. 

They keep saying once feeding clicks, he'll just take off. Once he gets feeding they'll take him off oxygen (it's very very low). But every time I think it's clicking the next feed is a literal train wreck. So I'm curious what we're other preemies feeding journeys like?",16,70,2021-12-29,birth experience
NICUParents,"Delivery at 27 weeks, 2 days in NICU (warning: loss)","Hi everyone,

I've been a member of this sub ever since we learned our baby was certainly going to be delivered pre term.

This sub and all the contributions really gave me and my wife the important human experiences and stories, which supplemented the information and guidance provided by the doctors, midwives and nurses. 

This has been an enormous help to us, and I wanted to share our experiences so it may go on to help someone, and for a slightly selfish reason, so that the story of our baby boy's short life will live on and be preserved in the web.

This turned out to be a long one, but I've arranged into sections to help with the flow.

I will refrain from including a TLDR as I don't feel it to be appropriate for this topic, but my introduction above should suffice. 

&#x200B;

**Background:**

We (36M & 34F) live in the London area and have been trying to conceive for almost 3 years. It became difficult to see NHS doctors during the height of the pandemic, but fortunately we were able to seek help via the private route. We went though numerous tests (some very invasive for my wife, but she was brave) but there was never any diagnosis to explain our difficulty to conceive. We were also prescribed fertility drugs to help. On the verge of electing for IVF, we became pregnant via natual conception and we were overjoyed! At the time, it truly felt like the hard part was over. Our doctor prescribed Clexane injections and Aspirin tablets to reduce risk of blood clots, this was for a past condition unrelated to the pregnancy.

For a period of time (up to around the second trimester), things progressed well and we did all the typical things expectant parents do - gender reveal (it's a boy!), decide on names, shopping for baby clothes, and be shocked by the cost of some items (such as prams and cots!). We also transitioned care to the NHS as COVID restrictions were being relaxed.

&#x200B;

**Small baby:**

During the 20 week scan, it was revealed our baby was measuring small for his gestational age with some measurements under the 1st percentile. This was alarming and was the first sign something wasn't right. The sonographer and doctors explained this could be due to a number of reasons and they will observe the pregnancy more frequently, but that's all that could be done at that point. This was also the first time we were told a possible cause is pre-eclampsia. Determined to do all we could, we resorted to the private side again for a second opinion - we had our final private scan around the 24 week point and the sonographer advised us to go straight to hospital as she was seeing signs the baby wasn't doing well (small measurements, little movement, though heart rate was good).

&#x200B;

**Hospitals:**

The next morning we attended our nominated hospital and were shocked to learn we needed to deliver within the next 24 hours. Their latest scan showed no positive blood flow between placenta and baby, and mum's blood pressure was through the roof - all effects of pre-eclampsia. They administered magnesium sulphate to protect the baby's brain (to help reduce cerebral palsy) and steroids to help with the lungs. Our hospital also informed us their facilities were not equipped to care for extremely premature babies and we will need to transfer to another via ambulance - they eventually found a bed for us at Kings College Hospital.

It is difficult to convey the emotions in words, but we felt devastated. The doctors explained a 24 week baby was right on the cusp of viability, and the chances of survival were 40-50%, and those that do survive face another statistic of again 40-50% of developing long term conditions due to a premature birth. The odds were against us.

The 30 minute ambulance ride felt like an eternity when you realise these may be the last moments you will have with your little one.

&#x200B;

**Hope:**

After our arrival at Kings, the emotional rollercoaster takes a turn. Another scan revealed positive blood flow between baby and placenta! This was good news because our baby did not yet need to be delivered, allowing for more time for baby to develop. The flow was not great (lots of resistance) but good enough to be admitted to Kings until delivery. Mum was officially diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and kept under close observation. The aim was to treat 2 patients, mum and baby and to hang on as long as possible as each day bought us additional 3% survival rate. I am generalising but: Mum is treated for high blood pressure, to be kept low via tablets, and baby is monitored for positive blood flow (observed as intermittent) and general well being.

We lived day-to-day for the next 3 weeks, knowing the result of each scan or test may prompt us to deliver, but grateful for every day and every 3% we could give our little one. 28 weeks was the milestone to aim for. We were also fortunate enough to be moved from a shared ward to a more private room, the midwives understood it was distressing for us to be amongst expectant mothers who were fortunate enough to have reached full term. Mum was given strict orders to relax but was difficult to achieve in practice - daily scans, blood tests, injections and tablets every few hours (even the middle of the night) takes its toll. It was so painful to see my wife deteriorate so rapidly. She entered the hospital as an abled person with no perceptible symptoms, to someone who couldn't walk without help - a mix of symptoms as the result of pre-eclampsia, medication, and pregnancy (swollen feet and legs, easily out of breath, headaches, chest pains - and that is just the physical symptoms). She was in so much pain and discomfort, but she was so brave and selfless to endure and persevere - all to give the best chance to our son.

&#x200B;

**Birth and NICU:**

During the 27th week, mum woke up to bleeding and we were rushed to delivery.

The final scan showed the baby started to have difficulties and they suspected the placenta began to detach. An emergency C-section was the best option, mum was put under general aesthetic (due to the medication) and I wanted outside of the operating theatre.

Our son was delivered at 27th weeks gestational age, weighing just 630grams (\~1lb 6oz), he was rushed into NICU immediately.

I am told both mum and baby were doing well - I was so happy the delivery went smoothly for this to be the first thing my wife hears when she wakes up.

Later that evening, when mum recovered from the general aesthetic and able to receive pain relief, we went to visit our boy in NICU. They do not prepare you for how overwhelming the ward is - so many babies and so many beeps, alarms and chimes. After a moment, we tuned through the noise and fully focused on our boy. We were both relieved to see he was handling his first few hours so well, seeing him move his limbs and chest - it almost made us forget we are only partway through the journey. We were pleased to see a blood oxygen figure hovering around 90%, and we even talked about preparing for him to come home.

Mum's body was knackered and needed to recover, but we went to NICU as many times as we could. The ward is 24hrs access for parents and everyone was very accommodating. 

The doctors kept us up to date with our son's status, the positive and negative. We did not sleep much on day 1, and the bad news started to come on day 2 - they let us know our son was having trouble with his transition from womb to the world. The development of his lungs were on par with a 24 week old and were not mature enough to function as needed, even with help of 100% oxygen. We stayed at NICU as long as we could and the doctors and nurses did all they could, but that evening they let us know it was time. Our boy was so sick he was not going to make it past the night. So much happened in the past 48 hours, we were not prepared for this even though we always understood this was a possible outcome. We were assured all that could be done, had been done. 

This whole entire situation was caused by a moment further back in time which prevented the placenta from developing correctly, thus not allowing our boy to get the necessary energy and nutrition to grow. The usual treatment for this would have been Clexane and aspirin, but we were already on this from day 1 of our pregnancy.

&#x200B;

**Passing:**

The NICU team moved the 3 of us to a private isolation room, to allow us to hold our boy and be with him in his final moments.

There isn't much to elaborate here, except we held him in our arms whilst he passed.

We are truly grateful to be have been able to meet our son in the real world, albeit for 2 days, and to be thankful he did not pass alone and were able to say our goodbyes.

The funeral would be held 2 weeks after.

The hospital bereavement team does reach out to check up on us and offer advice and help. I really appreciate this, but there are many things which we could not prepare for. It was so heart breaking and harrowing to hear my wife waking up during the night, clutch her tummy and for a second forget about our loss, only to relive it all over again when her mind catches up. She wanted to believe it was all a dream.

At the time of writing, it is almost 3 weeks after our boy went to sleep. There is an enormous sense of loss and emptiness - the feeling that the past 3 years of trying to conceive and bearing with all the pain endured during pregnancy all went to waste. No plans for the baby stuff already bought or gifted to us, they just sit here taking up space, and the half decorated baby room feels like limbo. The inevitably difficulty of living through future birthdays and seeing friends going through their pregnancies and raising their children.

&#x200B;

**Acknowledgements**:

It is easy to visualise this story revolving around 3 people, but the reality is this story features many, many others. Our family and friends would always win the best supporting roles - but I'd like to mention we received an immeasurable level of support from the countless nurses, doctors and midwives that helped us through it all.

&#x200B;

* The Kings Blood Pressure team - their professionalism and expertise contributed to the extra time we got with our boy, to give him the best possible outcome and making sure mum stays healthy. It was also essential for us to know we had a consistent team of people looking after us, allowing us to become familiar names and faces.
* The neonatal team and maternity wards - the midwives, nurses and health care professionals that were dedicated to our day-to-day comfort, measuring blood pressure, drawing blood, and also important - giving the NHS a human face with their distinct personalities and touch. We thank them for their compassion.
* The NICU team - this must be such a difficult job, to juggle so many fragile little babies, staying calm under pressure and knowing exactly what to do. It is easy to forget that nurses and doctors are just human, and can't help but to be affected by the loss of any baby they cared for. We are so thankful they were able to be so compassionate during our boy's passing. They removed all medical devices and equipment from our son, and helped us bathe and dress him.
* 4 Louis - this is a charity targeted at parents of stillbirth and loss. We were provided with baby clothes, toys and hand print kits. We are so thankful this was available, as it allowed us to have some 'normal' moments and memories with our boy.
* Funeral directors - Our funeral director did a wonderful job. We did not realise the industry does not charge for babies or children, which moved us very much. The hospital explained the government created a fund to help pay for such arrangements for children, but we later found out much of the funeral industry did not charge even prior to the fund, and many don't claim from the government. My only regret here is I wish to retain anonymity and cannot name our local firm - but send me a message if you are in the London South East and want to know.

&#x200B;

**Closing:**

This clearly was not a story with a happy ending - but I think there were happy moments at certain points of our journey. We realise there are those who have been more fortunate than us, and those whose stories have been more tragic. We hope our story provides further insight to these difficult processes, to be used to help and to inform. I am not able to go into detail on every aspect, otherwise this post would become a book - but please reach out if you have any questions or comments.

Thank you for reading.",124,48,2021-10-31,birth experience
NICUParents,Nervous about a second preemie,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this question but I’m hoping to hear others’ experiences. My first (and so far my only) baby was born in May of last year at 34 weeks due to PPROM. She spent 13 days in the NICU. It was really hard and really unexpected. We are talking about growing our family and possibly having our second baby sometime next year. I feel excited, but also so so nervous. No one can tell me what went wrong to cause the premature birth, just that there is a higher risk for a second preemie after you’ve already had one. Any NICU parents out there have a preemie and other full term children? I’d also like to hear if any parents out there had multiple preemies and how your experience went the second time around.",34,52,2020-09-10,birth experience
NICUParents,Little different experience | term baby in NICU,"My guy was born at 39+6 and weighed 9lbs 4oz. I almost feel silly posting here because so many of his NICU mates are less than half his birth weight when they graduate.

But he’s now on day 4 and will be there at least another 3 days but probably longer. Initially doctors thought he has transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) because of his fast breathing and desaturations. We thought we were looking at 3 days in the NICU but once he was off oxygen, he kept having cluster desats. Doctors say his breathing looks healthy so now they’re worried about his heart and/or lungs not transferring the oxygen to his blood. He’s also struggling keeping his bilirubin down despite being under the blue UV lights and supplementing with formula after his time at the breast and his pumped breast milk. 

Not knowing what’s going on is so difficult for me. I’ve also been staying with him while my husband is with our daughter (my parents are also watching her at times so we can see our son together). We feel like we have a son when we’re with him and then we feel like we have a daughter when we see her, but we don’t feel like we have two children. Our daughter is really struggling to understand why she can’t see “her baby” and keeps asking to go see him at the hospital.",58,33,2021-08-22,birth experience
