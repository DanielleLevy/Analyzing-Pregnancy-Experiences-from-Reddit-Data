BabyBumps,A normal symptom of pregnancy or an emergency you need to go to the hospital for? Lol who knows?!: A story of the 3rd trimester,"Seriously, you guys... This is ridiculous.

Is it just me or is everything you experience, especially in the third trimester, a normal symptom and also a huge deal simultaneously?

Puffy hands and feet? Well that's totally normal, especially if you've had some salt or been on your feet a lot. Or iT CoULd bE PrE-EcLAmPsIa!!!

Headache? It's because of the extra weight, off-center balance, stress, and bad posture... *Or your blood pressure could be so high that your eyeballs are going to pop out of your skull!!!!*

Abdominal pain? It's just your round ligaments, gas, acid reflux, Braxton Hicks, or stretching skin. OR YOU MIGHT LITERALLY BE DYING!!!! OR IN LABOR!!!

Back pain? psshhh that's totally normal! Unless it radiates to your thighs, which could also be totally normal, *OR you could be going into pre-term labor!!!*

I never wanted kids of my own because I’m terrified to give birth, and after my IUD went missing I decided to keep the baby and go ahead with everything. But I really don’t want to give birth vaginally. I trust medicine and surgeons and think I would prefer a c-section for a number of reasons. My MD suggested I ask people who have done it both ways and ask what the preference was, in terms of recovery or anything else that comes to mind.

Update: to be very clear I’m asking for points of view ONLY from people who have had BOTH a csection and a vaginal delivery. If you had one and enjoyed it then that’s great but that’s not what I’m asking for. Thank you",17,28,30/03/2020,c-section delivery,134,PRE,6,2,,6,2,,-1,-1,

Now, a few spaces for transfer have just opened up and, whatever happens, we can't afford to turn the opportunity down. This would possibly mean him moving over there mid/late Feb.

If this happens, I might have to move my maternity care from where we are in England, to the nearest hospital in mid Wales - and it would be very late in my pregnancy!
